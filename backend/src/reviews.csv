1,1,4," Part of the magic for me growing up as a boy was to buy (or be given) the new Hornby catalogue every year& even if it included 90% of the same products as the previous year.  I've still got my old ones dating back to the 70s and 80s somewhere.  These days the catalogue is especially informative in that it tells you the vintage of the rolling stock which is useful if you are dedicating your railway to one particular era and train company. "
2,1,5," Amazing detail& every credit to the photographer in this book& a worthy reference manual& as well as a sales brochure. even if you only have a passing interest in the hobby you will be transported to another time when we were all younger and in awe of the big trains."
3,1,5," This was purchased on behalf of my Dad. He is always asking me to look up 00 gauge engines online& so this has been a good buy as he can look at it anytime. Would definitely buy the next one 2015!It arrived quickly and in perfect condition :-)"
4,1,5," Everything I really needed to see what was on offer from Hornby in the way of trains.  Would not have minded it included an RRP as well though"
5,1,5," I collect them all as the glossy pictures are great and it is nice that you can still get catalogs to collect."
6,1,5," What a great book.  Extremely useful insight to all future christmas presents."
7,1,5," Useful info for someonelike me starting back into the hobby after many years"
8,1,5," A well produced very good quality catalogue.Super quality pictures."
9,2,5," Simple"
10,2,5," Excellent product everybody should have one or to of product  excellent  100 percent ok speedy delivery excellent i give it five stars CLASSIC TOY TRAIN SET TRACK CARRIAGES LIGHT ENGINE BOXED BOYS KIDS BATTERYdouble aa battery goes in top of engine"
11,2,5," I was extremely pleased with the train set really good value for money."
12,2,1," i found this item& not suitable for young children&  very difficult to keep the carriages together and the whole thing kept coming off the track.All very thin plastic. I would not recommend this item."
13,2,1," The Train did not work  and as it was a present for my young nephew for Christmas I was very disappointed but as it was only Â£7 it was not worth the fuss of ordering another"
14,2,4," Better than expected. It has a proper oval of track rather than just a circle. My 2 year old grandsn loves it although he finds it difficult to put on the track."
15,2,5," Brilliant little train.  Bought for my son who was looking for a train that looks like the polar express - he was not disappointed.  Great value."
16,2,3," train carriages kept falling track  of and the connectors not good. better on the floor"
17,3,5," This has gone down very well this Christmas. Adults and kids collectively enjoy its appearance from around the Christmas tree.Whilst I use this as effectively a Christmas tree decoration it is nevertheless a quality Hornby OO gauge model in its own right& and could be used year round for a modelling enthusiast.A word of warning would be that the model is delicate and intricate. If you have cats for example they are sure to damage the delicate parts as they seek to derail the train from the track."
18,3,5," My 1st Hornby& and I absolutely love it. It will look amazing under my Christmas Tree this year too. Takes minutes to set up& and works great. Smooth& quiet and fantastic."
19,3,5," Excellent value for money and fits around the base of most Christmas trees. My little boy loved it!!"
20,3,5," Perfect Christmas present for the |big kid| ordered as a Christmas gift for my dad& he loves trains. It arrived on time and looks great."
21,3,5," As Usual top quality Hornby quality& lovely cute set which kids of all ages will adore"
22,3,5," This was a fantastic item& and has finally made my Christmas village scene for all to enjoy. Thank you very much."
23,3,5," Great price& arrived in good time& packaged well& appears to be new and original& presentation of train package looks good& the train looks fab (realistic) and works well.  My little boy was thrilled...  Pity it didn't make any sounds..."
24,3,1," Really disappointed - train worked twice and then power unit stopped working just in time for Christmas. Son was really excited but the whole controller unit felt flimsy& which seems to have been proved by its decision to conk out."
25,4,5," Xmas box for grandson&am sure it will be great"
26,5,5," Grandson loved it. Hauls good load"
27,6,5," very good"
28,7,5," Beautiful model& If your a fan of the G.W.R& this loco is a must have& Just that."
29,7,5," Christmas gift for him in doors he will love it"
30,7,5," runs very smooth& good model"
31,8,4," Lovely quality from Kato."
32,9,5," I NOW HAVE A SECOND OF THESE BACHMANN POWERHAULS COMING AS THEY CAN TAKE REAL TRAINS BETWEEN 20-30 WAGONSOF A HEAVY WEIGHT."
33,10,5," This is an excellent HO scale diorama piece comprising of a long wooden wagon bearing a very long barrel or wooden cylinder& with two horses hauling it& and a driver seated on a driving bench. This is an interesting and finely-detailed model& and would be an excellent decoration for a farm or country scene.As you would expect from Preiser& these figures are of a high quality of manufacture& detail and colouring. Note that I originally paid Â£20 for my set& so it pays to shop around in your local model shops â€“ or even a distant one. I live in London& but find it worth travelling as far as Faversham in Kent to the Hobby Shop there for my models."
34,11,5," A nice little train for our layout and a change. Up to the usual Takara Tomy high standard. The little front light is not that bright but looks OK."
35,12,5," We love Tomica!"
36,13,5," Great product& for the price of the TTS sound I'm very impressed"
37,14,4," This was a present for my brother.  He said it is brilliant and has enjoyed making it. The service I received was good and although it took a little while to arrive it was worth the wait."
38,15,5," An excellent product at an excellent price !!"
39,15,4," Runs well with hornby dcc decoder."
40,16,5," A great addition to the Kato Glacier Express set bringing your train up to a respectable length and it comes in a quality presentation case. Delivery from Japan only takes a couple of weeks. Well worth the money."
41,16,5," Great value& although shipped from Japan arrived in good time."
42,17,4," This is a pretty decent starter set as a first step into model railways.You get a very nice detailed model of the Gloucester City and its tender& and three equally well-detailed model coaches. The locomotive is DCC-ready. (DCC is the digital control system for model railways allowing different trains to run at different speeds o the same tracks - DCC-ready indicates that the loco has a socket into which a DCC module can be slotted in future"
43,17,4," A typical Hornby starter set. The loco is nice and sturdy and has a good weight to it& and for a |railroad| model the detail is very good! The Pullman coaches are equally attractive to look at& and feel as though they will last a good while. The track included& while a fairly minimal amount& is sufficient to get the set moving comfortably. The only downside in my opinion is the controller feels very cheap. I would not expect to see much use from it. However for the fact I am viewing this as simply a test model for something much larger& it will not see too much heavy use anyway. The loco runs smoothly and quietly& and I can't wait to see it running on a much larger layout!"
44,17,5," Great item as usual from Hornby&Loco is well detailed above Hornby's 'Railroad' versions in my opinion.A nice quality set& far too good for younger children who would easily damage& though a good starter set for the enthusiast."
45,17,4," This is a lovely set to own and my only serious reservation is that you really need to spend quite a lot more on extras& to get the best out of it. As a starting point& it's great though.The track is good-quality but does need a flat& solid base. You'll need to spend time getting the creases out of the supplied 1600x1180mm |MidiMat| too.The detailing on the locomotive and carriages is pretty good. The conn rods move nicely and you can see inside the carriages& with their white `table cloths' and gold-coloured lamps. It could be better still but most people will be perfectly happy with it& as I am.The box suggests all sorts of further sets to enhance this one. The Basic Oval and Track Pack A (R8221) are included& to create an extended oval with a siding. Adding Track Packs B and C (R8222 and R8223) gives you a double oval with siding (but just one pair of points connecting them). D and E (R8224 and R8225) make it really interesting& but that's almost Â£100& so far& and you can still add F (R8226) for extra sidings. Oh& and you'll need a new 1800x1200 TrakMat& R8217& to go with packs E and F.Then you'll want to add accessories such as stations& signal boxes and engine sheds. The message is...don't imagine Â£150 for this set will be the end of your expenditure!Without at least the extra track& the set will be pretty dull unless you just want to go round and round in circles with the occasional foray into the siding. Hence 1 star deducted for 'fun'.Some parts& notably some of the couplings& seem rather fragile. I wouldn't recommend this set for younger children and would suggest 8 as an absolute minimum& and only with a lot of adult supervision. 10 or 12 would be better.Read more â€º"
46,17,4," This is the railroad version of the Duke of Gloucester which is slightly less detailed than the top of the range model and consequently less fragile. The three Pullman coaches are also from the Railroad range and do not have interior lighting as do the top of the range models. It is a pity that the roofs are silver and a bit |flashy|& they would have been better in grey. Another slight inconvenience is that the couplings do not match. The loco has the newer style couplings and the coaches the wider older style but this does not impede hooking up however. This train set was a real bargain at the price I paid at the time."
47,18,5," A heavily built unit of excelent quality and exacting standards. Superior to previous incarnations of standard stock and will haul six carriages with relative ease."
48,18,5," Excellent value and has brought all my rolling stock to the modern age of Digital& the Flying Scotsman locomotive has fantastic detail close up and runs so smooth on the tracks it is is a pleasure to see a age of steam."
49,18,4," Beaware...says DCC ready& but only works after you buy the separate dcc decoder (currently Â£16)...Well made train&lovely detail&  but we had to wait whilst we ordered the decoder..slightly annoying!...hence 4 star"
50,18,4," It is a lovely hornby train and maybe& someday& kids can play with it too& hee hee. Best regards. G"
51,18,5," Really impressed with the detail on this model& I have several Hornby models and put them in custom glass cases as static models they really look the part!"
52,18,5," Bought as present for my husband. He was delighted with it. Good price and delivered quickly. Would recommend to others with model railway interests."
53,18,5," Im sure my father will adore his christmas gift."
54,18,5," An excellent model& very detailed& my son actually ended up getting 2 of these for Christmas. The seller wad very understanding and took the product back and issued a full refund without any quibble"
55,19,5," This set arrived on the 27th and was in perfect condition thank you"
56,20,5," An excellent kit of an ex.LMS Stanier non-corridor brake coach that can pass muster as non-corridor stock produced by any of the 'Big Four' railway companies prior to Nationalisation in 1948. Produced from ex.Mainline/Airfix GMR tooling& these are simple to assemble kits that are easy to super-detail."
57,21,5," Really good service and great product. On time for Christmas :)"
58,22,4," I bought this Train set for my son and am a complete novice when it comes to Train sets.The Hornby set feels solid and attention is paid to the detail on the train. It comes with a mat& which is actually a giant printed poster. For the long term& a hard backing is needed.The track layout feels like it is the next size up from a basic layout as it already contains an extension pack.The train itself is not huge and looks silly pulling long  passenger carriages (as it would on a real train).It is quite expensive and had I not seen it at a reduced price& I probably would not have bought it (hence 4 / 5). The train can actually go quite fast in both directions. As novice I have discovered several features that must be well known to train set enthusiasts:The Trains can be tricky to get all wheels on the track. (I think there is an accessory to help with this)Big Long carriages do not like tight bends at speed (they come off).When using points to guide the train onto an inner circuit (I bought more track) you need to get jumper leads from Hornby and these are not included in Extension packs A"
59,22,5," Every child should own a train set& and lately I've started suspecting that every middle-aged man should have one too& so I ordered this so that  me and my little lad will have a shared interest. (And&  if he turns out to be more interested in video games and hoverboards and whatnot& that's OK too: I shall move the layout to my shed and drink homebrew alone& whilst building titchy windmills).It's nice to see& after not handling  a set since the early 70s& that Hornby still maintains that quality old-school feel& lots of detailed modelling and reassuring metal components. This starter set represents a small pre-war Welsh local service& with both passenger and freight carriages& but comes with a printed landscape mat which shows you how you might extend this into a more ambitious layout.It's very difficult to find anything to criticise about this set: I guess everyone knows that Hornby are the Dons of the model railway game& and the price is what it is: They've always been quite expensive toys. One issue might be that most larger layouts now are apparently controlled digitally& whereas this is on an old style analogue controller& which I guess means that if you decide to build up to a set with more trains& etc& this  set would have to run on a separate track?So& I'm really glad i own a trainset again& and am looking forward to spending my dotage buying tiny little tins of humbrol enamel in shades like GWR Olive Drab and staring into the windows of model shops wondering whether to invest in the  1/72 00/H0 Village Garage with Petrol Pump."
60,22,4," My son was purchased this train set for Christmas. My son is mad on trains and loves model train sets set up in shops& museums etc. I have never used a Hornby set before& but it is clearly well thought out& very detailed and is high quality. The first time I put it together I was surprised how fiddly it was& it certainly is not for a child to put together. The track was huge& but there is not an awful lot of variety to the set& it can be oval or circular and that's about it. It comes with a large poster of the ground that is ideal for aesthetics& but in the long term its best to be on some sort of hard backing - and here is where the issue with this is. It is such a great toy& very classic& but to put it on a board is so much more complicated than it appeared for a few reasons. 1. It's huge& to put it on a board you need a dedicated space where it could be on a table or put away in some sort of bespoke contraption. We have allocated space under a double bed for the board. A chunk of MDF this size is around Â£15-Â£20. 2. My second idea when I realised how much floor space it takes up I thought it may be better to go up a mountain for example& but to go up you need to slope very very gradually& otherwise it climbs a bit and slides back down. I put one side sloping up using a how to train your dragon book on each side and two at the end and it couldn't climb up the far end. 3. Once you accept its going to take up a loafs of space& and once you accept it won't slope upwards much you will naturally look to add variety to the track. We looked at having the large oval with two half circles on the inside by adding 3 3rd radius double curves in two places in the middle (total of 6)& as well as one more left hand curve and straight and two right hand curve and straight pieces.Read more â€º"
61,23,5," i am over the moon with this item exemplary service and fantastic value for the item"
62,24,4," It's a power brick& what more can be said? This though was the cheapest source for a non to cheap necessity - why it wasn't bundled I don't know!"
63,24,4," At first I thought it was not for the intended job& but was advised that it was working as expected and was doing the job as required& so it is a good price and very compact"
64,24,5," Works well as expected."
65,24,5," as described"
66,24,5," Just what I wanted"
67,25,4," This is an excellent addition to any diecast collection and a must for Harry Potter fans. Looks great in it's box."
68,25,5," This is a very good quality train. Not one to be played with but defiantly a collectors item for the future."
69,25,5," A great addition to my sons collection& well constructed& great design and attention to detail.  A great buy for any Harry Potter fan."
70,25,5," Toy was brought as a joke present for my father in law. He is Harry Potter obsessed and he enjoyed this gift very much. It is of good durability and looks very authentic."
71,26,5," Thanks very well made L"
72,27,5," Keeps my husband happy. Well impressed"
73,28,5," I have recently decided to rebuild my model railway after many years being stored in a box.  I needed a controller and decided that a Gaugemaster was a good choice.  As I will be building the model railway in stages I wanted something to get me started and the single track contoller was ideal.  It didn't take me long to get it conected which is simple. I found it to be very smooth and I could maintain any speed& even very slow speeds without a problem and it would just run at that speed for as long as needed.  I will in due course buy a Gaugemaster multi track controller but this is ideal for what I need at this time.  I have been using this controller for several weeks now and I am still very pleased with it."
74,28,4," Next day free delivery! Very small& fits easily in the palm of my hand. Screw terminals for the outputs and plug in supply from the transformer input. Very smooth control of locos.Would have preferred the connections on the bottom of the unit for ease of handling."
75,28,5," very happy with my product. works great"
76,29,5," Brilliant! The joy on his face was the picture of Christmas! His reaction when the sound of coal shovelling was heard followed by the toot toot as the train started followed by slow but progressively faster motion of the steam train as it moves left my little boy speechless! A Christmas memory the I will never forget and according to him: |my best present ever!|Jorge"
77,29,4," It arrived late this afternoon. Looks gorgeous. However the 'Flying Scotsman' named engine (60103 according to my 1957 abc Ian Allan book on British Locomotive) was an A3 class not A1. Does Hornby know somethig I don't? I know they moved name plates of engines around but A3s were introduced in 1927 and A1s in 1945."
78,29,5," Bought as present for my myself!. Excellent& well constructed model. Great price and delivered quickly. I believe the |Railroad| range offers great value for all but the most exacting modeler."
79,30,5," yes would recommend it and according to the recipient's wish buy it again perhaps another model"
80,31,5," Lovely little engine& my son loves it& goes very well& he is chuffed to bits with it. Swift delivery before estimated date of arrival. Great value for money."
81,31,5," Good price even with postage. Cheaper than mending my old engine! Arrived earlier than expected."
82,31,5," Arrived before actual delivery date and what I expected so great service. Thank you"
83,31,4," Great Xmas present for son& loves it !"
84,31,5," Adorable little train."
85,31,5," great wee engine"
86,31,5," My Grandson said he didn't like it - he just loved it and it was his favourite Birthday present this year."
87,31,1," Ordered before Christmas and received it& spent Jan building track gave train to my son and it does not work.Found out today I cannot return...."
88,32,5," Just the job. Reasonable"
89,32,4," works great with Hornby engines"
90,32,5," nice 2 see smoke again"
91,33,5," Fab items !"
92,34,5," the cleaning wagon did everything I required it to do much better than I expected it hovered a lot of fluff"
93,34,4," Was bought this for Christmas.Ideal for cleaning track you can't reach.I have heard it derails on Peco points&which my one does.On close inspection I noted the pins on the point rodding sit above track level and catch the buffing/polishing wheel(these can be cut level with the track).The reason for four stars is&when I used the Dapol track cleaning fluid it broke down the adhesive holding the pads to the spinning discs&letting them fall off."
94,34,4," Good hover but abrasive pad and polish pad not so good"
95,34,5," It does exactly as it states on the box - good value. Caution: make sure that your ballast is glued in place!"
96,35,5," Good little train set& something different to the normal with having a crane.The crane is the normal Hornby Breakdown crane& which you can get in a 'steam era' rusty colour or modern painted yellow.  This one is red with a British Rail symbol on the side (like from the 1980s). Of course& that doesn't match with steam train (a few decades out!)"
97,35,5," Great amount of track& high quality crane and boxcar.lovely little loco& its not a |pocket rocket| it runs at a really nice speed for its size& its not a Mallard but its still one of my favourite locos I own(You can tell somethings good when a teenager gives 5 stars)"
98,35,4," Nice starter set - has the standard basic oval and Track Pack one track& and a midi mat. The mat is paper& so not really durable for using over and over again unless you build a baseboard.The locomotive is a little under powered for the wagons - you need to be quite gentle setting off to prevent slipping& and the crane is quite hard to position on the rails& so maybe not the best for younger children who might get frustrated with.The detail on the engine is quite basic - if you like realism a bit of weathering may be good to make it look a bit better. The crane is lovely and nicely detailed."
99,35,5," Present for My Son looks simple and different His first train set and a fair price"
100,36,5," Took a little time to work out the instructions which were in Japanese& but now working well and a great item."
101,37,5," Kato - made in Japan. Top quality N-gauge chassis. Picks up on all 8 wheels& drives through 4 wheels on one bogie. This is useful as it's easy to shorten or lengthen the chassis to suit. I am using it under a 009 diesel kit and have had to shorten it by about 3mm to suit. This was quite easy and much easier than most 8 wheel drive chassis. The chassis itself is an excellent and smooth runner. Gaugemaster deliver well packaged and promptly."
102,37,5," An excellent little motor unit for the railway on my model pier. It runs very smoothly on two AA batteries at a suitable speed. I just have to build a tram body around it that looks authentic for the surroundings. I have also ordered a four-wheel version."
103,37,5," Useful 4 axle chassis for N or OO9 gauge scratchbuilding& trams etc. Can be adapted to fit Yesteryear and TyPhoo trams. Very smooth running& good at low speeds."
104,38,4," I don't own any of Heljan's 47 but I find these Bachmanns (Diamond Jubilee is one of three recent additions) to be a huge improvement on the now ageing Lima models& but certainly worth the additional cost."
105,39,5," These are really nice quality HO coaches and lightweight too& so you can pull quite a number behind even the smallest loco.I bought several for branch line operation and they certainly add inpact to the layout."
106,40,5," great"
107,41,4," Just built one of these! The body is self coloured in the right colour and the sides are lined out and lettered. The ends need to be painted black. Apart from the roof ventilators (which can be glued inside the roof) the whole kit clicks together ingeniously. It took about 10 mins to assemble this kit and the next will take more like 4 minutes. The only transfers/decals are the round LMS logos you can see in the centre.I don't agree with the assembly instructions! The body comprises sides ends and floor in a single piece. There is a rectangular cutout in the floor for the metal weight. I would fit the interior seat moulding into the body first. There is very little space between the compartment walls and the side of the coach to feed the flush-glaze window strips in. (They can't go in first) Particularly on the 2nd window strip I was concerned that I might overstretch the coach side at the end and make the plastic go milky. I was relieved when the glazing clicked into the windows. At that point& with the windows correctly in place& the corridor connections can be slid in the ends and the underframe offered up to the body (upside down with the metal weight located). The underframe latches actually click into the window strips to tie it all together. Likewise the roof clicks onto tabs on the window strips. Ingenious!Assembling and fitting the bogies was quite easy. The coupling retainers were fiddly though. Each coupling is plastic with a black metal hook. One of the hooks fell off. There is a C shape feature which clips onto a plastic bar and I needed to crunch it slightly with pliers& then adjust outwards with a screwdriver again until it clicked into place. The hook doesn't lift and drop as freely as it should now. It's on account of that and not being able to build the coach in the assembly instruction order (without feeling I was going to break something) that I've docked a star."
108,42,5," I received this lovely train today and I am really happy with this purchase. I am not a collector but this is a gift for my father in law and I am sure he is going to love it. It is really well packaged& comes in its corgi box. Inside this box is a hardened case and the train is secured in it. The attention to detail is fantastic. It is in perfect condition and I am sure that this will make a lovely addition to anyone's collection. I really like the stories behind these trains and choosing of the name. It arrived really well packaged and very fast&4 days early in fact.  Great buy. May turn me into a collector yet!"
109,42,5," Well made and highly detailed model"
110,42,5," VERY GOOD AND ACCURATE MODEL OF THE DAYS OF STEAM. WELL DONE. Fits perfectly in my display cabinet with the other"
111,43,5," Happy with this purchase for our 4 year old grandson who is trainset mad."
112,44,5," Excellent engine arrived a day earlier than expected& extremely well wrapped. New and about Â£10 less than the list price. Just had a test both ways on my layout& runs brilliantly- thanks guys."
113,44,5," My son was very pleased with the product"
114,45,5," Arrived in good time. All good and works well. Son is very happy. Thank you."
115,46,5," So cheap but an excellent product. At this price any bulb failures experienced after switch on are no problem - just re-order some more. Arrived on time and were well packed. I don't know how this level of authenticity can be available at such a low price."
116,46,5," The item was excellent but the scale was 1/100 I would have preferred 1/76 scale. Some information of how to set up the lighting system would have been helpful ie. the size of transformer required for the no of lights being used in parallel or in series"
117,46,5," the single head lamppost lamps complimented the double head lamppost purchased to complete the trainset layout"
118,46,5," These are great& so bright and value for money"
119,47,5," My first venture into Hornby's new TTS system - I only have a basic Bachmann E-Z controller which can only provide functions 1 to 9 which work ok - I have no idea what functions 10 to 18 do - very frustrating.  All the mags have tested TTS so no need for me to comment - the chuff is too loud in my book& but otherwise I'm very pleased indeed with my purchase..."
120,47,5," Top notch train with sound& as good as the Bachman version."
121,47,5," Typical Hornby quality especially with their own sound chip which probably knocks over Â£120 off having to have one fitted."
122,47,4," Looks great& well packaged and arrived quickly..what more do I want"
123,47,3," With TTS Sound& this is a bargain. Smooth-running and nicely finished. 3 issues though: Not as detailed as the Bachmann version"
124,48,5," Very good product with fast delivery"
125,49,5," Absolutely great exactly what it should be.good quality. A very pleased partner"
126,50,5," delivered ahead of estimated date and is a first class item"
127,51,5," Excellent swift service and quality product."
128,52,4," A very good train set and very popular with the young infants in my family (from 2-5 years old).  The range of layouts that you can build is good and the pieces are easy to assemble even for little ones.  Both trains run well in the tracks.  The wood is a good fine grain that does not splinter easily& and is well finished& so is safe for children to handle.  It is also quite robust.  A couple of minor issues.  The track supports for the elevated section are rather too narrow and can fall over easily.  If they were a square section they would be more stable and support the elevated pieces much better.  This can be remedied by cutting duplicate supports and glueing them together to make the square cross section.  Also a couple of extra pieces to act as joining pieces would help add yet more variety to the layout designs.  One that is needed is another double hole joint and the other a double plug connector.  Nevertheless overall it is a highly recommended product that can keep youngsters safely occupied for hours.  But for these minor failings I would have given it 5 stars."
129,52,4," The only problem is that you have to play very delicately with parts of the set as the bridges are raised up on wood blocks that are easily knocked over by small hands and feet."
130,52,5," Fantastic train set& my 2y/o loved this.  A few of the connector pieces have come out but that is easily fixed- otherwise excellent condition and good value for money"
131,52,1," Looks great but poorly designed. Most of the track is raised up on wooden blocks easy to knock over my 3 year old was unable to use easily."
132,53,5," A superb model from Hornby of the ex.GER J15 0-6-0 mixed traffic locos which I remember regularly seeing in my 1950's childhood during long holidays with my grandparents in rural East Anglia. Only so far given limited test running this loco will soon feature on a layout currently being built based on the old GER Audley End - Bartlow branchline. Runs very nicely and incorporates a stunning amount of fine detail. Has me feeling quite sentimental !"
133,54,5," Walthers Trainline make great&  but not expensive freight cars - and they couple closer than Bachmann cars"
134,55,5," This is a first class model& up to the usual Kato standard. A superb runner& straight out of the box."
135,56,5," Excellent for the purpose  for which I bought it - making rock formations for a model raileway"
136,57,4," this is a suppurb addion to any train set n kids love hanging mail bags on the hook that the coach picks up n drops off as it goes round only problem is the the trigger mechonisums are a fiddle to fit to track n keep popping off! the instuction are naff but the drop-off works well over |railer uncoupler| track&"
137,57,5," This is a new addition to my Flying Scotsman train set& and fits in well with the other coaches already added."
138,57,5," Amazing. It really works.  Well done hornby."
139,57,5," A birthday present from my daughter to give me something to do over Xmas. I found it reasonably easy to fit to my track and with a few minor adjustments could pick up the sacks of mail. The grandchildren will enjoy this extra activity on an already busy layout."
140,58,5," Train set received in excellent condition good quality and worth the money as u receive additional trake side acceceriesAnd delivered well within time scale will be buying more item's in near future keep up the good work."
141,58,5," I bought this product for my younger brother's Christmas. It arrived well within the proposed delivery period& and in perfect condition. All of the relevant paper-work was included& and - most importantly - its intended recipient is thrilled."
142,58,5," Youngest son bought this with his birthday money. He is over the moon with it."
143,58,5," Good quality & well worth money  was delivered in good time"
144,58,5," My son loved it and best value I was able to find on the market& didn't disappoint and added track B very effectively."
145,58,5," This was a very good purchase for Christmas was a larger layout than expected but very good all the same"
146,58,5," bought this for my 7 year old son& its for xmas so he hasnt seen it yet& but im very pleased."
147,58,5," Great train set my grandson loved it.  P BARBER."
148,59,5," These signals are good value for money and are relatively straightforward to assemble from the instructions. Definitely worth a try for your first attempt."
149,59,5," Great product."
150,60,5," This is the older E7 model from Kato but still carries there quality hallmark& It fits in great with my Japanese model railway although you do need the 3 or 6 car extension to give it a better feel."
151,60,5," SMOOTH RUNNING TRAIN VERY PLEASED WITH DELIVERY"
152,61,4," Excllent model with accurate details."
153,62,5," See review for over head station"
154,62,5," All good"
155,63,5," Good track& good tight fitting& perfect&"
156,63,4," good product"
157,64,5," Bought as it's cheaper than the alternatives for basically the same thing. Looks the part& engine drive not tender thankfully. Very well detailed and the seller I bought from was faultless& arriving by Parcelforce three days later."
158,64,5," This is a really nice looking model train.It is DCC ready and in the oo gauge scale.The details are really nice and I just love the colour of this model train.I have wanted this for a long time and I am not disappointed by it at all.My ratings of this model train are 5 star for fun as when this is on anyone's track it will not disappoint in the fun it will bring you.The educational value I have left blank as I don't really think that there is any educational value to this as its there to be looked at or used on a model railway track to be an addition to a collection of your model railway.The durable rating is 4 star as it feels nicely made and solid however I am sure if its dropped from a height then it would most probably cause damage and finally the overall rating is a 5 star as its a beautiful addition to any model railway.Highly recommended to any model train enthusiast or simply as a decorate model to just look at either way I am sure you would love this train."
159,64,5," This model is very reasonably priced & and the best thing about Hornby Railroad series models you can upgrade them with extra partsto look more realistic but they are good realistic models at the price in there own right& Recommended"
160,64,5," This model is equal in looks and performance to the more expensive Hornby version& although having a different motor& it pulls at least 6 coaches smoothly and easily."
161,64,4," bought this for my son's birthady later this month so rating is based on the quality of the other Hornby we bought at the same time for Christmas"
162,64,5," Railroad offers more robust options for younger users while still offering good performance. This product at this price represents outstanding value."
163,64,5," excellent value and could not ask for better service the engine was spot on and great value for money great"
164,64,5," A nice loco. BUT it does&nt go round tight curves& if the track is the new Hornby standard"
165,65,4," Runs well...need some mock passengers in the seats!"
166,66,5," My daughter loves this and runs and jumps about with excitement"
167,66,4," Loses a star for being too loud. It's great& otherwise. The lights are pretty and the bump and go movement is fun for my 3 year old."
168,67,5," Great model"
169,68,4," Arrived as expected and worked fine straight out of the box. It seems slightly wider than most so be careful if you use parallel tracks& especially flexible track."
170,68,5," Quick delivery& excellent great looking train set& very smooth running and fast. Good value with 4 car set& no problems at all with it."
171,68,5," Great train set for any enthusiast and a must have for all modern train sets"
172,68,4," Very good track needs to be on a board"
173,68,4," Good model"
174,69,5," Fantastic detail! A beautiful model traction engine. Hopefully recipient will be thrilled as brought up in the town where Pat Collins lived and became Mayor. His Wakes were held yearly during August Bank Holiday and were the highlight of summer. These beautiful traction engines were then always used to power the rides and alongside fairground organs are pure nostalgia!"
175,70,5," easy to couple with other models& great to expand set of power trains.  This is ideal as a gift to complement the starter kit which come with only one engine"
176,71,5," I bought this for my 2 year old grandson and he loves it so much. I have also bought him others in the series. They are very strong toys due to being die cast and do take a lot of banging and bumping about during play& without damage to their paintwork.My grandson is obsessed with rescue scenarios at the moment and loves to bring Kevin in to help if James crashes. The fact that James talks too enthralls him. He get's so excited everytime he gets a new engine& as he wants to hear what it sounds like. He has to date..Thomas& Spencer& Percy& Diesel& Toby&and some other's. He has Bertie bus and a small Harold too.It's great they have magnets too which means all the engines can pull each other and their tender's. He likes to swap them all about and put them all together in a long line. This is one of the toys I've seen him having the most pleasure from so far. He plays contentedly for hours with these engines& making up his own scenarios.I have more of these put away for him& and have just given him Spencer which he again loved.One little comment& I wish it was made plain in Amazon's product details which ones talk and don't. Which are die cast etc& I find myself sometimes going through products for an age& or going to other sites& to make sure I have the right one.Sometimes a search for talking brings up non talking in the mix as well. Not a major point and not a dig at Amamzon as I use them constantly and I'm always pleased with the service& but it would make shopping for these quicker and easier. Brilliant toys all round& great fun and kids love them."
177,71,5," Great little engine! My son loved the fact he lights up and makes sounds."
178,71,5," As all these toys this one does not disappoint. They are hardy toys which is a good thing with my 3 year old son and he gets alot of enjoyment out of them.Would recommend."
179,71,5," Lovely little toy& robust& well made and very amusing that it talks& will keep my Grandson happy for a while& shame its not a little bit larger but very pleased with it."
180,71,5," quite small-but perfect for any small Thomas lovers- my 2 year old nephew never lets Thomas or James out of his sight!!!"
181,72,4," The carriage arrived promptly & it is in good condition and described accurately. It was a little expensive although a little cheaper than a new product. In retrospect i would make the purchase again."
182,73,5," Excellent.  Well worth the wait for delivery from Japan. Fits n gauge passenger coaches really well. My 2nd purchase of this product from this supplier. Thank you."
183,73,5," A quality storage case for your N gauge trains. Easy to remove inserts. You just pull out the ones you want. No cutting is needed. My Kato train set fits perfectly."
184,74,5," Just what was required& a good buy& thanks!"
185,75,4," I paid 170. At that price it would have been nice to have a dcc chip supplied with the loco .Having said that& most of these are destined for display cabinets& as is mine. For that reason& it loses a star. Superb in every other respect."
186,76,5," Everything you need to get started bought seperately this set would be double the price - all you need is two DIY paste tables a room to put them in and a big kid to set up and a little kid if he is lucky to watch and join ion a little bit"
187,76,4," At Â£50 this is a bargain and a really good set to start off a model train hobby. My 5 year old was desperate to have his own proper train set and I was concerned over getting one of the >Â£100 sets so this fit the bill. The track mat is a great idea and didn't take long to assemble it all.My only problem was with the controller. Everytime there was a derailment& the controller would stop working for about 1 minute& one of it's safety features. I gave up with it in the end and got a better one off the Internet."
188,76,4," NOW ALL WE NEED TO DO IS KEEP BUILDING&AND HE'S LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT :) THIS IS HIS FIRST TRAIN SET AGE 7."
189,76,3," This product was really good to start off with.Unfortunately the motor carriage broke pretty quickly.To solve: take the blue roof off and charge a screw driver with static.Take dust off the motor by hand and then remove it with the screwdriver.After this has been great although for Â£50 you can get the lakelander with extra track and a much better motor carriage!Overall Good but better hornby out there..."
190,76,5," The look on my son's face said it all. This is perfect for any budding modeller. Will be putting the track on to a slotted board so it's quicker and easier to set up. My son's jaw hit the floor when he opened this on his 5th birthday last week. Excellent quality build too."
191,76,5," Bought this for my 4 year old train enthusiast..He loves it.. It is a bit tricky to put on the track but once it's on it's perfect.No good for a heavy handed child but as long as they are quite careful it's great.He has used it every day since Christmas"
192,76,5," Fab item great value for money! Would highly recommend this to all.A must for anyone's collection for hrs of fun!"
193,76,5," it is amazing great money you should get it for sny present ot home use detail is amazing and a great hornby set everybody should have one."
194,77,4," Model is a very reasonable representation of th real thing&  one thing that grates is the tender brake shoes not inline with the tyres& see no excuse for this |toytrain| extra.Bad point Bachmann."
195,77,5," Fine& would buy again"
196,78,5," Absolute superb kit and exactly what I wanted!I didnt buy this kit to just build a Rainbow& because in my opinion& I dont like the Rainbow type of ride (i think its rather boring!) I actually bought it so that I could convert it into a Inverted Pirate Ship for a small diorama.The Kit itself is fantastic& Highly detailed and a wonder to build. Its also very easy to modify if thats what you want to do!"
197,78,1," OK if you are in to ~Airfix models as these have at least 300 seperate pieces.."
198,78,5," Bit small I thought it was a real lot bigger But is very good"
199,78,4," Very good"
200,78,5," Perfect"
201,79,5," great addition to my collection"
202,80,5," arrived well ahead of time"
203,81,5," Great price and product. Very pleased with purchase and service."
204,82,5," This is an excellent HO scale diorama piece comprising of a high-sided blue heavy wooden wagon& with a driver standing inside it& and two horses hauling it. This is an interesting and finely-detailed model& and would be an excellent decoration for a farm or country scene.As you would expect from Preiser& these figures are of a high quality of manufacture& detail and colouring. Note that I paid Â£12 for my model& so it can be worth shopping around in your local model shops â€“ or even a distant one. I live in London& but find it worth travelling as far as Faversham in Kent to the Hobby Shop there for my models."
205,83,5," Smashing train grandchildren will love it"
206,84,5," Beautiful model& well detailed and has a solid feel to it. They say keep em in the packaging but i never listen hehe& regardless this loco model is truly beautiful"
207,84,5," A very good&  highly detailed model& a bit smaller than I expected but well made and well worth purchasing."
208,84,5," ALL THREE MODEL STEAM ENGINES ARE PERFECT THEY TAKE ME BACK TO WHEN I USED TO GO TRAIN SPOTTING AND WATCH THEM ROARING THROUGH THE STATIONS"
209,84,5," Excellent product well pleased with it. Delivery time great too."
210,84,5," excellent present"
211,85,5," Track needs to be very clean& and does not cope too well with points."
212,86,5," this train is amazing for young children as so well built and the carriage joining are so more less frustrating for them highly recommended"
213,87,4," A challenging assembly especially in the valve gear area& lots of lovely fiddly bits& be very sparing with the glue! I remember the same problem half a century ago with the original Airfix kit. Airfix original tooling is used to create a finely detailed modelWith painting care a couple or more kits are cheap enough to make excellent |props| rusting forlornly away in a siding waiting for the scrapman"
214,87,5," Fantastic little kit. Some fiddly bits but with careful glueing and assembly the drive gear and wheels will turn. Would buy again."
215,87,3," cant relly comment on it as I have not built it yet but the moulding looks okay for the age of the original kit&for the price I dont expect it to be perfect."
216,87,5," This is my third& need I say more."
217,88,4," nice not suitable for my grandson"
218,89,5," First rate little models& beautiful mouldings nicely painted and simple to click together. I've caught the 'Shorty' bug !"
219,90,5," As usual from Dapol& quality kit.Easy to follow instructions and with care an excellent model appears.Paint and glue required"
220,90,5," Good value exactly what I wanted well packed will buy again when required  a good range of products well done"
221,90,5," Good item for the model railway& 10/10"
222,90,5," perfect"
223,91,5," Excellent model loco with finite detail"
224,92,5," It was a Christmas present for my grandson I brought it because he like playing with trains and things like that."
225,93,5," Very good.  Don't forget to include a current limiting resistor.  That said& they draw so little power& I have 30 of them on a layout.  I've also painted them with a translucent yellow paint 'bright white'."
226,94,5," This product is designed as a scale model for adult collectors - it is not a toy for children and the Amazon category should reflect that.However& turning to the actual product - the Sir Nigel Gresley& A4 Pacific Class Locomotive model which is supplied with tender - it is a nicely presented scale model which is highly detailed in terms of paintwork& wheels& pistons and piping etc.  The amount of work that must have gone into producing this model is significant and it has resulted in a good quality model& especially in view of the price. I think the finish is very good although it is a static model eg. the wheels etc. do not rotate and it is fixed to its stand which is effectively a short length of track. The real locomotive is preserved by the North Yorks Moors Railway and this replica certainly does justice to it.The model is supplied in an outer sleeve which protects a clear plastic case& in the case of my model it also has a removable thin plastic film over part of it as an additional protection. At the price you couldn't really ask for more& and& if like me& you are short of space& the 1:120 scale is ideal. Recommended."
227,94,5," I bought this as a present for my dad for Christmas as he is a massive fan of trains especially 'Sir Nigel Gresley'. It is a shame that it doesn't go on his railway track but it is still a very well made and lovely product. I would defiantly recommend this as a gift for someone who is a fan of the rail legends."
228,94,4," He was delighted with this model. As a train fanatic he was not disappointed. He has seen the real Sir Nigel Gresley on a number of occasions."
229,94,5," Bought as an 80th birthday gift for retired train driver. He loved it!  May buy similar for may husband& who was very impressed."
230,94,5," Bought this for my husband and he loves it. Good attention to detail  and all round a good buy and worth the money"
231,95,4," Although the review title is positive I do have to start off with a small compliant. Although the package arrived and appeared to be well protected for some reason the front 4 wheels/bogey area was not connected up to the rest of the train and it took a while to figure out how to fix it on properly!That said& I think this is most likely an unlucky one off. The train set is good value for money (especially when compared to the crazy prices for the DCC already installed trains!)& the locomotive and carriages appear to be of a very good standard and it runs excellently so far. No regrets in buying this at all!EDIT - I now have to add another negative point... though it has a happy ending. After a day or so the locomotive stuttered and stopped. It had occurred to me while it was running that it sounded a little rough compared to what it should sound like but the stoppage was quite sudden... though it did get going again it was stuttering still. If you come across this apply some small amounts of machine oil to the areas mentioned in the maintenance guide that comes with this train set and then try and running it for a few minutes and it should return to normal!"
232,95,4," This is one of the most popular trains in the world and Hornby has produced a very good model which looks like the real machine.Before I purchased this train set& I did some research and found that there are several versions of the Flying Scotsman train set.The versions are:-1) Flying Scotsman train set which includes two coaches& oval and track pack A.2) Flying Scotsman train set which includes three coaches& oval and track pack A.3) Flying Scotsman train set which includes three coaches& oval with track pack A and B.As I already have the Eurostar train set with Track packs A&B&C and D I decided to buy No.2. I have used most of the track to integrate it with my existing train set& and will extend it later when I buy some more points. That way I don't have any room for Track Packs E and F.The detail to the engine and the tender are very good and when it runs you can see the connecting rods moving. The three coaches are of good detail& you can see into the windows& each coach has 1st and 3rd class compartments (2nd class disappeard sometime ago) and both the corridor and seats are clearly visible.Putting the train on the track took a little time and care is needed when coupling it to the coal tender and the rest of the train.I found that the Flying Scotsman does require a very flat surface to run one& and time needs to be spent getting all the creases out the base mat.As this train set is at a cost& I would not let young children play with it on their own& but under adult supervision they should be able to enjoy this train set.Read more â€º"
233,95,1," Especially as discounted by Amazon& this is a good price for what is mostly an attractive and well made train set. I'd classify it as a younger-modeller or beginner's set in that the detailing isn't as fine as Hornby's more expensive models& or of some of the others in the market& e.g. Bachmann.The track is pretty good quality& but does need laying carefully on a hard and properly flat surface - I certainly wouldn't use the trackmat on the floor. Train sets like this really need a level of preparation and investment in a solid baseboard& and without one you'll run into problems like some of the other reviewers.The real problem I have is that the coupling on the rear of the tender that connects it to the carriages is ridiculously flimsy"
234,95,5," Despite some negative reviews regarding the quality of the layout mat& we decided to take a chance and get this as a Christmas present for our 12-year old son. Surprisingly& the mat turned out to be made of vinyl and not paper as described (I guess that Hornby listens to its customers!). This on top of the high quality track& carriages and engine& it made the perfect gift. A little forward planning helped as we had a sheet of thin board ready to ensure a smooth surface for trouble-free track set-up. The bottom line is that our son is thrilled with the set and is currently shopping for track expansion sets to spend his Amazon gift vouchers on!"
235,95,5," I had small clock-work train sets and& eventually progressed to a small electric train-set with a circular track - the train did smoke (when it was in the mood) but mum was wary of letting me play with it alone and& in any case it only went round in circles. I am now the proud owner of the Flying Scotsman from the famous Hornby and this particular (OLD) little boy is like a dog with two tails (at least). What a wonderful set& designed as a complete starter set with mat& track etc etc.This quality product is very possibly going to be the start of something big& very big. It would make a dream gift for any boy OR girl (whatever age) by a maker that you can trust - and you get an iconic engine as well with its wonderful colour and memories of times past....."
236,96,4," I needed a low voltage switch in my recording studio and this fit the bill very well the cost is a bit high for what it is but it does the job I need it to &service very good"
237,97,5," A smooth quiet running loco with excellent detail. A great addition to my layout."
238,98,5," I love it. Perfect with the earlier ordered locomotive.Again: I would recommend it to the masters of the topic. It's not just a toy."
239,99,5," Absolute bargin so good I bought two. I been after this type for a while. Plastic and metal& well moulded."
240,99,5," great item to add to railway sets"
241,100,4," Really solid metal construction. British made. It's how kit used to be made. Additional outputs add ancilary power. Nice solid controls."
242,100,5," Delivered on time and works well."
243,100,5," Works as expected. Thank you."
244,101,5," So very good& wished I had ordered 2 now."
245,101,5," fantastic"
246,102,5," AOK"
247,103,5," VERY PLEASED"
248,103,3," Overpriced with very little detail."
249,104,5," Excellent models."
250,105,5," brilliant little camp site&purchased at grandkids request to fit into scenics on oo model railway.matches in great grandkids love it."
251,105,5," Well made and designed. Ideal for the home modeller or collector."
252,106,4," the product is good and it runs smoothly on my track& word of warning it is not a motorized unit& it istwo cars that go on the front and back of the main train& they do light up& and theoretically you could get a katomotorized chassis and swap one of the middle boogies for a motorized one& but i haven't tried it.apart from that it is a well built and sturdy model and it is a really good purchase"
253,106,5," ok bit disappointing no English instructions??"
254,107,5," Good item well pleased&good service."
255,108,4," This model is DCC ready as the description states.. It is ready for a digital chip to be fitted  by new owner. If the model has a chip fitted by the manufacturer& it is described as DCC fitted."
256,108,5," Bagnall industrial locomotives are hardly represented in the model market.  This delightful loco is therefore very welcome!  It adds character to a layout and runs very well - with DCS I would expect it to perform superbly.As a model& it is slightly chunky and possibly a bit taller than original - but it is running on 00 track& so the purists have much to do anyway.  It stands detailing and weathering well and can rapidly be made to look the part.  Bagnall products were characterised by endless variety about a basic design& so small departures from scale are not really an issue.The biggest compromise on looks is with the chassis - but Hornby have made the sensible decision to adopt an available& proven option.  Much improvement in looks can be acheived by installing 'skirts' to cover the wheels.  It will then much more resemble the prototype& at little cosmetic and no mechanical work.This is a great success at the ready to run stage& and forms a good base for detailing for the more advanced enthusiast.  Well done!"
257,108,5," thanks"
258,108,5," fantastic"
259,108,1," Not DCC ready as advertised"
260,109,5," A superb model at fantastic value very pleased with my purchase."
261,110,5," HAPPY WITH TRAIN GOOD DELIVERY THANK YOU"
262,111,4," Runs well....need some mock passengers in the seats."
263,112,3," I ordered this engin and 5 letters to spell a name as I thought it made a delightful christening gift& I had seen them in other peoples homes and knew its what I wanted. However when I received the letters they are green& blue& green& blue& red. Not the best mx of colours& I expected to receive one of each colour& but there is no yellow& the red letter on the end looks a bit odd. If I order again I would specify one of each colour. Also the letters on the carriages are not glued on they just come off which I had not expected. Not quite as robust as I had anticipated."
264,112,3," My children love these& but it's very annoying that the letter doesn't actually stay attached to the train. It just slips on and off& and is therefore mostly found off the train rather than on."
265,112,5," Loved the product.  It is very colourful and  I thought that the  magnetic fixings are brilliant and better than the usual fixture that other sets use.  Highly recommended"
266,112,3," Not a bad little train but very expensive compared to cost of much bigger set bought. Letter not fixed so easily lost"
267,112,4," Seller was very prompt and very helpful and contacted me via email and phone. I would definitely recommend this seller to anyone. Even organise a refund for me as he noticed that we had over ordered a letter by mistake without us even asking for one.Toy looks great and seller has organised it well for us& have not tested these items for durability yet though!"
268,112,5," I have bought similar trains in the past and they make ideal christening / birthday presents. They can be used for display when the baby is small and then be used as a toy when the child gets older.This item is good quality and is well presented.My friend loved it and I will definitely buy again for future christening presents."

270,112,4," The letters lift off so as they say it isn't suitable for young children unless you remove the letters and put them on when they're older. Fits most standard train tracks. Looks lovely as a personalised gift. Shame there weren't more choice of colours for each letter& lots were unavailable."
271,113,5," This is just some hornby single straights tracks& i bought for my train set.What can you really say? its a peice of track& none of it was broken& nicee clean& it all had warning stickers on.Thats about it...Perfect."
272,113,5," This is a piece of model railway track with a well known brand name.  Even though they are manufactured in China these days they still seem to be made very well."
273,113,5," FIT FOR PURPOSE& GOOD BUY& GREAT PRICE& SPEEDY DELIVERY& WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY.IT'S A TRAIN TRACK THAT'S ALL FOLKS."
274,113,4," ideal for the use"
275,113,5," value for money"
276,114,4," There is little choice in the H0 market for High Speed Trains& and Mehano had a niche market. Thankfully& in my experience with the Thalys and now Duplex models& in comparison to the similarly priced Joueff - later Lima/Hornby - these couple and run better!This set& bought as one of the last available in 2013& was made in 2004 (date stamp in box)  and I have since discovered an italian stockist has 5 more available at lower cost: Dealers nearer to the area these trains ran naturally seem to charge higher prices."
277,115,5," These trains are basic& but a great little runner& I have a full set of 5now and I also have much more expensive trains and these run just as good and even better than some of them& so please make some more of similar trains."
278,116,4," My daughter is getting quite a collection of Mashers& and this set is her most recent acquisition. As with all of her other Mashers they are well made and hard wearing& and lots of fun.We've had hours of fun swapping pieces around.Negatives? Loki's horns keep falling off& which is very irritating.The Hulk and Loki are very different sizes& so their accessories aren't as interchangeable as some other Mashers. They fit& but tend to fall off or just don't look right. I wouldn't consider this a good starter set for that reason."
279,116,5," my son was very pleased with his purchase."
280,116,5," Excellent service very happy 6 year old :)"
281,117,5," My Nephew loved this& a soft toy for a boy of 7& he liked playing with it and pressing the button to make the sounds work& It was great to see him play and be rough with it& without fear of breaking."
282,117,5," Absolutely great. A good piece for the collection."
283,117,5," Excellent item fast delivery"
284,118,5," I love it& the kids love it and their friends love it."
285,119,5," My kids love Yoohoos!  And this one is super cute!"
286,120,5," arrived the next day.Very good quality& the plastic outer layer is good and easy to clean.got it for my daughter's birthday she  loved it& good quality great product.very happy with it thanks"
287,120,5," Perfect little messenger bag for my 3 year old daughter& its cute design and well made.Bought for my daughter to store her leap reader and books in and its perfect"
288,120,5," My 6-year old niece LOVED this bag which was bought as a birthday present. I can't imagine any other little girls of a similar age who wouldn't feel the same!! :0)"
289,120,4," Good product& for the price. appears sturdy and easy to clean& which is great for primary age school children to carry their reading books."
290,121,5," Super cute and cushiony! Was a gift to my sister-in-law and her new baby. They loved it!"
291,122,5," Very pleased with this kit.  My granddaughter was very proud to show me the finished article.  I will be keeping any eye out for other kits which might be suitable."
292,123,5," Item is as described. Very fast delivery."
293,124,5," As described"
294,125,4," Bought this for my 2 year old& as he has a new found love for Mickey Mouse.It is well put together& but not as full or fluffy as a genuine Pillow Pet& but for less than half the price for something that will probably be forgotten about very soon& it is still worth it.One thing worth mentioning is that unlike a Pillow Pet branded item& the rough side of the velcro fastener is not covered when not being used& so if you're not careful it can cause a serious scratch.My little one loves it so I can't really complain.Remember you get what you pay for."
295,125,1," I was very disappointed n this product. I sent feedback to the seller but I have not received any reply. The product was not a true disney character. The face is very poor. I bought this believing it was authentic. I do not believe it is. The red color is pale. It was a Xmas present by not now"
296,125,4," Very nice wish the colour would have been more red a bit pinkish"
297,125,5," Lovely pillow& good quality and quick postage"
298,126,5," I have yet to find someone who doesn't become hooked on this within minutes!  I first discovered Shut the Box at a Pub Olympics and reckoned that it would go down well on a family holiday.  I was right.  From age 11 to 80+& everyone loved it and it occupied far more of a wet and dismal holiday than I could ever have imagined& spanning the generations perfectly and allowing for either solo players or a team challenge.  It now lives permanently on the coffee table and visitors all seem to find themselves strangely drawn to it& whilst my elderly Dad reckons that it keeps his brains sharp and my nephew claims that it hones his mental arithmetic.  One of the best buys I have ever made and genuinely |fun for all the family|."
299,126,4," This is a great little wooden game for children and adults  helps with the maths and IS FUN. I have recommended to friends and family."
300,126,5," it's well madeI purchased this woonen shut the box for a friend because we have one &and we were all playing the game at christmas and she loved it .it's a great game to play"
301,126,5," This arrived in good time and well packaged.  Recommended by relatives as a game that really grips you.  Two grand-daughters love it also and it helps with their mental arithmetic."
302,127,4," Excellent looking dice. However I believe they are cursed& as for the first week I could not role about 50 on the d10 and d%.Its fine now after bathing them in the sacrificial virgins blood and eating a horse heart as offering to the god of dice."
303,127,2," Lovely dice to look at& the numbers are clear.  Unfortunately& like many non-transparent dice from chessex& these turned out to be unbalanced when I checked them in salty water& and therefore useless as a dice since when using them they would end up landing on the same area of numbers each time."
304,127,5," Very good set of diceClear and easy to read the result of the throwNice marbel smoky effect from the orrange weaving in the blackness.High quality can be thrown hard and no chips& all the gold engraved letters were there unlike other sets of dice."
305,127,5," Lovely dice - a decent size and ripples of colour through the dice& which is brighter than indicated in the pictures. I've ordered every color - you can never have too many 20-sided dice in D"
306,127,3," The blue set I got were quite heavy with the blue and not as varied in color as the other sets& except one die. Perhaps its just my luck with the pouring."
307,127,4," Their Dice. Dey roll& and display numbers. Anything else?I guess sometimes the random colours make reading the number a little hard."
308,127,5," arrived two days earlier than the estimate given& and the dice are of the quality I was expecting. Very pleased with this purchase."
309,127,5," Arrived two days earlier than the estimated time& the dice themselves were exactly as I expected them to be. Would recommend."
310,128,5," The design& which is printed on both sides is simple& but looks great. The bag isn't huge& but then it doesn't need to be. it will comfortably hold 3 sets of standard 7-dice sets& with room for a 4th if required. A worthwhile purchase."
311,128,5," High quality& sturdy bag& giving this feeling that it could be an item |inside DnD| :-)Space for 2-3 sets of dice - use it for my special ones. Going for the dwarfed version as well."
312,128,5," Q-workshop. I have ordered 2 items from you& both for a friend and both arrived 3 days early. Amazingly quality and perfect for about 2 or 3 poly sets& or 2 Poly's and about 6 d6"
313,128,5," Very good quality. Nice and simple style."
314,128,5," Looks amazing!"
315,129,5," i needed replacement dice as i had lost my old dice. When they arrived a day early compared to the delivery estimate they look really good and the light really does capture the pearl effect. they didn't come with a dice bag but I have some in mind for them."
316,129,5," I just bought two packs of these as my first set of roleplaying dice. I wanted something cheap but a bit nicer looking than just solid coloured plastic. These are great. The marbled grey and black plastic looks neat& kind of like obsidian or something. I was tempted by some more colourful versions but I wanted to be sure the numbers would be really clear& which maybe they would be with coloured dice as well but they definitely are on these. They roll fine& there are no chips or scratches on any of the dice and all of the numbers are neatly engraved/painted. Well worth the price."
317,129,5," I bought two sets of pearl blue dice and to my delight they came a day early& there is no chips or scratches and the pearl affect looks really awesome! i will definitely suggest these to my friends."
318,129,3," These are ok dice. Bit small& few irregularities with the number painting as there is one or two smudges. But they roll well& no problems there. And pretty with a pearlescent finish. Average dice"
319,129,5," Super fast delivery and lovely dice! The prismatic effect is really nice."
320,129,5," Good quality dice - bit hard to know what more to say :)"
321,130,5," Delivered to me extremely quickly& I bought these in preparation for a proposed RPG evening with some workmates. The colour appealed to me and they really are gorgeous looking dice& even more so in person. The marbled effect is very attractive. They do look better in person although the numbers on mine are gold rather than silver as pictured."
322,131,5," Quality is good& dice produce random numbers every time.Well done dice.Fun to use and a good variety set.I'd recommend this seller"
323,131,4," Bought for a replacement set of dice for DnD. They look exactly the same as in the image and are totally worth the price.However& if they were able to come with a little pouch to hold the dice in& then I think it'd 100% be worth every penny"
324,131,5," Exactly as described and my son loves them.  Prompt delivery and good price."
325,131,5," My son is thrilled with these dice. Thanks!"
326,132,4," I was inspired to buy a box of dice after attending a year one maths class with my son. Having seen the kinds of things they do in class that involved touching& colours and repetition I thought having a mixed bag (literally) of dice would be a fun for all of us to use as counters for bingo& counting or even building games. These dice are brightly coloured and feel like they will last for a long time. I will always know where to go when one of the other board games is missing its dice !  These 16mm dice are quite big and chunky& the 12mm a little bit smaller than the norm."
327,132,5," Used the dice for our older members @ Lunch'n'meet to have a beetle drive--great for counting-dexterity [shaking and controlling dice] and much fun. just the right size& and no sharp corners& and the bright colours made them easy to see."
328,132,5," Twenty-four dice& six colours& four dice of each colour. All this and a great bounce. You can't ask for more than that."
329,132,5," These dice are small &the average size really& and they are pretty to look as they have a polished look.They came in a bunch&quite a lot of them so I felt they were worth the price and they arrived on time."
330,132,5," Simple fun& good for all your games and durable in colour and substanceI've used these to have a supply for family board games& as party bag fillers and the same supplier has plenty of vivid hard wearing colours to choose from& all as good quality."
331,132,5," They're dice& the look like dice and they roll and come up with a number when they stop rolling. If you're looking for dice like these then I would say |Yes& Buy these dice&| Arrived when they were supposed to as well."
332,132,3," Have ordered these before twice.  This lot were not such high quality as before and did not have an equal number of colours which is a pity as we use them to help children count/match etc."
333,132,5," Great quality cheap dice.  Okay they were different colours and not white when received& but who cares about colour?  Great seller& great dice! Nuff said."
334,133,5," Brilliant dice& but please note these are meant for players of the Arkham Horror games. As such they are perfect for players and highly recommended."
335,133,5," Love these Dice& But I love anything Cthulhu or H.P.Lovecraft. They are a bit expensive but you will only ever really need one pack to replace the dice in The Arkham Horror Board Game. And its such a nice game why not treat yourself to these. And the miniatures are due out for the game shortly to. And I cannot wait."
336,133,3," For the price& I was hoping for a bit more in the way of quality. A bit more weight& sharper and neater artwork on the dice etc is needed to justify the cost. Would not recommend at this price."
337,133,5," So I guess the main thing is& why spend the best part of Â£10 on 5 dice?Well first& they are nicely and pretty finely detailed and make a change from bog standard dice. The simple black and green colours somehow make me automatically think of Cthulhu and the Lovecraft Mythos"
338,133,5," Great solid dice that add some mythos fun to Arkham Horror. A little expensive& but they are what they are. I want some more now!"
339,133,5," Good quality dice& I was worried that the design would make reading the numbers difficult& but to my surprise they are quite easy to read. The design is very nice and is etched on& sides 5"
340,134,3," All mine were blue. The picture is a bit misleading"
341,134,5," Nothing wrong with the dice or the delivery. I got them her in Denmark very fast! I have read some reviews before ordering& so I knew that I would get only one color of dice& but I was still a bit dissapointed when they were all white."
342,134,4," They're dice& they're cheap& but they weren't coloured. All 10 were white."
343,134,5," Fantastic- I get through so many. I'm sure they lose them on purpose."
344,135,5," Just as seen& and great quality.Much better than the usual old boring white dice. Just try not and fight over colours"
345,135,4," bright colours - couple of dodgy ones in pack - but cheap enough"
346,135,5," Do you play a lot of board games? Then this pack of dice is ideal to replace those that have disappeared - under the settee or eaten by the family dog (I kid you not!). Use the same colours or combine them for whatever game you play. A good price& well made and well packed."
347,135,5," I bought these because of some gamebooks I have which require dice.  They are good quality and the different colours make them more interesting than the standard white dice.  I would highly recommend these and the delivery was prompt and well packaged"
348,135,5," Wonderful price and quality dice - good to teach children colours and numbersOnly gripe I have - as there are so many a small case would not go a miss to keep them in one place."
349,135,5," Brilliant - good quality product"
350,135,5," Just what I needed as a class set of die for use in school& these are great quality and true to the product picture& I would recommend."
351,135,5," Good quality dice& even sized& and nice bright colours. Great to replace lost ones from games or so players can have their own set."
352,136,5," perfect product for my needs& magic and scamming people out of beer. Love bicycle cards and i love these too"
353,137,5," Exactly what I wanted to replace lost dice to be able to play with original game thank you so much"
354,137,5," I was introduced to liars dice by my son.  A good way to pass a long drive."
355,137,4," Super speedy delivery& does what it says on the tin!"
356,137,5," Just as expected and delivered in a timely manner"
357,138,5," You want five green pentagonal trapezohedron dice? Look no further& for they are here& and they are more than sufficient."
358,138,5," Quick delivery& good product. Very useful in maths sessions for games and generating numbers."
359,138,5," Good quality dice with a nice weight."
360,138,5," Works well in generating numbers!"
361,139,5," I initially bought this without taking any notice of the dimensions and it's alot bigger then i expected. The matts durable and easy to keep cleen and the kids love the fact that you can play with these inside or outside. I've used both these and the ludo game as contents for party bags and never had anyone be disappointed with them. Fantastic item for a fatastic price and provides hours of fun."
362,139,5," Bought this to use with students in a teaching situation where I use the ladders and snakes to reinforce teaching points. Arrived quickly and is exactly as adverised."
363,139,5," I bought this for incentive games for the team at work so didn't want to spend a lot.  It is very large and great for the price paid."
364,139,4," Delivered quickly and efficiently.  Ordered for my sons third birthday and really interesting for the children to play with outside in the garden. The dice is quite small for young children so requires supervision.  Overall very pleased with the purchase."
365,139,5," I ordered the large snakes and ladders game for my obsessed 4 year old and what I received was actually a 2 game set including LUDO& so I was very surprised and happy with the quality and service.I definitely recommend."
366,139,4," Good quality item and gave hours of fun to the children at school.  Highly recommended website. Need to see what other games the site has."
367,139,3," I liked this and the price was good too but I did find that the creases in the polythene board made it hard for the counters to stay put."
368,139,5," As with the ludo game this is great fun for all the family and kept us all amused for ages"
369,140,5," they look lovely and feel really nice they came fast as said and a little earlier then it said which was nice i will buy more from q-workshop in the future now need to learn 1 to 10 in Japanese so i can use them xD"
370,140,5," These dice are made very carefully and with exceptional attention to the details. Although they have been engraved& the workshop keeps the momentum of brush strokes."
371,141,5," Well - they are exactly what they say on the packet:  large dice with numbers on& but they are useful and fun and exactly what I was looking for.  We use them to play snakes and ladders with our three year-old."
372,141,4," Used outside on a large snake"
373,141,5," Really great!  We use them for my 5 year old to practice adding numbers together as nice clean numbers and soft to touch (incase they get thrown too hard!)"
374,141,5," As expected.Great size& good quality and great to use with board games to get little one to recognise numbers."
375,142,5," Overall I am quite happy with the dice& I wanted some big dice for when I play Magic the gathering - They are of a very good quality& and will definitely buy more if needed.I also uploaded a picture so it is possible to see how big the dice are compared to magic cards& the really are perfect for counters."
376,142,4," I got these dice for playing family games and D"
377,142,5," Arrived on time and met all expectations (I organise local funraising events for a national charity and the larger spotted die went down well with our members who like myself need a helping hand with the eyesight)"
378,142,5," Great dice& both my friends in the Magic the Gathering and Roleplaying community was impressed.I wish they were less rounded at the corners and that the spots would been a little larger& but that is inor."
379,142,5," A super buy and well priced. Dice of a decent size are a great toy and can be used in place of the frequently rubbish ones which come in so many games. Every home should have some of these beauties."
380,142,4," I bought these dice to use during our Spanish"
381,142,5," Very pleased with this&bought it to use at school with my special needs pupils. Excellent product&very fast delivery. Highly recommended seller&will definitely buy from again."
382,142,5," I needed the dice for a games club I help with& so I needed the extra size for those people with poor eyesight.  I was really pleased with the dice and the delivery time."
383,143,5," Nice dice& love the colour! Though they have been horribly unlucky for me so far& they're pretty enough to get a second (and third& and fourth...) chance."
384,144,3," The product quality and Q Workshops service is fine. Though& the images representing the products are not so good. Both the dice I bought and the dice bag appear in the pictures to have a green tinge (viewed on a Mac and a tablet). But in reality they do not. The images definitely look cooler than the actual product."
385,144,5," Fantastic quality and look great & all who use are very happy . Would definitely buy these again and happily recommend  to others"
386,145,5," Looking forward to Xmas fun with |Shut The Box|"
387,146,5," Overview: These are a set of cubes which show a different image on each face. The aim of these are for the children to roll them and put them in order to make a sequence ready for a story. The child is then to use their imagination to create a story based on those characters& props and themes.Intergalactic includes images of: planet& a pull down lever& stars& flag& astronaut& robot& satellite& comet etcUses: These are a fantastic resource to use in the classroom or at home. They come in a variety of styles which will suit different topics and children's interests. In the classroom they can be used individually with children or they could be used as a whole group with each child having a different image to add to the whole class story (e.g. sit in a circle and try to add a sequence to the running story). At home& or in the car journey they can be used to keep children amused and stimulated throughout.They are:> Compact& lightweight and durable.> Come in a lovely presentation box to keep them safe!> Have a different image on each face e.g a character& prop or themes/ideas.> Have a variety of themes to choose from e.g. other imagination ones and a new batman one has just been released.Would highly recommend to anyone who has children or works with them! They are fab!!!! Many hours of enjoymentActivity ideas:> Could be used to help develop EAL learners language recall. This may include rolling a dice and the children in the small EAL group need to say the key word as quick as possible. The first child to say it wins a point.> As a whole class each child could roll and dice and then one by one go around the room with each child adding an element to the story.Read more â€º"
388,146,5," This well made cubes are of the same excellent quality as those of the standard Rory cube collection and have that same weight and feel that says quality.The cubes themselves can be used on their own or they can be used with the standard set by replacing 3 random cubes from the standard set.  It adds a new dimension to the story telling giving the stories a more science /science fiction twist.  Great fun for all the family as even the youngest child can take part in one of humanity's oldest past times...story telling.  Although I'm not sure seated around a campfire in your living room is a good idea unless it's a mock up :DI thoroughly recommend these and the others in the Rory Story Cube range."
389,146,4," These symbols worked well with my older grandchildren but were not all easily recognized by the 5/6 year olds.  We haven't had this problem with any of the other story cubes we have."
390,147,4," Good product& slow shipping but from China I can understans."
391,147,5," Very nice dice"

401,150,5," Very cheap but good quality"
402,150,5," Well worth every penny"
403,151,5," thank you"
404,152,4," Needed over 50 dice for a training session so bought two lots. Don't ask!!This is a good quality product and the picture was a fair representation of what was provided. The order was received very promptly."
405,152,5," There's not too much you can write about Dice& but these are of a good size and feel solid and balanced in your hand and when you throw them. They are in the traditional black on white& or white on black style and come in 30 to a pack which makes them very good value for money. These will be perfect for any specific dice games& as well as replacing lost dice from any board games you may have. They could also be used as an inexpensive way of teaching kids about numbers and probability in schools. Great value for money.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
406,152,4," The dice was used for a beetle drive& so having 30 of them was very handy!  The kids had fun playing and it was a successful night."
407,152,5," The Dice are a great size and theres plenty of them& perfect fo Tabletop Gaming or anything else where you need lots of dice. Speedy delivery and great price& would definately recommend!"
408,152,5," The dice are nothing special - just dice whicb was what I was after.  The delivery was good however and so was the price.  I couldn't find any dice to buy in Edinburgh and we have a great adult dice game which needs 5 dice per person so 30 was just right."
409,152,4," Visiting Canada last September we were introduced to a particular game using 6 dice. We had so much fun so we have spread the word amongst our family and the dice I purchased has served 5 members of our crowd."
410,152,5," I bought 2 sets of the 30 Dice pack (60 Dice)and found them perfect for what I had in mind. They are an equal mix of black and white dice which I used for making up packs of 3 (of one colour) dice with a paper of meanings/instructions for telling fortunes with them. this is a non commercial venture I do it for fun& and when I gave them to friends they had a ball playing with them. The Dice are perfect size for this project& easily thrown onto tabletop and the spots are well defined. What more can I say? Very happy with product. (so were my friends)!"
411,152,4," Bought primarily to play |Red Dead Redemption| liars dice for my son!You actually get 32 dice (16 of each)& and it came with a free game.They're a standard size& so an ideal replacement if you have any dice missing from other games (Yahtzee& cluedo etc.)The markings are very clear on both colours& so all in all& a big thumbs up."
412,153,5," This is a fantastic game& and lots of fun for the whole family (not least the satisfaction when someone thinks they've won only to discover they've picked a dice with a bell inside).Handy hint: if& like us& you're a particularly competitive family I would recommend removing rings and filing sharp nails before playing as we ended up with a few scratches on hands by the end of it!"
413,153,5," Purchased as a Christmas present& to entertain the family when all stuck under one roof. You can play it two ways. Civilised and with everyone taking a turn& or more as the game suggests& shaking the dice and grabbing for the card you want so you can collect you card sets before anyone else. But be warned& if you pick up a card with a corresponding dice that chimes ... you can't have it. If you play the second version make sure you've got plenty of room and there are no breakables within the immediate area. Especially if over enthusiastic children are playing!  Really good fun. Recommended."
414,153,4," Great fun& easy game& up and running in couple of mins& fun for all& and a quick and easy game with loads of laughs& all have equal chance of winning& great family game"
415,153,5," Great game and good value for money& takes minutes to set up which is even better. Highly recommended."
416,153,5," bought as a gift but reports are that it has gone down well with the game players in the family!"
417,153,4," It was really good fun and suited all ages. Had a blast on Christmas day thanks"
418,153,5," I like this game as it's fast paced and compact enough to take on holidays. My hubby& who loves the logo game& hates it as its too quick for him!"
419,153,4," Really pleased to have found this game. Very simple concept.  In essence& you roll the dice try and match a letter on the dice to any one of the 9 face-up cards products and you win that card ... Almost!!  If you pick a dice with a bell then you don't win the card.  The aim is to collect 2 sets of coloured cards.  Simple to pick up.  Quite a small box so quite transportable.  I think I'm going to introduce it to my 6 year old as think she'll enjoy it too!"
420,154,5," I'm a writer and find these to be fantastic ice breakers amongst friends& and a fantastic stimulus for writing. Brilliant fun& suitable for all& and simplistically sensational. Would recommend to anyone who loves stories& whether they consider themselves a writer or not& these are just so much fun. Incredibly versatile too& allowing you to make up your own rules& combine with other prompts or sets& and enjoy with multiple people or just on your own."
421,154,5," my 4- and 6-year olds like their story cubes even more with the addition of cavemen and mammoths. These new cubes spice up the tales and make for fun twists& whether I'm playing with them or just listening. My 4-year old has no problems interpreting the symbols (or making up a meaning)& although adults may struggle with one of two of them."
422,154,5," These are a good addition to the main cubes but are too simplistic to stand alone. For any dinosaur lovers out there who want a creative way of coming up with some stories then this is perhaps a good way of planning your ideas. Or just a good family game."
423,154,5," We just love these& we have all the sets& they are great for long journeys& power cuts and holidays. The adults enjoy rolling them and creating stories too with lots of sets rolled together&(especially after a drink when the children have gone to bed!"
424,154,5," I bought this for the grandchildren. However& I find that it has enabled us to spend time together. Furthermore I'm surprised at how inventive children are& and how much they enjoy it. The youngest is four."
425,154,5," A grrrreat add on to the Rory''s Story Cubes range ðŸŠ  More inventive story telling  to enhance an already brilliant idea."
426,154,5," Great fun and they enhance the others nicely& the kids love them.  Another fab addition from the gang at Rory's"
427,155,5," Great Game"
428,156,5," Love it"
429,157,5," Awesome little game& brilliantly designed and easily played. The game takes only a few minutes to learn& which makes it perfect for a quick little game when you've got half an hour to kill."
430,157,4," fulfils my needs with a great theme& but age of war does it better."
431,158,5," Very pleased with the Dice"
432,159,4," Great quality dice& lovely detail& slightly hard to decipher what the numbers are sometimes. But other than that& great product."
433,159,5," Silly extravagance maybe& but ideal for the committed DM!"
434,159,5," Great product. Work well for D"
435,160,5," This is a great game for 2-4 players& comprising nine dice with a different letter on each face. A player rolls the dice and then has the opportunity to roll each dice again up to three times with the objective of making the highest scoring word. Each player takes a turn& and the scores are totted up. Play resumes back with the first player until a player reaches a pre-decided winning total.The way the scoring system works is quite clever too& in that there is a compromise between the length of the word and complexity of it& as each letter has a different score associated with it. To score the turn& the number of letters in the word is multiplied by the score of each of those letters (the tube includes a multiplication table to ease you through this).This is a rewarding game where the chance element is large enough to bridge gaps between different intelligence levels& but an enjoyable experience for all. I would recommend this as a family activity& or for out and about& as it takes up almost no space."
436,160,5," This is a really useful toy& if you're a teacher.I've been playing with the dice almost every day while I work with my SEN dyslexic child. We have such fun that we don't notice the educational value.I highly recommend this toy& and think that every class& in every primary school& should have it available for those |non-working| moments."
437,160,5," I purchased this game recently and have become addicted.  It's great for 2 players or more.  After playing it a few times& we settled on 4 minutes per person which is just enough to put the pressure on and keep the game moving between players.  Owing to its size and weight& its ideal to take on holiday for couples or families.  Beware though& you may need a dictionary to resolve disagreements in spelling!"
438,160,5," This game is fantastic. I'd been trying to invent a tactical& strategic game myself that just uses dice. I had thought about lettered dice also& but this guy just seems to have hit the nail on the head. It's very good.I was playing it last night and invented a patience version whereby you can actually play/challenge the dice.Basically you play as usual& but when it comes to the |dice's turn| you roll all 9 dice& then remove the vowels leaving just the consonants. You must remove at least 3 vowels. If you could only remove 2 max& then roll the remaining consonants again to produce more vowels to remove. The Dice similarly have 3 rolls max per turn but only if required. If after 1 or 2 rolls the minimum 3 vowels have been removed you then stop rolling. If after 3 rolls you have still only managed to remove 2 vowels max then that is just hard luck. You then add up the word value of the consonants as you would a real word& then multiply by how many consonants& again as you would a real word.? = vowel but Y does not."
439,160,5," Like many of the best ideas& Dicewords is very simple and the rules can be learned in a couple of minutes.  It has elements of Scrabble and Boggle (and no doubt other word games) but at the same time has its own unique character. It's extremely flexible: it can be played anywhere& with any number of people& for any length of time& and with any level of skill. It can be enjoyed by everyone - from the 6-year-old who can spell a couple of dozen words to the hardened Scrabble fanatic. However& what I personally enjoy most about it is the collaborative element. While Scrabble tends to generate long silences as players struggle with impossible letter combinations& and Boggle creates frantic mayhem while everyone races each other to get the most words& Dicewords invariably seems to encourage co-operation between players. Although each player has their own turn with their own letters& everyone else can watch them put a word together and this often ends up as a group activity. Most of my best words have been made with other people's letters! This does& of course& mean that winning the game is a rather random affair& but it's a great deal more fun than sitting silently for an hour or so. For this reason& it works well as a party game and is a great icebreaker if you have friends who don't know each other well. Of course& it can also be played in a deadly serious and competitive fashion& if that's what you want. Anyone who enjoys word games will love this& and I can imagine it would work very well in an educational environment too."
440,160,5," bought this for second time for a friend it is so addictive and durable educational with out being to complicated"
441,160,5," I purchased this to take on holiday as it hardly takes up any space.A notepad and pencil would be useful to take along as well& though by no means essential.I think this would be a terrific game for kids who are starting to read& though is equally good fun for any age group.Do be prepared to fish dice out from under the sofa though."
442,161,5," I just received the grey"
443,161,5," This is a well made set of dice and the patterns& designed by Anne Stokes I believe& are lovely. The D6 is particularly cool with the blades used in place of dots or numbers. The black and grey set is nice& the grey is quite dark but gives a nice 'stone colour' to the set and the black markings are still really clear."
444,161,4," Nice dice and delivered quickly& I'm only giving 4 stars as the dice are a dark grey rather than as they appear in the picture& this makes them less easy to read."
445,161,5," They look amazing& arrived in good time and the packaging was undamaged so... yeah& 10/10& good job guys :D"
446,161,5," Surprisingly good dice- engraved numerals and equally balanced. I recommend these."
447,162,5," While I would like to take a few stars off for the numerous critical fails I've rolled with them& they did at least add some comic relief to otherwise tense situations.That said& the only thing I'd actually like to point out is that you can choose which colour set you want by messaging the seller. I did not read that bit and got the ever sought after brown dice. They're very unique."
448,162,4," There were dice. I order dice. I am happy with my five dice."
449,162,2," Although they are perfectly functional as dice I am quite disappointed that I received pure colour dice when I ordered translucent ones. This would not be an issue if I had not paid about double the price just to get translucent dice to differentiate them from the bulk set I purchased for players in a game a am GMing. Any future purchasers be wary you may not get exactly what you order."
450,162,4," These are dice. They randomly generate numbers between one and twenty. If you want to randomly generate one of these numbers& you will do well with these."
451,162,3," Dice Arrived quickly and on time and are pretty nice looking die& unfortunately I misread the title and thought i was getting 5 sets of die instead of one& i would rate higher but with the added shipping costs it's a lot to pay for a single set of die."
452,162,5," Great little dice set for the money& although i think mine are broken as i cant seem to be able to roll above 10 on the D20 (maybe i'm just unlucky) they even arrived early! 11/10 would dice again"
453,162,4," Must make note that the colours shown are not the only possible colours& I got brown& but was delivered the first day of the expected delivery dates and no faults with paintwork of the dice."
454,162,4," Delivered in a decent time. Dice not great quality but they're good basic set. Nothing fancy."
455,163,3," Haven't popped or anything like that& so pretty robust for the price& but be warned& they do not look like these pictures.  These are clearly 'actual' dice& small plastic ones.  I could work that out for myself so wasn't expecting the blow up dice to look the same& but the blow up ones look as you might expect& with seams and convex 'faces' when they've been blown up.  However& for what I wanted them for (encouraging counting skills in young children) they are fine."
456,163,5," Great product exactly as described and arrived quicker than estimated. the picture is of normal deuce please don't expect them to look like than. however well packaged so fit through letterbox and i didn't have to pahff with going to the post office to collect. very happy"
457,163,5," These are absolutely perfect if you are throwing a casino theme party! Something for the kids to play with and they loved them. Blew up easily and stayed fully blown up for about 3 days."
458,164,4," This very inexpensive game is great fun when you have friends over& say after a meal and a few glasses of wine.  It's easy to play and everyone stays in the game 'til the very end."
459,164,5," This came right away& the dice look just as they should and clear.  Everything is held in a container which makes it super easy to transport.  The chips are smaller in size than I would like (i am not sure what the normal is though& only played this once before).  I am fine with that because we are going to use Dollar Bills while playing instead of the chips.  This is a fun game& it gets intense at the end.  Buy this and have fun with everyone!"
460,164,5," The product arrived next day as promised - excellent product& excellent service and excellent price!The game Left Centre Right is a new one to me and already I have had lots of fun playing this game!  Easy and FUN - glad I bought it!"
461,164,5," Excellent game to play with all ages.  Now play for pennies and strange game& because you can be 'ou' and then get back in and win! So simple& can teach in minutes. Excellent for large groups around the dinner table!"
462,164,5," Great family game forall ages& youngest player over Christmas was five and once he had worked out his left from his right no problem.  Also being so small you can put in pocket and use at any timereally enjoyable."
463,164,5," Quick and speedy delivery. Thanks. This is a great game for all the family from 3 to over 100 we take it on holiday for rainy days and end up with a Hugh group always playing. Great value for money."
464,164,5," Great game to take along anywhere as its so small.Good fun when there's 4 or 5 of you and the more the merrier.Games are short so no one gets bored.Would recommend highly."
465,164,5," Great simple game for all the family.  Everyone picked it up quickly and soon got competitive - a great way to pass the time and easy to take on holiday as so small."
466,165,4," This is a really great dice set& it even comes with a nice little box to put it in! I actually made a mistake& I thought these were 4th edition dice because I wasn't looking properly& but they're basically the same. These are alot better than expected."
467,165,4," Currently the dice don't come in the handy box pictured. This is mildly annoying& as the box makes a good dice-shaker. As for the dice themselves& they're fine& and very pretty too!"
468,166,5," Overview: These are a set of cubes which show a different image on each face. The aim of these are for the children to roll them and put them in order to make a sequence ready for a story. The child is then to use their imagination to create a story based on those characters& props and themes.Medic includes images of: wheelchair& person with a mask on& stethoscope& spotty sad face& needle& plasters& fan& sad face& broken bone etc.Uses: These are a fantastic resource to use in the classroom or at home. They come in a variety of styles which will suit different topics and children's interests. In the classroom they can be used individually with children or they could be used as a whole group with each child having a different image to add to the whole class story (e.g. sit in a circle and try to add a sequence to the running story). At home& or in the car journey they can be used to keep children amused and stimulated throughout.They are:> Compact& lightweight and durable.> Come in a lovely presentation box to keep them safe!> Have a different image on each face e.g a character& prop or themes/ideas.> Have a variety of themes to choose from e.g. other imagination ones and a new batman one has just been released.Would highly recommend to anyone who has children or works with them! They are fab!!!! Many hours of enjoymentActivity ideas:> Could be used to help develop EAL learners language recall. This may include rolling a dice and the children in the small EAL group need to say the key word as quick as possible. The first child to say it wins a point.> As a whole class each child could roll and dice and then one by one go around the room with each child adding an element to the story.Read more â€º"

472,167,4," Great idea& and excellent stocking filler.Feel that it's a shame it costs quite a bit for what it is and feel it should be cheaper would also then possibly appeal to more people for their children when it is such a great imagination builder!"
473,167,5," High quality durable product which is addictive to use and has some interesting variants."
474,167,5," Great game to play with Grandchildren"
475,168,5," A great game for all the family& Young children and adults& I especially like this game because it comes in a shaker that doubles as the games storage& also if you get Yhatzee score sheets you have two games in one x I think this is a fantastic travel game that is small and easy to transport wherever you go x even play alone to try and get the highest score you can xx"
476,168,5," I bought this as a gift for my 7 year old neices after they played with our set.  It is a great game& we played with my Granny who is 92 and everyone enjoyed it."
477,168,4," I bought this as a stocking filler gift for Christmas& so haven't used it yet.  We met a group of Americans on holiday this year who introduced us to this enjoyably simple game.  Looking forward to playing over the holidays."
478,169,5," Just what I wanted. Used for randomising our selection of home cocktails using my numbered 1000 recipe cocktail book!"
479,169,5," All as advertised and expected and they came quickly !"
480,170,5," Good fun."
481,171,4," Intrigued my 7 year old! Enjoyed showing trick to all his friends& easy to use."
482,172,5," It is 100 dice. One hundred Dice. I don't know how you can skimp on quality here& maybe I'd let 99 dice slip& but no& I got the full 100 and haven't lost one yet. Oh& I guess if you're expecting an even spread of colours then don't because these are entirely random& but who cares? Dice. 100 dice. It is literally 100 dice. They also come in more colours than the picture shows.100 Dice.Dice."
483,172,4," I bought these dice for use in whole class games.  I have often needed to buy sets of dice and have never found such a good price for good quality ones.  The range of colours makes it easy to divide them into sets and there are enough for a large class to use when participating in group activities."
484,172,4," I was inspired to buy a box of dice after attending a year one maths class with my son.  Having seen the kinds of things they do in class that involved touching& colours and repetition I thought having a mixed bag (literally) of dice would be a fun for all of us to use as counters for bingo& counting or even building games.  These dice are brightly coloured and feel like they will last for a long time.  I will always know where to go when one of the other board games is missing its dice !"
485,172,5," I got these dice for playing rpg's& board games and warhammer& they are great for all of these& keep in mind they are rather small& I like this as bigger dice are annoying when you have to roll lots of the at once but might not be for everyone& all you need to know about them other than that is that they are of amazing quality& all uniform size& nice array of colours& made to last"
486,172,4," I rate these 4 star not because of the quality or delivery& but because I was expecting them to be a bit bigger. They are good quality and exactly as described but they may be a little small for some people"
487,172,5," I bought these because children love small things and i thought they would be ideal for counting as they grow and colour sorting.They really are great solid little dice. The colours are a good variety and the kids love them for what they are. Little spotty cubes heheThese will serve us well in our house as the children grow. I like to make up games with the children so perfect. Thankyou"
488,172,4," For the cost of the thing I was very pleased.  I just needed some dice as my brother had gone off with mine and they never returned.  As it says in the title there were only 99 in the bag when I got it but hey& I only needed 20 or so anyway!I'd say it was a good purchase and would recommend it to anyone who runs a games club or plays a lot of roleplaying/table top battle games."
489,172,5," Lots of dice& all excellent quality of a level I would expect of a branded product. Quick delivery& nicely packaged. Used in a weekend gaming tournament with a lot of use and all are still in A1 condition. Any review from herein would only become surreal as there is not a lot you can say about dice. Excellent value for money."
490,173,4," If you didnt pick it up in the description there are no D6's (standard dice) in this pack& as long as you were aware then these are practical for gaming in every way& they are colour matched so each size die has its colour which will make gaming a little easier. Good quality standard poly dice."
491,173,5," They're dice& really& what do you expect of them?They neither explode on use nor do they sprout legs and walk about at night& perfectly ordinary well cast plastic dice& and exactly what I needed."
492,173,4," These 10 polyhedron dice consist of the following pairs:1 pair of tetrahedron (red)"
493,173,4," The dice are fairly standard and are good quality. Only comments I can make on them is that the 4 sided die is a number at top d4& rather than number at base. Not that this really matters. The other point is I would think the ideal set would dice of the same type in different colours so you can roll them simultaneously and have them mean different things eg with both d10 being the same colour it makes rolling them as 10s and 1s to generate 1-100 numbers problematic. However I knew that from the picture just suggesting a differnt ideal mix of the same dice. Also it would be nice to have 2 d6s for completeness."
494,173,5," This is a good set of dice& nice to have for home to replace all the cheap crappy ones supplied& they feel good in the hand and what else do you need :)"
495,173,4," In the product details it states |2 free six sided dice FREE by some suppliers| which is a tad confusing and might be better phrased a different way as I did not receive any D6& otherwise a perfectly reasonable product."
496,173,5," Set of x2 each of 4 / 8 / 10 / 12"
497,173,4," Normal dice have six sides. This is a set of dice with more than six sides. There are two dice of each type& four sided& eight sided& ten sided& twelve sided and twenty sided. The dice are well made and easy to read& that is why I like the dice and gave a rating of four stars. These dice are required for unusual games such as Dungeons and dragons."
498,174,5," My son (3.5y) loves playing with the game both alone and with us. He also enjoys just playing with the boards as a plane& train... My daughter (1.5y) also started to play with it by putting the shapes on the right place on the board."
499,174,4," This was purchased for a disabled person. As all Galt toys it is very robust"
500,175,5," Excellent items& i play magic with my daughters& they asked about getting the die& i looked on numerous sites and the prices they were charging was ridiculous& found these on Amazon& well worth the price& good quality."
501,175,5," Great set of dice. Perfect for wargames. Good quality dice."
502,176,5," Husband loved these good quality& unique gif for a dice collector. Great service"
503,176,5," Brilliant"
504,177,5," Superb game. Great components& and a much more accessible game than Race for the Galaxy. I love my copy of Race' and will be keeping it& but Roll For The Galaxy doesn't have the same massive barrier to entry& and can be taught to new payers in half the time.One or two of the tiles and have overly complex or unclear scoring systems& but generally things are well laid out& with rules written directly on the tiles instead of the cryptic iconography of Race'. Everyone has picked this up fully by the end of their first game& and been eager to immediately play a second."
505,177,5," Very colourful and well made.  Excellent and varied game play once you have learnt the rules.  Plenty of youtube videos to help."
506,177,5," Excellent game. Arrived in perfect condition."
507,178,5," Perfect for any role-playing enthusiast who wants a set of die which look great yet remain easy to read. Highly recommend this product."
508,178,5," Very lovely dice. Arrived in good time. Was a present for a friend and she really liked them. Would buy Q-Workshop dice again!"
509,178,5," Fantastic Dice& bought for playing D"
510,179,5," An expensive but nerdy necessity!"
511,180,5," Perfect game to take on holiday. I especially like the box it comes in. We were away with my parents and my children& the you gest is 5& and we played it every night. Also great to have in your bag and get out when the kids are board& a great alternative to the tablet!"
512,180,5," Love this game ! Have bought this as a gift for friends who have played it with us. Good entertainment& very quick and easy to learn and excellent to take away !"
513,180,4," It only got 4 stars because of it being a greag game for all ages. The tin is nice but buy the cheaper one and put your own counters in a cup whole you play!"
514,180,5," Not much to say really. Exactly as described& good quality& nicely presented in a metal tin.Very happy customer!"
515,180,5," A simple fun game for all ages ....can be played by small groups but can be best enjoyed by groups of eight or more people."
516,181,5," Stitching is sturdy& good quality& joints aren't glued& ready to fall to bits with age. The leather is raw& untreated / sealed& so it will develop a patina with handling"
517,181,5," nice quality&go well with the two old german dice cups i have had for years&quick delivery and  a very good price"
518,181,5," For years we had been using a German Kniffel cup which we'd had for too many year to remember& sadly the day came when it was no longer fit for purpose. We had bought a couple of other cups but found the quality was not what we'd been used to& until we chanced upon this one. Nicely sized& good quality leather& good stitching and looks like it will last for years to come."
519,181,5," Great dice cup& but cream was not my colour. As this is made of leather I took a dark tan boot polish and used this to change the colour to a dark wine. Now looks great. Very pleased ."
520,181,5," Received early. Greatly appreciated. Would visit you site again. Christmas is almost here so could be visiting sooner than later."
521,181,5," This shaker cup is ideal for our requirements as it is light and fits in a travel bag with next to no extra weight  good product"
522,181,5," Good quality dice cup& ensuring that the dice don't rattle when shaken.  A must for all dice games. Just the job."
523,181,4," Good product a little on the small side but does the job required"
524,182,4," These dice were a gift& and were very well received. However& some of the numbers are a little tricky to read and it took a while to work out the difference between the 9 and the 6. (The nine is the straighter one& which we didn't realise until we saw the 6)"
525,182,3," While these look like nice dice& I wouldn't recommend the clear version as they are quite hard to read. There where many situations where I couldn't tell the difference between a 4 and 14 at first glance which could be a fatal mistake while playing."
526,182,4," The dice look very nice and well made. Another d6 was also included with the 7-dice set which was a nice plus. I like the color and the font. One little problem is that few times is difficult to see the correct number immediately at a first glance."
527,182,5," Yes they were fab - a present and they were stoked about it"
528,183,5," I bought this game for my 3 year old son and he loves it. It's great for teaching him about sharing& understanding when it's someone else's turn and how to deal with losing& but it's also good fun. He loves it when the ship goes around the board (and so do I!) The game is easy to play and only lasts for 5-10 minutes or so& so can hold their attention and they don't get bored! Highly recommended for pirate fans and parents who want to be able to sit down with their children and introduce them to playing a good old fashioned board game!"
529,183,4," excellent toy& but the ship is a little flimsy as two of 3 masts were broken within a few days. i think this toy is for slightly older children who can look after it more carefully - 3 and 5 yo did not do it justice"
530,183,1," I was disappointed because the board on which the game was played came in 4 pieces and when put together like a jigsaw puzzle was too uneven to accommodate the pirate ship's movement around the board."
531,184,5," Georgeous dice& a little hard to read despite the fact that they are not entirely transparent& especially in dim light but I use them a lot. They are also extremely sturdy. How did I find this out? Well& I was peeling potatoes and my D6 must have fallen in& because when I was draining them after cooking the dice was there& completely unharmed& just slight foggier than the other ones."
532,184,5," A pretty set of dice. They made a nice present."
533,184,3," well made dice& came relatively quickly& but they say that they are clear but they are bit cloudy and sort of a yellowish colour"
534,185,3," The dice have a nice feel to them and look good& however the paint work is not good on at least half of the dice I received. I managed to find two that were fine which are being used& but I expected all of them to be quality tested."
535,185,5," Good quality dice with a nice weight."
536,185,5," Quick delivery& does the job."
537,186,4," Nice dice if you want something a little different but not too busy and unreadable.However I find that the 2s look like 7s while upside down& a bit annoying but it could be that I just need to get used to a new font."
538,186,4," I like the colour& but it isn't clear as pictured& it is translucent pink. other than that& well made dice."
539,186,5," Dice are dicey and readable."
540,187,5," Overview: These are a set of cubes which show a different image on each face. The aim of these are for the children to roll them and put them in order to make a sequence ready for a story. The child is then to use their imagination to create a story based on those characters& props and themes.Fright includes images of: monster opening a door& hand coming out of the soil& spider& skull& clown etcUses: These are a fantastic resource to use in the classroom or at home. They come in a variety of styles which will suit different topics and children's interests. In the classroom they can be used individually with children or they could be used as a whole group with each child having a different image to add to the whole class story (e.g. sit in a circle and try to add a sequence to the running story). At home& or in the car journey they can be used to keep children amused and stimulated throughout.They are:> Compact& lightweight and durable.> Come in a lovely presentation box to keep them safe!> Have a different image on each face e.g a character& prop or themes/ideas.> Have a variety of themes to choose from e.g. other imagination ones and a new batman one has just been released.Would highly recommend to anyone who has children or works with them! They are fab!!!! Many hours of enjoymentActivity ideas:> Could be used to help develop EAL learners language recall. This may include rolling a dice and the children in the small EAL group need to say the key word as quick as possible. The first child to say it wins a point.> As a whole class each child could roll and dice and then one by one go around the room with each child adding an element to the story.Read more â€º"
541,187,4," Bought it for my 7 years old grandson& who loves made up stories.  Found a couple of the pictures a bit challenging to 'read'& but my grandson enjoyed it."
542,187,5," Tiny!!"
543,188,5," These dice look amazing - I love dragons. I'm thinking about buying the White and Black set too. These came from Poland and STILL managed to arrive before the predicted delivery time."
544,188,5," A well made set of dice with a lovely design."
545,189,5," Ordered these expecting much larger dice& My happy mistake.Turns out they are great for use as hit point counters for my Warhammer Hq's"
546,189,5," Exactly what I needed to keep track of wounds/hit points when war gaming.Small enough size to fit on model bases or vehicles and different enough size not to be confused with normal gaming dice!"
547,189,5," Tiny dice as expected. Perfect for arts and crafts or if ur like me good as counters in magic the gathering for creatures and enchantments.Some of the numbers are a bit squiffy with paint overlapping the dots but for the price you can't beat it. Especially as the bags I got all had either 103 or 105."
548,189,4," I use these dice when I'm playing games where I need to roll A LOT of dice at the same time& as 7mm dice are small and easy to manage.7mm dice are about 1/8th the size of regular playing dice."
549,190,4," I picked these up to have a 'better quality' set of dice compared to those that came with the D"
550,190,4," Generally Chessex dice seem to be pretty well made& but you need to watch out for getting a bad set& a lot of people seem to be reporting dice that are flawed with things like missing marks between the 6 and 9 on the D20.They're wonderful dice& but if you get a bad set& report it.  Personally I think it's a better idea to just go out and find a store that sells sets of them already so you know what you're getting on hand."
551,190,5," Great dice& good quality and really easy to read even in darkened rooms. very happy"
552,191,5," Really lovely dice."
553,192,5," Well made wooden game. Have played many times with my daughter who loves flipping down the animals. Good for learning colours and animals. Much better to travel with as there is a spinner (no dice to loose) :) Sometimes takes a while for someone to win but itâ€™s still good fun spinning the wheel until you do"
554,193,5," Beautiful dice& a little hard to read but they make up for that by being extremely lucky. I kid you not& I used these as my GM dice and in my first ever session I rolled 12 natural 20's and a grand total of one natural one& which since has been the only one."
555,193,5," As always - love Q-Workshop dice!"
556,194,5," Bought this as addition to my order of Runic D"
557,194,5," nice little bag.too big for the dice sets thoughgood quality"
558,194,5," My Son was thrilled& said they were exactly right!"
559,194,5," It's a bag that holds dice.11/10"
560,195,5," very nice set of dice and easy to read"
561,196,5," They are as beautiful as I first laid eyes upon them& I suppose the only real issue is the eldritch horrors that came with it... if only I knew then what I know now..."
562,196,5," These are now my favourite dice. I love them. They look like they are pictured and they are just fantastic. Ekki ekki ptang and so on :D"
563,196,5," Lovely dice& arrived in good time and have decent results in rolls."
564,196,5," This product came through ahead of time and was in great quality upon arrival& fantastic service on all fronts.Now for me to begin my decent into paperback role-playing geekdom."
565,196,5," I Thought they were suposed to glow in the dark& but I checked the description and didn't find anything like it& so I must have looked wrong. Otherwise they are exactly what I expected."
566,196,4," Very nice dice& roll well. Only complaint is that the D4 doesnt have the same star symbol on the 4 that all the other dice do& making it a bit disconnected with the rest of the set"
567,196,3," Good Set of Dice but Very Difficult to read due to the Green And Black being very close to merging.. might have been better with red"
568,197,5," This is one beautiful object.  If you're a fan of role -playing games or just love throwing dice you won't be disappointed.  My only surprise& and it was a pleasant one was that it is larger than I expected and it has a satisfying weightiness to it. The engraved patterns are sharp and the 'inking' of the lines is solid with no gaps or 'blurry' bits. I had occasion to correspond with the company and found their customer support excellent. I shall definitely be purchasing again from this company. Highly recommended"
569,197,5," Big& easy to see what numbers are facing up& good weight to it& I use this for MTG& so as a life counter it's great& I can't comment on any other use."
570,197,5," Very nice design& great looking& but it is far bigger than I've expected& rather not for usual board game play& but might work for RPG session."
571,198,3," Purchased from LTZmart.  Ordered on 2 Aug and arrived from China on 15 Aug.  The cubes are square& but the print is smudged and not always located in the middle of the cube face.  Lots of excess ink that's also been dripped onto dice.  My set contains 2 blue& 2 green& 2 yellow& 2 red& 2 pink and 2 orange dice.  They'll be fine for school and at Â£3 coming from China& it's hard to complain& but if you want a well produced product& this isn't it."
572,198,4," Bought these as I was getting some outdoor games for my 5"
573,198,5," I ordered the dice to use in the classroom and they have really worked a treat.  There is many ways to use this and embed functional skills maths into lessons. Foam is great as they are not going to be thrown and cause injury!!"
574,198,5," Pleased with this order because my 3 year old is learning to count&and the colours are very bright and fun to play pre-school counting games with."
575,198,5," I work in a school and I bought these because the sound of the plastic dice against the table was driving me mad and these are nice and silent."
576,198,4," Perfect for what I needed. They have many uses and my colleagues have borrowed them too! Will use this site agian for more educational ideas."
577,198,5," They are light& a good size and what I expected. There isn't much more I can say about them& they are dice!"
578,198,5," My students love them... I already |lost| two of them after my clasess...."
579,199,5," Great product and very good delivery. Quality dice."
580,200,5," Box of 120 Deluxe Gaming ChipsI don't really consider these to be a toy. I bought them for my grown up son to use when he and his mates have a poker night. I'm sure they will give many years of good service. The chips are well made and have a good feel."
581,200,5," Superb poker chips& really pleased with them. Quality is really nice with a nice proper chips finish and a really heavy feel. arrived quicker than it thought in time for my games night which actually made me money. So if you think about it they are free"
582,201,5," Beautifully crafted item.  The box is well made and the dice are a nice weighty size and they roll really well."
583,201,4," Qwik service & no problems."
584,202,5," My son hates maths so I bought demon dice as an attempt to get him to enjoy the subject& and he loves it!  It's such a simple concept - throw the dice and do the sums& you keep adding together your scores and whoever has the highest score when a player throws an |Ahhhhhhh| wins a demon figure.  We play it as the best of 3 rounds.  It's given him confidence in his maths skills and it has a handy carry pouch so he often just takes it out with him in case he gets bored wherever we are."
585,202,5," Nice little game to play quickly whilst learning at the same time. Would recommend and improves maths skills and mental arithmetic.."
586,202,4," The 9 year old recipient liked this game and gave it four stars. He enjoyed playing it with his older brother& but commented that he couldn't use it with his younger siblings. That&of course& is not the fault of the game."
587,202,5," Its been to restaurants and on holiday with us. Easy to pack easy to play. My daughters maths teacher was impressed when she took it into school too. Well worth the money."
588,202,5," Brilliant fun game that has no complicated rules. Kids are learning whilst having fun& parents happy to join in too"
589,202,5," I had expected the novelty to wear off a bit and it has but this is still a fun game for my 7 year old."
590,202,4," A great game to play& with different variations& thanks to the symbols on the dice."
591,202,4," I gave it to a 7-year old as a present and he seemed to like it.  It looked good to me."
592,203,5," We bought this game for our 6 year-old and 4 year-old girls and we just love it. We like to play it because it is easy and each game does not take too long.The pictures on the dice are nice and clear and the notepad is very easy to use and understand as there is no writing.The box to keep everything in order is in metal& very clever!Very good game for the whole family& as adults will enjoy it too!"
593,203,5," One of our family favourite game for 2 years now. Good for age 4+"
594,204,3," I play this with my nearly 7 year old and he can play reasonably well so it is not that difficult to grasp.  Games last between 5-15 minutes maximum and you can play 4 or 5 games before getting a bit bored.As you roll the dice each time you start the game no two games are alike& it is just that the game play is a little simple.  It is more akin to draughts than chess in terms of strategy and speed."
595,204,5," This should have been my favourite of all the games I possess in my collection (around 700) as it consists of nothing but dice - which I love"
596,204,4," This was bought as a gift as it looked like it could be a good game. The recipient enjoys chess"
597,204,4," Both my 7 and 9 enjoy playing this game. I wasn't sure what to expect at such a great price but both kids love playing it. It's a mix between chess and draughts - easier for my two to master and doesn't cause as many arguments!"
598,204,5," Very happy with my purchase the game is sealed and unopened no damage to the box . It arrived really quickly . I've actually ordered another one as a Christmas gift ."
599,205,5," Amazing quality item worth every penny. Bought as gift for my significant other and one of a different design for myself. Delighted with both and excellent service from Q-workshop."
600,206,5," Very pleased with the Dice"
601,206,4," Generally Chessex dice seem to be pretty well made& but you need to watch out for getting a bad set& a lot of people seem to be reporting dice that are flawed with things like missing marks between the 6 and 9 on the D20.They're wonderful dice& but if you get a bad set& report it.  Personally I think it's a better idea to just go out and find a store that sells sets of them already so you know what you're getting on hand."
602,206,5," Used them on the day I got them. Exactly what I was after. The colours are sharply contrasting& which is why I bought them& and the numbers are easy to read."
603,207,5," 10 minutes to defuse a tonne of bombs before your ship blows up! Well. What a game! What boils down to just rolling dice and matching them to a few cards which represent bombs managed to capture my game groups imagination and set pulses racing as we all worked together to defuse the bombs. You have 10 minutes to do this and time ticks down in realtime& the dice are argued over as you try to defuse the last few bombs...will you make the right choices or will it all go up in flames. Buy it& you will have a blast."
604,207,5," Fuse is a game about disarming bombs using dice. The concept is similar to Elder Sign& Age of War or Roll for It& in that the 'bombs' are card with requirements on that you must match with dice.To set up you lay a certain number of bombs in front of each player (depending on player count) and a joint pool of bombs in the middle. You will then shuffle six fuse cards into the deck and you are ready to go. The first player will take a number of dice (again on player count) from the bag and roll them. Each player must then match one of these dice to a symbol on their card& this could be as simple as the colour or number on the dice& but also can be stacks or pyramids which must be in a certain order. For example you may have to have a stack where each number is numerically more than the last. Once a card is cleared you draw from the shared pool to your bombs& replace the shared card from the deck& resolve any fuse cards that appear& and return diffused dice to the bag. If you don't use all the dice in any one round they must be rerolled and each player loses a die from their bombs of that colour or number if possible.You have 10 minutes to finish which is best monitored with a free app which really adds to the tension. I really like this game. It is hard& and frantic but an awful lot of fun and only takes 10 minutes& it plays 1-5 people with minor adjustments for 1 or 2 players. It can be made harder if you start finding it easy by adding more bombs in and there are a number of super hard bombs you can add in too.The components are brilliant and the symbology on the cards makes sense after one game. This will stay in my collection."
605,208,2," These dice look and feel like casino dice& that is true. But what I understood by 'Casino Quality Dice' was perfect or precision dice& which these are not.If you are looking for 'perfect' or 'precision' dice& this is not the product for you. However& if you are just looking for casino-like dice with a good look and feel& this is for you!"
606,208,1," I had some casino style dice with a set of poker chips and over the years they have all been lost except for one. So I thought getting a new set would be nice. These are nothing like the picture. I got 10 cheap faded red dice with iffy white dots as opposed to the 5 clear shiny casino style dice that are pictured. I should avoid like the plague."
607,208,1," Nothing like advertised in words nor in the picture. The color is wired faded opaque red-like color& and not clear bright red as pictured. Also& the dice are very large (or should I say huge!) and it's hard to hold more than two in one hand and are not as smooth as casino dice should be. In short& nothing like Casino Quality dice. In addition& I was two dice short of what I ordered didn't bother call the sender& since these dice are so poorly made& I doubt it if I ever use them. Go look for other dice& those are highly disappointing."
608,208,1," Delivery was okay but thought they would of been here quicker as only dice. When they came the quality wasn't all that as corners damaged and white dots faded. But as they say you get what you pay for and they were cheap."
609,208,5," These dice seem good value for money and they look and feel as if they are of good quality. Having lost the dice in just about evey family game we have had over the years& it is good to find some decent replacements at such a reasonable price.  I wouldn't know if they are casino quality& but for family games they are fine&"
610,208,5," awesome dice. Feel nice in your hands and they have a gorgeous clear red and white finish to them.HOURS of fun have been had and will be had with these"
611,208,4," I bought these dice to play Yahtzee with and number games with the children& we love the bright red colour."
612,208,5," Good value dice. Not real casino quality& but then I'm not running a casino."
613,209,3," Smaller than I imagined but perfect for Yatzee dice! The box had a large sticker on one side which didn't peel off well ( I ended up scrubbing it off and re-polishing it) and I never intended to use the dice provided but they weren't easy to read and didn't seems as nice as the box itself. Overall& its good for the price but not as pretty as the picture!"
614,209,4," It's not the greatest quality but then it wasn't expected to be at the price. The dots that were meant to make the box look like a dice were not in the correct place so instead of giving this as part of a gift as we had intended& we kept it as a spare set of dice for the kids."
615,209,5," These dice come in a very attractive box. The quality really is excellent given the low price. Why this proct is described as a toy is beyond me!If you are looking for some attractive wooden dice then look no further. Excellent value for money!"
616,209,5," Amazing value& we use these for backgammon& they are exactly as the picture portrays them"
617,210,5," Got it for my 7 year old grandson.  A fun way to encourage that age group with arithmetic. Reasonably priced and easy to slip in to a pocket or backpack to play on a journey."
618,210,5," Fun little game& perfect for travel (or e.g. when eating out) as it's easy to slip in your bag. Definitely a fun way to reinforce times tables/number work without it being obvious learning. Think I'll be buying Level 2 for a Christmas present!"
619,210,5," Bought this for our 6 year old grandson& who is mad about maths and numbers& and he loves it.  Had to be played several times over Christmas.  It is also a good practice for his sister who is not so good at Maths. A successful gift."
620,210,5," Fantastic learning game for kids."
621,210,5," Bought this as a present for 6yr old& great little game."
622,210,1," The game came without instructions and& despite trying valiantly to get them from the supplier& I ended up researching the game on the internet and writing my own for my grandson."
623,210,5," Bought this for our 6 year old to play on holiday and he loves it. The pack is small enough to fit in a large pocket or in a handbag. We play with two or three players."
624,210,5," Really fantastic helped my son (5) get interested in maths at last!"
625,211,5," I use these to create random numbers to create truly random passwords. They do their part excellently. With hindsight& perhaps I should have ordered 5 dice of different colours. ."
626,211,5," Bought these because I needed a couple of extra D10s for gaming and at the price these were sold for (less than Â£2)& I decided that I might as well get a packet of five rather than paying more for fewer dice.They work the way they are supposed to and I guess that I could always use them for making one time pads (OTPs) if I ever decide that I needed secure ways of communicating& or just decided to dress up as a KGB agent for Halloween but in a really hardcore way."
627,211,4," The dice shown are exactly what I ordered. Cheap and Cheerful product. Cheaper than what I could find on the high street. The dice are nice and bold in colour. Being used for life counters. Going to buy more in other colours!"
628,211,5," As expected very good quality dice& just as a heads up& their faces are 0-9 rather than 1-10 which is what I wanted& but doesn't make much difference to be honest."
629,212,5," The dice have a good weight and a ceramic feel - The designs on the faces are clear and each die is identical (believe it or not I have bought poker dice that weren't) - Very pleased with the purchase"
630,212,3," It's probably harsh to downrate these& but...  They aren't as big as i was hoping.  They are ordinary sized dice - 15mm across each face.  I was expecting larger& 25mm& as these are the only poker dice I have seen before.  The size is not specified anywhere (that I can see!) so I haven't been misled.  Just disappointed.  But they are great quality and arrived very swiftly& and i will keep and enjoy them."
631,212,5," I bought this set as it looks durable and is nicely made. I like card and dice games."
632,212,5," Bought 2 packs as there such a good price&not bad quality either. Arrived within 3 days what more can you ask for!"
633,212,5," This was a great game for Christmas afternoon - my Dad and I taught it to my sister and while we didn't play for money it was still great& quick and competitive."
634,212,5," This is a superb game.Played a lot in Norwich pubs in my youth.I recommend a leather throwing cup a felt lined box  to make game complete."
635,212,5," Nice quality&very pleased&fast delivery&would recommend&but don't no why all these red lines are under my writing&i think all words arespelt correctly&??????"
636,212,5," These dice are a lot of fun for the small price charged& They seem to be of quite reasonable quality& and arrived within a few days of the order being placed. I would however not advise anyone to play for money with this sort of thing& it's easier and far less expensive to just play for 'points lost' ie lose a point everytime you  get caught out in a lie."
637,213,3," I'm giving them three stars mostly cause it's expected& unbalanced dice have their uses and cause they look as pretty as in the picture.But that's about it& they are pretty& but as expected from Chessex and other cheap dice makers& they reign from slightly to woefully unbalanced. Your mileage may vary in this aspect.Otherwise the box the dice came in is somewhat brittle tho that may be of little concern if you got your own dice bag/box.On the other hand& the numbers are very easily read and they look very pretty& good show-off dice."
638,213,5," These die are awesome!  The colour is great.  I am very pleased with them :)There are some small parts on the corners that have been caught& but they are barely noticeable and only if you are truly OCD will you realise.The colour is amazing and they look brilliant in the light.I would definitely get these again."
639,213,4," Easily the prettiest dice I own. The numbers are easy to read and haven't faded at all (after several months of use and being carried around everyday)Only thing stoping it being five star? I wish they were the life counter style. Then they really would be perfect."
640,213,1," Got the dice in good time hence the 1 star but there are chipped and battered at the edges and random scratches over them. Clearly 2nd/3rd hand& do not trust these. They are a rip off."
641,213,5," If everyday life choices were influenced by the roll of a dice these are the dice I'd use. Going to work today? Roll a d20!... Perhaps the only time you'd want luck to be against you."
642,213,3," Awesome dice& paintwork and engravings are on point. However& at some of the edges and corners there are scuffs which are visible and rough& despite this I still like this dice set."
643,214,5," Excellent game for children of all ages. They love the | gamble| aspect when they have to decide whether to stick or take a chance on a second throw and I like that they are strengthening their mental arithmetic skills."
644,214,5," Great dice game for all the family& very good for helping my 7 year old with addition of hundreds and thousands. East to pick up and can be played without the official score sheets once they have been used up.Simple rules& each roll of the dice the player picks a combination of dice to score the highest points& they can then choose to roll again for more points but risk losing the ones already accumulated or bank their points and let the next player have their turn.Highly recommend"
645,214,5," Great game for all ages& my kids love this and it's great for a large number of people too. No real skill required just nerves and luck."
646,214,5," great fun& I will order another for a gift. The item came from America but arrived by estimated delivery day."
647,215,5," arguably not as shiny as shown in the picture. nevertheless looks really fantastic!"
648,216,5," They helped me kill the final boss in my first Savage Worlds game& 10/10 would stab Anathraxa again."
649,216,4," Nice colours& but the dice feel a bit plastic and they need more weight in them."
650,216,5," They look great."
651,217,5," Great packaging and awesome simple game. So simple to play but so much fun!! 40 dice and a lot of variations - it really is fun just throwing dice down in  a race with adults and kids alike. I love it."
652,217,5," I played it at christmas and now played it with family. Like the way its easy to take with you also simple to get to understand and all family liked it. Can be played in teams with more people great buy."
653,217,5," This game provided endless fun at Christmas and since& for the whole family. It's so simple to play and doesn't require a lot of space to play."
654,217,5," Great game! Simple to play but lots of fun for adults as well as children. The kids play for hours - and it gets them away from their screens!"
655,217,5," Fantastic family game"
656,217,5," Really cool game.  Even the stroppy teenagers liked it."
657,217,5," Great game. Lots of family fun"
658,218,5," really enjoying this maths toy"
659,218,4," Looks as described"
660,219,4," Gorgeous dice& they roll really well. The only reason this isn't a five star review is because a few of the dice have chips/flaws& unfortunately (I read the other customer reviews and hoped my set wouldn't be afflicted& but alas)& but nothing so bad that it affects the rolls."
661,220,5," very nice dice"
662,221,5," This is a great little set of dice and plastic counters. The set I received included yellow counters. The plastic tube is quite robust and the whole thing is no bigger than a tube of smarties. Each of the three dice have 1 side with an L& 1 with a C& 1 with an R and 3 with a single dot.The game is very simple. You start with three counters for each player and throw the three dice in turn. The letters are the direction in which you must pass a 'coin'& to the person on your left or right and C going to the 'bank' in the centre. But where you throw a dot& you get to keep that number of coins.When your next turn arrives& if you have three or more coins then you throw all three dice& if you have two coins then you only throw two dice& or indeed one if you have only one coin left. The game continues until only one person is left with any coins and they then win all the banked coins.Jackpot!Instructions are included but if you've read this far& you already know exactly how to play!We were introduced to this game whilst visiting family on holiday in Ireland and we played with three 5 (euro) cent coins each. My 5 and 7 year olds were facinated by it and wanted to keep playing. The great thing is the game doesn't last too long - with 6 people& about 10 minutes per game. We played three games before the kids bedtime and it was just enough for us all.The gameplay is engaging and crucially you get to communicate and have a good laugh together. It's a great way of enjoying the company of others.It's a really inexpensive game and slips into your pocket or hand luggage if you're travelling. A good all-round buy and highly recommended!"
663,221,5," This is so simple yet it has the excitement of |GAMBLING|! We play it starting with 10 pennies each. We don't put out the player with no pennies& we let them wait in& not throwing the dice& but they'll get a penny passed from left or right eventually - and might win in the end! Age range in our game = 5/6 years to 84. Age 5 learnt left from right. I recommend it to get a group like this to laugh together."
664,221,1," Bought as a stocking filler for my 4 and 7 year old and am very disappointed!The game is cheap enough and I bought it on the back of reading such positive reviews.I'm not sure if its that my kids enjoy games ranging from pairs and top trumps to rumikub& qwixx& sequence and yatzee but this game is beyond boring! There is no skill involved and my kids (who have good attention spans) were uninterested after the first game we played.Only positive I found was that it encourages kids to learn left and right.Not sure what I'm missing!"
665,221,5," This game is so simple but brilliant to play for all ages.... it definitely creates fun and entertainment and for the price is a bargain. I have played it with many friends and family and they have all brought one for themselves. Its very small to carry around so a great game to take on holiday or when you are out and about to entertain the kids. Arrived quickly& recommend seller."
666,221,5," A simple concept of a game that all can play from (say) five and upwards. The game can be played with the supplied counters& but more fun is had by playing for 5 or 10p coins"
667,221,5," This is a simple game - trying to explain it would not do it justice. It sounds dull - rolling the dice and moving the counters either left& right or centre - but weirdly& in a group of adults and kids& it really is enjoyable. I play it with the grandparents and my 4 and 6 year olds and we all have fun. It's innocent& old fashioned& anti-television entertainment!"
668,221,5," This is such a simple game and good for children to teach them right and left. However& I also bought this as a game for adults to play at Christmas. We play with 1p coins instead of the tokens! You need quite a few people to make it more fun but it can wipe you out of your pennies quite quickly if play a few rounds! Good fun though."
669,221,4," This is really good fun to play!  Our version of the game is normally played with at least four adults and the counters are replaced by 10p or 20p pieces& so there's a pot of money to be won each round of the game.  It's a very simple game of luck& where no skill is required.  I think it's over-priced& but would still recommend it."
670,222,5," A nice little gadget for all sorts of occasions. It's use can be varied& from simply telling a story to creating a group story or even acting it out. It's a fun toy for kids and a handy tool for anyone working with kids (or teenagers)& such as Drama teachers. I've used it for both simply having some fun with it and working with individuals and groups and am loving it. It's a set of unlimited possibilities& games and stories that fit into a pocket. Easy."
671,222,5," We've had great fun with these Cubes. We got a set for our 6 year old to distract him on a long journey. The images are cleverly designed so that they can be interpreted in different ways. He was captivated by them and he still gets them out when he friends come round. It's so sweet to hear them tell stories together. Good too for adults over a glass or two - although the stories tend to be a bit different! Highly recommended."
672,222,4," We bought this for our 6 year old son. He understood the concept very quickly and enjoys playing. There are 9 dice& in a nice box& so very easy to take anywhere. Limited by child's vocabulary and experiences - but good for encouraging creative thinking and discussion."
673,222,5," Overview: These are a set of cubes which show a different image on each face. The aim of these are for the children to roll them and put them in order to make a sequence ready for a story. The child is then to use their imagination to create a story based on those characters& props and themes.The images include: house& tower& water fountain& balloon& lightening bolt& rainbow& torch& aeroplane& earth& bridges& bee& dice& turtle& eye& clock& key& masks& hands& padlock& balancing beam& compass& moon& speech bubble& stick& tent& fish& lightbulb& sheep etc.Uses: These are a fantastic resource to use in the classroom or at home. They come in a variety of styles which will suit different topics and children's interests. In the classroom they can be used individually with children or they could be used as a whole group with each child having a different image to add to the whole class story (e.g. sit in a circle and try to add a sequence to the running story). At home& or in the car journey they can be used to keep children amused and stimulated throughout.They are:> Compact& lightweight and durable.> Come in a lovely presentation box to keep them safe!> Have a different image on each face e.g a character& prop or themes/ideas.> Have a variety of themes to choose from e.g. other imagination ones and a new batman one has just been released.Would highly recommend to anyone who has children or works with them! They are fab!!!! Many hours of enjoymentActivity ideas:> Could be used to help develop EAL learners language recall. This may include rolling a dice and the children in the small EAL group need to say the key word as quick as possible. The first child to say it wins a point.Read more â€º"
674,222,5," 9 cubes& each with an individual picture of all sides& creating a unique story on each throw.We bought this as |not sure what to buy| for a niece and nephew (age 6 and 3) for xmas& not thinkng for one minute how much fun it would be! Our daughter of 10 was so envious of it we then ordered her one too. We took ours on holiday over the xmas period. Out of all the electronic gizmo's our daughter took with her this game kept her amused the most& which was very refreshing when we live in a world of technology! It really made her use her imagination. We all took it in turns to create the next adventure of the story. She would write out the next chapter to the stories too. We had so much fun listening to the adventures!It is absolutley brilliant& really gets you thinking and rather addictive. And completely broadened our 10 years vocabulary and imagintion. Its small enough to pop into handbag too which meant we could use it the plane& car journey& restaurants etc etc.I totally recommend this product for all ages. Really good fun. The Creativity Hub Rory's Story Cubes"
675,222,5," excellent product which really stimulates the imagination. I use it for creative writing classes with children as part of my work.  Really sparks  ideas and is a great fun item."
676,222,5," Rory's story cubes were purchased on a recommendation from the Guardian newspaper& and how right they were! Such a simple idea that anybody can play. My daughter hasn't put them down since getting them and she even carries them in her handbag- ideal when out for a meal with Grandparents! I have been recommending them to everybody!"
677,222,5," What a great toy!  I bought the cubes for my 4"
678,223,5," Very pleased with the Dice"
679,224,5," Very pleased with the Dice"
680,224,5," I got these dice to play pathfinder with they came in a nice box and I love them. they are what I wanted& I also got orange and blak ones"
681,225,5," My 7 year old grandaughter loves making up and writing stories.  She rolls the dice and makes a story up that include all 9 element.  She absolutely loves this and even helps her 3 year old brother make his own stories.  Great for imagination and developing verbal and writing skills."
682,225,5," This present& although for a Granddaughter& captured everyone's imagination. It is excellent for keeping children amused for hours and can only be a help in increasing their word power and how to make up stories."
683,225,5," I love them. They were bought for me as a present and I have renewed my writing ability and imagination at the age of 50. You get 9 cubes and the idea is to write a story using the pictures as they fall. I often only use 3 dice and write a really short 300-500 word story or a bit of prose. Extend your imagination by taking 1 dice and when the picture comes up do not take it at face value. Write down all the things the picture COULD represent& not just the obvious& e.g. the lightning cube could be lightning& speach bubble& ghost& fir tree etc etc. Let your mind wander."
684,225,5," The cubes were bought for my first Grandaughter at the age of one&even though not old enough to hold them we still make up stories.Bought as a handbag emergency kit they are perfect for entertaining any age&all you need to add is a little imagination.Used them on a plane&ferry and in the car also good at picnics for adults and children alike.These are just fab."
685,225,5," great for making stories and small enough to carry in a bag when out at dinner for quiet entertainment"
686,225,5," What a wonderful concept.  Can't wait to watch my granddaughter and family playing!"
687,226,4," They are what they say they are& simply a nice clear set of Dice. I got them to replace my lost set of Dice for Yahtzee& but they are perfect for any board game."
688,226,5," I work in a Pre School& I purchased this pack of dice along with the different shaped dice pack for Maths resource. Good value (as the children seem to loose dice very easily)."
689,226,4," The dice sold here are of optimal size and perfect for games& maths and other purposes. Enough in a pack to ensure that if 1 gets lost you still have 9 left. Good value."
690,226,4," Does what they do they work they rattle they roll and they have numbers and they are square and have dots on"
691,226,4," handy pack of dice. just the thing to have around incase you lose dice from your other games"
692,226,5," These were a very reasonable price and arrived quickly. I'm using them to help a child struggling with maths and they work really well."
693,226,5," dice very white and well made at a very good price use them every saturday night when playing backgammon they roll a treat"
694,226,5," I wanted a good set of dice for all games and this fits the bill perfectly. I've never bought dice so I hoped that these were the ones that I remembered from my childhood and& indeed& they were. Perfect size and good quality at a price you'd expect. The packaging was perfectly adequate which allowed them to be posted through my letter box and the item arrived promptly. Thanks."
695,227,4," There's not a great deal that can be said for sleeves& but i've purchased about 10 of these and keep going back when i need more. EAsy to sleeve& perfect fit for your MTG cards& and have kept them in good condiion."
696,227,5," Perfect for double sleeving standard sized CCG or boardgame cards. Place these sleeves upside down around the card before inserting normally into a standard game card sleeve - for example Fantasy Flight Games silver sleeves.Double sleeving offers better protection from dust& grit and particularly moisture - which can cause a foil card to warp.Not recommended for use as a sleeve on its own."
697,227,5," Brought this to protect my A.NR cards. Fits perfectly."
698,227,5," I love these sleeves& they fit my Magic: the gathering cards perfectly"
699,227,5," Arrived days earlier than expected and they are a prefect fit just as described."
700,227,5," I used these for sleeving Exploding Kittens& good quality and a perfect fit! And can even sleeve them into the standard card size (for double protection) but I'm happy enough just as they are. So happy& that I've bought another pack!"
701,227,4," These are VERY tight. However for magic players they might be a little thin and slippery. For me& using them for smash up& they were perfect."
702,227,5," perfect for inner sleeves"
703,228,5," Very good game well made well satisfied"
704,229,5," Nice quality and dices come with a neat box for carrying."
705,230,5," Great little box of matching items....such as& a vase and flowers& a teapot and teacup& socks and shoes etc. Played this alot since we bought it for my 3yr old...good buy"
706,230,5," it is an educational game& which I like& plus trains the child memory&and the cards a pretty thick& which is very good!"
707,230,5," I love this memory game - it is timeless& since it is not connected to any current children's characters.  It has the extra twist of not just matching exact pairs but items that go together e.g. toothpaste and tooth brush& bucket and spade etc.  Good value for money."
708,231,5," Wonderful quality dice& as can be expected from chessex. They arrived earlier than predicted& and for a high quality set of dice the price is reasonable. I would highly recommend that you buy them if you have a chessex dice set missing from your dice bag."
709,232,4," Just right for Halma board so can get grandchildren introduced to this and other board games needing |counters| or |pawns|"
710,233,5,""
711,233,4," I got a free sample of this to review.The packaging it comes in is nice& though I did notice that everything in the box could easily have fit into something less than half the size. I am not a big fan of boxes too big for the contents& but at least the box looks nice& something moving about inside it will make it more exciting before unwrapping it as a gift& and so it's not all bad.Inside are the three different colours of sand and some moulds to play with& moulds that could of course just as easily be used with regular sand or other things.The play sand doesn't really feel like sand& but like a cross between saw dust and plasticine& not an entirely unpleasant feeling& really& and they are easy to work with& crumbling like sand sometimes& and sticking together like plasticine when you compress them properly.Using one of the moulds& the shape held rather well& though it did collapse a little bit on one of the ridges on the side. Still& an impressive result& I think& for something like this.After using it& there was a little bit of sand dust that I'd not managed to get back in the bag& but whatever causes the sand to stick together doesn't feel as if it leaves any residue on neither hands or work surface. Another good result& I think.Had I still been a child& I would have thought this was great fun â€“ well& I still think it's great fun& to be honest. It is something that has a lot of potential for creativity while avoiding being too messy."
712,233,4," My daughters (aged 8"
713,233,5," Disclaimer: I received this product for a discount in exchange for an unbiased review.The packaging is quite large and colourful â€“ but I would say slightly generous with its claims for the product inside. The box is a bit bigger than it needs to be to hold three light packs of play sand& three (green& for me) moulds and a container which for me was actually an almost broken plastic tray which got pushed aside and replaced straight away.The coloured play sand itself is a fun gift for any young child â€“ with three reasonably sized packs of yellow& green and pink sand enough to keep kids entertained for a while. The different coloured sands inevitably mix together but thatâ€™s to be expected and surprisingly& any mess on the floor or surfaces are easy to clean off. The sand is easy to mould and manipulate as it is soft and sticky& but not to the level that itâ€™s too sticky to use â€“ hours of fun! The shapes once they come out of the three moulds last well and are worthwhile â€“ though theyâ€™re only likely to be used once and then forgotten about. Overall& the set& though a little on the small side& is creative and fun and makes a pretty nice present."
714,234,5," I bought this game to play on holiday with my two grand-daughters aged 2 and 4.They loved it and we played it every night as a family.It was so successful that I plan to buy other games in the series.It was well made - pretty substantial for little fingers and very good value for money."
715,234,4," A very good game especially to exercise memory! As a therapist I have played it with a wide range of children. The only difficulty is that some of the Ostrich's heads don't go easily inside the holes& but you can assist your child to do it. Don't hesitate to buy it!"
716,234,4," My daughter loves this game.  She loves the glitter and is always looking to find the pink osterich.  It holds her interest more than other games and helps with colours and learning to take turns as well as memory."
717,234,5," Hours of great time&my little one love it!!! Great time for all family.Child will learn colours and rules high recommended"
718,235,5," Ideal for grandson for doing homework or playing games& there is no doubt about the time."
719,235,5," Does what it says on the tin.  Very useful for child to see how much time is left."
720,235,5," They do the job perfectly and with good price."
721,235,5," Good quality. Does what you'd expect."
722,236,5,""
723,236,5," This is a really fun play set for kids. Mine loves playing in the sandpit during the summer but now she can do pretty much the same thing indoors during the colder months.My little one has lots of Play-Doh sets and loves this kind of creative toys. This sand is a bit different from Play-Doh and it does not dry out. I would say it is not a replacement for Play-Doh but rather a different game altogether.This sand has a kind of spongy consistency and sticks together quite well. Using the included moulds the shapes are coming out nicely even with the small details being visible. It is sticky but after a while it breaks apart again& it is actually fun to watch. Looks almost like it is moving on its own - have a look on my video.It is completely odourless and does not stick to hands and most importantly to carpets. This makes it very easy to clean after your kiddo makes a mess. You can just vacuum it up from carpets and on solid floors it can be easily swept up.The amount of sand you get in this set (450g) is a good starting point. You can easily do a couple of moulds from it in one go. However& if you want to build something like a decent size sand castle you will need a few more packs.In the box you get a plastic container for storing the sand. It is only made out of thin plastic and it will easily break so would recommend getting something sturdier. Sand comes in a sealed plastic bag stored away in the container. You also get three moulds& princes cardboard cutouts and some jewels.The box itself is very nice with lots of colourful pictures. Perfect for a gift. One thing I did not like is the fact that all the things you get only take half the space inside. The other half is empty so the box could be much smaller.Read more â€º"
724,236,5," â€¢ Note: The supplier kindly sent me a review sample for evaluation& the opinions expressed here are entirely my own â€¢Lovely printed full colour box with all the items inside. This is a great gift for children that enjoy playing with play sand. The theme of this set is disney princesses. Included in the box are the following:-3 moulds450 grams of pink play sand (comes in its own tub)24 jewels4 different cardboard princess cutoutsThis would make any little girl very happy to have such a lovely complete set& it has all 4 princesses (Cinderella& Ariel& Belle and Rapunzel). They come as cutout cardboard shapes to play with and decorate and make your own Disney Princess scene.The moulds are firm plastic and are not flexible but should last long as they cannot be easily broken. This set is really suitable for young children and the moulds could be reused again and again and if you should run out of the play sand provided you could always use the moulds with clay& glycerine soap or beach sand. They are small enough to pack in a ziplock bag and take with you to the beach.Really sweet set that I am sure lots of little girls would be happy to receive at Christmas time. Best to play with an adult present due to small jewels. Also& best to store in a different tub to the one provided as it is not that strong and will break in time."
725,236,5," This is a beautiful Disney Princess play sand set a good â€˜noveltyâ€™ product for children who are perhaps more accustomed to more usual toys. It is certainly different and it has a real novelty value that is guaranteed to grab and hold their attention.The box contains a bag of sand& a tray and three moulds. The sand itself is basically sand mixed with a harmless polymer and a bright pink dye. The polymer makes the sand grains stick together slightly so if you pack it into a mould the sand holds the shape of the mould for a while. The adhesion gradually breaks down and the sand shape slowly falls apart into semi-loose grains again. Itâ€™s a bit like playing with set sand on the beach but the sand is more â€˜stickyâ€™ and the polymer helps give any moulded shape greater definition.The polymer itself is clean and odour-free. The sand has no distinct smell and it doesnâ€™t leave any sticky residue on your hands. It doesnâ€™t stick to carpets or solid surfaces or anything. If you do get any on the carpet you can just vacuum it up.The sand is coloured bright pink although you can buy lots of other colours separately if you want (the sparkly gold is really cool).Overall this is a great toy sand set and I would highly recommend it.Please note I received this in exchange for a honest review and this has not biased my opinion in any way."
726,237,5," Kept Grandson happy"
727,237,5," Great fun activity"
728,238,3," A nice idea but the pieces behind each door are really small so a bit too fiddly I've found. Also& there are so many pieces they don't all fit on the felt. Good quality though and I'll keep a hold of it and see if my kids like it better next year when they are a bit older."
729,238,5," I bought this in June. Got it for Â£7 and of course just opened it now. It's really a lovely calendar. Sturdily made. Stands up nicely. The pieces are really nice and the way it's made means it could be used again next year. Makes a nice change from chocolate ones."
730,238,5," Had been stocking up on items to help fill the long run up to Christmas as the kids break up a good week before the big day......this will hopefully become a family tradition and although not opened looks like it will last a few Christmases."
731,238,4," Good fun& but perhaps there were too many pieces& or it needed to have a box with it to help organise the pieces."
732,238,5," A nice change to the usual advent calender which can be used again again due to the good quality material used"
733,238,5," This was a very different advent calendar and packaged in such away that l will be reusing it next Christmas!"
734,239,5," Christmas present for my daughter she loved this sand..I had fun playing with it too :)"
735,240,5," excellent"
736,241,4," This is a great advent calendar with a couple of totally exclusive figures in it...Santa c3po for example( though to be honest I think I preferred last years Santa Darth Vader) there are a couple of |fillers| like the fire pit that are not as good as the little Lego characters& but still have merit and help set the Christmas scene.Each of the 24 Windows houses a little plastic bag containing all the Lego pieces that you need to make that days little model ( no missing pieces left rattling round the box or getting muddled up thanks to the bag!) which only takes a couple of minutes to put together. The models then go on the flap that folds down from the front of the box to build up your Lego story scene...the kid in everyone will love setting up these models to tell their story simply because it is so much fun& festive visitors always comment on our Lego advent calendars and somehow seem to end up playing with it& rearranging the scene or modifying the model in some way.The models are your usual Lego quality& fun to build and take part again time after time& the designs are a quirky twist on the usual star wars Lego and the whole thing is great....more expensive than any other of the Lego advent calendars but still great....if you want to try to recoup some money the little men & particularly the limited edition special Lego men are very collectable and have a whole market of buyers who you can sell them to when the new year comes...if you can bear to part with them that is.After all the talk& this set passes the ultimate kid test...they love it& can't wait to open the doors each morning and build that days model & never forget to open the window ( unlike the chocolate advent calendars where they always forget and end up with 3 or 4 doors to open at once).Read more â€º"
737,241,3," Oh dear the price hikes have started. This is a good Lego calendar. You get lots of lovely little Lego starwars pieces& but you also get some fillers that are a bit of a let down& like the fire for example. The figures are great and on the days when you open the door to reveal R2D2 it puts a smile on your face for the rest of the day& they are definitely the star of the show. The box flap is a great place to build your Lego starwars Christmas scene and no visitors can not resist playing with - many are very jealous and many who don't have one this year will have one next year after seeing mine. Each model is quick and easy to put together - you don't get ( nor do you need ) instructions with some of the little bags of pieces& but the picture on the front of the box pretty much explains what you need to do. There are several little bags with spare pieces too.It is a great countdown throughout December and a million times better than the cheap chocolate ones."
738,241,5," A wondrous path through the weeks leading to Christmas& for anyone who had his childhood carved by Lucas' images of galaxies far& far away. This year there was all the more reason to celebrate by way of this advent. I just wish there were more characters and less vehicles since there is no detail in the latter and they are very abstract at this scale anyway."
739,241,4," This item is a very good way to count down the days to Christmas.the 24 micro builds inside range from all areas of the galaxy such as"
740,241,5," Another fantastic advent calendar. Yes it may appear expensive& but it is well worth the money for the excitement each day opening the next door. Also& if you consider the number of pieces included& the price isn't too bad.This was our 3rd Star Wars advent calendar& and it didn't start brilliantly as we had (and still don't) have any idea what the build is! But the rest of the  days were great& especially the last 3.The best thing about this year's is that it is not year specific (unlike previous years)& so you can always buy this one to use Christmas 2016+."
741,241,3," This is the 3rd year running I have bought a Lego Advent Calendar for my son& but the first year it has been a Star Wars one.He actually chose this over the normal Lego City one he usually has& but I must say I wish he had stuck to what he knows.This just does not seem as exciting as the Lego City ones where you get to build a 'scene'.I would only really recommend this to true Star Wars fans as half of the models - I have no idea what they are supposed to be!"
742,241,3," Kids tore the box apart to get at the toys and destroyed the advent calendar dimension in the process. That they entirely missed the point of an advent calendar and remain none the wise despite an explanatory telling off is more a factor of their age (3) than the design of this product. But as precious money was wasted and Lego are still doing just fine& especially with their new movies and what have you& I feel three stars is justified."
743,242,5," Just fun to build& not to hard at all. It looks quite the part as a 'stealth' starfighter& Minifigs are nice also. I like Lego"
744,242,5," Arrived in good time& well pacakged and as described - Thank you - My 7yr old son made it within a few hours - he's Lego mad and this has added to his collection nicely"
745,242,5," Our six year-old had saved up Â£7 and wanted me to get the Jek14 minifigure for him.  Except to buy the minifigure on its own was going to cost Â£16.  No way was I spending Â£16 on a tiny bit of plastic that wasn't even in the original star wars films!  But I had promised to get Jek 14.  So I ended up paying an extra Â£38 for this kit.  And it hurt!  It wasn't Christmas or anyone's birthday and we don't want to spoil him.  I physcially groaned for a couple of days after paying for this.  But - it really is good!  Little one got his Jek 14 minifigure& and we all spent some happy family time building the aircraft& which is not for building in a day& but rather over a week or two.  It looks really good when finished and it's the biggest lego ship he's ever had.  I have now said - no more toys until Christmas.  I have to say that although Â£45 is a heck of a lot to spend on lego& it is kind of worth it and better than spending Â£60 on lego. We also found it was nicer and more relaxed building a lego kit at this time of year (Spring)& as everything is so hectic at Christmas and there are so many other things to do.  The pain of spending the money is wearing off a bit now - I'll just have to sell some of his old baby toys to recoup!  The finished ship is about 14| long and about 13| wide and is quite impressive to see.  It comes with four minifigures - Jek 14& an R2 type droid& a blue Clone Trooper type thing and a bounty hunter.  The age range says 8 to 14 but our six year old found it a piece of cake to build - if a child under 8 has built a couple of smaller kits before& they could manage this I reckon.  It helped that there were two large (about A4) sized instruction booklets with it& with easy to see diagrams spread out in short stages.Read more â€º"
746,242,5," Lego never disappoints . Was put off by price at first but it's big when made up. Son loves it. Easy for him to make at 8 years old."
747,242,5," I didn't think much of the design but it wasn't for me. It was for my 6 year old son who loved it. So I guess it was a good buy"
748,242,5," My 11-year old grandson is mad on Lego and he will have great pleasure putting this together& trouble is he is very good as putting Lego together so rather than days putting it together I expect it will be hours !!  I know he will love it."
749,242,5," An amazing toy for a keen collectorI still believe the star wars lego toys are a bit over priced but they are amazing"
750,242,5," My boy loves it& what more can I say other than my lads love lego & but once they are made they are gluged together with PVA so they stop breaking.. MORE LEGO !!!"
751,243,5," This timer is rather large. I know it was going to be big and as I wanted a little one like this and couldn't find one I settled on this one. It is 6.5 inches in height and 2 3/4 inches wide. The orange salt runs through really quickly and lasts 2 minutes. Great for using to time infusing your tea or use as any type of timer including an egg timer. Quite bright orange& fashionable and looks just like the picture.Looks well made and I do hope it will last& it seems like it will."
752,243,4," Great for using as a tooth brushing timer.  Not incredibly accurate as it's out by a few seconds.  However& I don't think anyone who wanted super accuracy would be turning to this.  We had used the tiny timers in the past but they kept getting dropped& lost and broken in the bathroom.  This is a substantial item which will last a long time.I wish there had been more colour options for the two minute timer& but that's just a minor issue."
753,243,5," Great size& just what I needed& big and easy to see.  Perfect for my 2 year old who struggles leaving the house or moving on from activities& he knows we have to go when the sand runs out.  Has also been used for time out on the naughty step."
754,243,5," We have a number of these& of different timing lengths and use them for a variety of child related reasons. Brushing teeth& homework& getting dressed& etc. very effective and having checked the time against a stop watch also very accurate."
755,243,5," does what it says on the tin. 2 minute timer bought for my autistic son who 'needs' to brush his teeth for exactly two minutes. this item has taking the anxiety out of a simple task. decent size and will not break :-)"
756,243,5," Excellent for use with our toddler. We use it for time on the potty / time left in the park / how much dinner can you eat in the time etc. It's big enough for him to see the sand going through."
757,244,5," endless fun for the kids& not too much mess for me."
758,245,5," I was impressed with the quality of the lanyard.The printed pictures were clear and I feel I got a great deal"
759,245,5," Love this lanyard& would love one with all the dwarfs on!"
760,245,5," Perfect for our trip to Disneyland Paris!"
761,245,5," Nice and a bit of fun for the user."
762,245,5," Really p&eased"
763,246,5," This hourglass is identical to the branded ones sold on amazon but for a fraction of the price. Yes they are dispatched from china but if you don't need it urgently I would recommend getting this one and save money. Well built and sturdy enough for a toddler."
764,246,5," One word great thanks"
765,246,5," Nice product"
766,246,5," Great item.."
767,247,5," my son loved this great to build and is now a przed item in his lego collection. Arrived quickly and packaged well. so 5 out of 5 for this."
768,247,5," Very fast delivery& very happy with the quality!! recommended! This comes with detailed guide so my 5 year old loves it!!"
769,247,5," An addictive collection of lego star wars this one is really nice .. the person that got it loved every bit of it!"
770,247,3," Good quality and much bigger than I was expecting. A very good present bought for my 8 year old daughter."
771,247,5," A great item for lego. My son loves it and it's a great size when made. Happy teenager happy mum."
772,247,5," OK - I'll add a slight caveat to that - when bought at a reasonable price.It seems that Legos' latest Star Wars range has had a not insubstantial price hike and I probably wouldn't have picked this up except that I spotted it at Â£10.But it is a real gem. The new Jango Fett mini figure is nice to see in a pack at this price and the track pieces add a good level of detail to the model.My 7 year old loves it as it allows him to pitch his clones with their speeders and cannons against something more than just cannon fodder droids!"
773,247,5," One very happy your lad has now added another fine model to his collection! What model is next on the list?"
774,247,4," I brought this for my freinds son for xmas he will love it however it is smaller then I expected it be and comes in aall little pieces which are not in a bag they r just inside the box so I'd imagine it would be easy to lose the bits"
775,248,4," Every year when it comes to buying advent calenders& I grumble at the high cost of the LEGO/Playmobil options - but by Christmas Day& I'm convinced that they are among the best value for money items that I've purchased.If your child likes Lego/Playmobil& then they'll love these calenders& and you can console yourself with the fact that the figures can be integrated into their existing collection once the Festive Season is over."
776,248,4," I must admit to being a tiny bit hooked on these things.You get nice models&opening the 'windows' is always fun as well.You will never get bored because the bricks just get added to the collection.I've found that there are always quite a few duplicate bricks among the sets&which is a nice bonus.Also....don't chuck away the box&there are 24 inner plastic compartments which are ideal for storing the smaller bricks or&as my wife has found out&great for planting seedlings.You really can't lose with these sets!"
777,248,5," this looks really good so we wanted to get our other grandson one but you are only allowed to purchase one at a time in seven days which wasn't very helpful but the product is really good"
778,248,5," Every year& it's the one advent calendar we absolutely must have.  For around one quid per window& it's a bargain as well as lots of fun making up the various characters or items such as miniature ships.  I've been accused of buying this for myself rather than my son& but what parent would be that cruel?  Of course it's for him!  Absolutely& and unequivocally.There are no disappointments in this calendar& there haven't been any disappointments in the past seven calendars we've had over the years.  Some things are cooler& but nothing is bad or boring or less than fun.  Beats chocolate& any time."
779,248,4," I brought this for my partner"
780,248,4," This rating was provided by my 5-year old son after much deliberation.  He was very excited by it and after explaining ratings he made me provide this rating."
781,248,5," i bought this for my husbands 40th birthday& we got last years calendar and he was thrilled with it& so i had no problem at all buying him this years. the novelty is fantastic& there is a flap that comes down at the front for your models to stand on and the box is decorated with a festive design. he loves to sit down at the table with our children and build the model of the day.we even have a display case on our wall so that the mini figures that come with the sets are on show all the time. a great buy for any star wars lego lover!!"
782,248,5," What do you get for your 6 year old son who likes Star Wars minifigures& but is not keen on building Lego?  This calendar was a great present in the build up to Christmas.  There are 24 models& about  half are minifigures of some sort& the rest are very easy to put together battle ships.  Every day was like Christmas day& before going to school.  We got the Lego City calendar for our other son (v good too).  On Dec 25 each child only got one present and some books.  Everyone was happy."
783,249,5," Grandchildren love it. No mess"
784,249,5," As described"
785,250,5," This is a cross between sand and play dough and my 3 yr old son loves it. This is much easier for him to play with than play dough and I highly recommend it!Pros: Much more easier to play with than play doughCons: It's much more messier than play dough"
786,250,3," It OK & but only for use outdoors"
787,250,5," Good fun"
788,250,3," Kids enjoyed it but the sand went everywhere and took me ages cleaning up. Great if you have an empty flat room& but for normal houses it isn't practical."
789,250,5," Great!"
790,251,4," I was looking around for muppet bits and bobs.This is a pass holder but I am using it as a key holder :)Super fun& practical !Everyone takes a second look to see what it is!Kids love it ! And I get to find my keys in my black hole of a hand bag.Very happy me"
791,251,5," Back to my youth!!! Love it"
792,251,5," I bought this for my work and absolutely love it! Everyone compliments me when I have it on. I've had it for over a year now and it still looks brand new! I would definitely recommend this to anyone."
793,251,5," Great little find. Good material and good length. A well needed accessory to brighten up my uniform and a great conversation starter! Would definitely recommend"
794,251,5," Absolutely love this lanyard :-D so many compliments from the patients (both children and adult). Brightens the wards up for sure :-D"
795,251,5," This Lanyard With Kermit the Frog Dangle - The Muppets ID Holder was bought as a present and went down very well. Fun item."
796,251,5," Lovely fun lanyard for my 10 year old. She has now had it for several months. Still functional and looking good."
797,252,5," It's a 5 minute timer. I really only got it because it's yellow. My son loves yellow. I use it for time out."
798,252,5," This little timer works very well. I use it when I'm listening to children at school read and keep it in my handbag. Great value for money."
799,252,5," timed this as bang on 5 minutes. Thats what i bought it for! very pleased with it given the price even if the build isnt the greatest."
800,252,5," Brilliant does the job."
801,253,5," Needed this for piano  practice and it works great.  Good colour too so gets them sitting for the allotted time!  Delivery good and well packaged on arrival."
802,253,5," Took a few weeks to arrive (as predicted). Attractive and useful 10minute timer."
803,254,3," The box that you can use to help create scenes and play with the sand would be better if it was a little deeper& the sand spills over the edge quite easily& otherwise fine."
804,254,5," This is very popular in our house my 5 year old and 18 month old love it and its not to messy as comes with a handy box."
805,254,5," great amazing stuff& no mess that sand makes my daughter loves it. much cheaper than toy shops"
806,254,5," This is fantastic! So easy to clean up if dropped on the floor. My two year old loves it!!"
807,254,5," I am a childminder and the children I look after are really enjoying playing with this fascinating sand. They like to mould with it and the shapes in this set are great"
808,254,5," Great buy. My sons 6 and 1 loved it."
809,254,5," Gift for a friends little one& they ordered another set but said this make was much better!!"
810,254,5," Brilliant fun for the toddler. The sand leaves no mess so ideal for rainy days in the house"
811,255,5," Ideal for 4-5 year olds with supervision. Unfortunately after creating our pretty desing my daughter decided to shake the bottle and all the sand mixed up so it doesn't look so good. However& it's fun to do and the finished product can make great little presents for family or friends. Am actually considering buying another one."
812,255,5," The kids really enjoyed making the sand bottles (3 in different shapes as pictured) in this kit.  The eight packets of coloured sand were plenty for them to use with the funnel and scoop it came with and they were easily able to make stripy patterns.  They didn't really use the supplied tool that fits into the bottle to mix up the sand but you could do this if you wanted to try different effects.Unlike other bottle art we've done before these seem to be quality - the plastic is thick enough so that the sand hasn't all mixed up into a mess of colour.There's rather a lot of packaging& but like every Melissa and Doug craft I've ever tried this kit is great quality& works and children love it.  I will be buying more for birthday presents for the 5-8 range I think as it's great value too."
813,255,5," The colours of the sand were very strong and very pretty and there were a lot of them. The little tools (funnel etc) worked very well. My child loved this craft set. I would recommend this to anyone with little preschool kids."
814,255,5," For the money I didn't expect a lot from this and i hadn't bought snything melissq and doug before& but great sized bottles and bags of sand. Really surprised. I would highly recommend this."
815,255,4," christmas gift"
816,255,5," I brought 2 of these for my children last year and another 2 for their friends and they are a huge hit&&&There's plenty of sand to fill each bottle to the top and even had some left over which they used on an art picture. The colours are lovely and bright and my son liked that each bottle was a different shape."
817,255,5," I bought this for a little girl of 5 and she loved it& so did her brother who is two and a half& with a little help it made into a super clooured sand bottle."
818,255,5," Good quality bottles with plenty of sand to fill bottles. My 3 yr old and 12 yr old enjoyed making these. Would recommend and buy again"
819,256,4," My daughter loves it . Just to expensive changing from sterling into euros . But I would buy it again ."
820,256,4," Nice to have something different than chocolate in calendar"
821,256,5," My daughter was thrilled to receive this."
822,256,5," Always a hit.  Arrived speedily."
823,257,5," MY 3 Y OLD LOVE IT! EASY TO BUILD AND SHAPE ANYTHING YOU WANT.I LOVE IT! IT WAS MY FIRST TIME BUILDING A PERFECT SAND CASTLE.THE BEST IT WAS WHEN IT FALL DOWN IN CARPET IT WAS EASY TO PUT BACK AND PLAY.PERFECT FOR INDOORS PLAY! IT IS FUNNY TO BUILD AND LEARN THE NUMBERS."
824,257,5," Brill my 4 year old loves it we baught a tray similar size to a litter tray for table time play"
825,257,4," My 2 year old son loves this. I've cut my hand getting the box open twice - surely it doesn't have to be so difficult to get into? Minor complaint though."
826,257,5," I love this stuff and so do my boys. We have used it with small toy figures to make dinosaur land etc and had loads of fun"
827,257,5," Fab product kids loved it. Easy to clean up and great price. Was used indoors as well"
828,257,5," I bought this for a little boy I work with who has autism and loves sensory play. He adores this item and is constantly fascinated by the kinetic sand. The number cutters are useful for squeezing in some learning too."
829,257,5," brilliant and very fast delivery. thank you"
830,257,5," Fabulous present& hardly any mess.  The little boy I bought it for (3 year old) has played with it for hours and the box allows him to take it to Grandma's& childminders etc."
831,258,5," Wonderful stuff! My son plays with it all the time. Only downfall is the price because you only get a small amount for this price."
832,258,1," Suppose to be bright purple on all the pictures& is an insipid pink not happy"
833,258,2," Not as advertised on the TV& much less content"
834,258,5," Totally amazing stuff. Addictive. Daughter always has it out. No mess. Brilliant. Comes with moulds and a tray for playing with sand."
835,258,5," My little 5year old Granddaughter says she loves Kinetic sand and really enjoys playing with it!"
836,258,5," Absolutely brilliant our whole family(ages from 10-52) loved this . We have all played with it can't resist it& very relaxing"
837,258,5," bought it for my nephew's birthday& kid couldn't be more happy!"
838,258,5," Excellent Christmas present for our 3 year old Grandson"
839,259,5," Lovely product kids love it"
840,260,4," Great fun for children."
841,261,1," Thought this would make a lovely different calendar& however it looked cheap and tacky& the box was broken even before it arrived& also thought there would be a Barbie for the amount of money even at full price.Cheap cheap cheap don't waste your money and dissappoint your little girl like I did.It's now in the BIN !!!!!!!!It's also dated 2014 in the description& rubbish."
842,261,5," Packaged very well. Was worried about possible damage in transit but not a mark on it. Looks great with really bright colours. Have no doubt my daughter will be thrilled with it"
843,261,3," The product looked cheap and I expected better gifts behind each door. The gifts weren't great and could have been for any doll& expected more for my money"
844,261,5," Great item. Much bigger than expected. Fast deliveryMy daughter saw this and let out an excited scream!! Very very happy"
845,261,4," The items are a bit cheap n tacky but regardless my step daughter is so excited to open it. Good idea."
846,261,5," My daughter loved it& was great for the run up to Xmas and she now has tons if barbie accessories!"
847,261,3," Glad I got this on sale as I wouldn't pay full price for it. My girls love it though."
848,261,5," Great price and arrived quickly& looking forward to little lady having it in december"
849,262,4," For Â£5 this is a good little taster pot to see if you want to buy more products. Enough there for a little play as an alternative to play - doh."
850,262,5," as advertised& prompt delivery"
851,262,4," GOOD&BUT A SMALL AMOUNT"
852,263,5," We live in a flat with no garden and so wanted something that the kids could play with but be easy to contain and clear up. This sand is perfect& it doesn't spread everywhere and you can make the most detailed castles and molds from it. Great fun."
853,263,5," Excellent& it keeps my son happy and busy all the day"
854,263,5," Impressed with this product& great price and it's a great activity for a rainy day. I managed to buy a big tray to keep the sand together and the kids have hours of fun."
855,263,5," Absolutely love this& great product and a great price too. You even get cutters and a tub to store it all in when you've finished playing with it."
856,263,5," This is brilliant !!! Kids can play with this without it getting into every nook n crannie in the house !! It's fascinating........I love it !!!"
857,263,5," One of best products I've found& hours of fun and very entertaining to kids& we put sand in mega blocks and made perfectly shape bricks"
858,263,5," Bought to stop the arguments over the one set we already have.... Now twice the sand and cutters so everyone is happy!!"
859,263,5," Excellent product. Bought for a present for a 4 year old and played with far more than his bigger gifts."
860,264,4," Hasn't quite solved my procrastination issues& but looks pretty sat on a shelf. It wasn't quite as nicely finished as ones I've seen in the shops& but was a lot cheaper and you don't notice from a distance& so not a problem really. :-)"
861,264,5," it is colourful and is useful for what I want it to achieve. I would recommend it to teachers/parents or carers as a fun tool to teach the concept to time especially for children with developmental disorders."
862,264,3," I expected more accuracy. Instead of 15 min mine goes for 16m40s...But otherwise& if you are not so carefull about minutes - this is a nice piece of a sand timer."
863,265,4," I agree with previous reviews that say that this is extremely expensive for what you get. The front picture is very misleading as the amount of sand you actually get is about a quarter of what is pictured. I also bought my daughter a separate refill pack to bulk it out a bit which turned out to be a good (but pricey) move. That said& it is the most fascinating stuff I have come across! I've no idea how it works& but it is great to play with. The kids are addicted to it and I have to confess to having a shot of it myself!"
864,265,2," I was pretty disappointed with this product as it doesn't live up to the impression given by the box art.First off the tiny hand gives a false impression of size& this thing is less than a foot square& not the large looking tray depicted. Secondly& the tray in the photo is packed with sand& the box you receive bears small print (not shown on the product page) which advises that photo shows 2lb of sand& not the supplied 1lb& so that& not only is the tray small it is less than half full.The Kinetic sand itself is interesting stuff& and our boy has found it fun to play with& however the small size of the tray does mean the stuff escapes and unless you're vigilant can make a mess. The moulds (not molds) work well and the sand retains its shape and can even be shaped to a small degree in the hand& though unless it's supported will lose its shape quickly.On the subject of mess& I can't understand why a lid wasn't included& we've resorted to using a carrier bag to put the tray in but this isn't entirely suitable as if the box gets accidentally turned upside down it makes a bit of a mess.Something I didn't consider was the environmental impact of this stuff& when it gets into the environment& as it is polymer coated sand& I can't think of a suitable method of disposal"
865,265,3," The tray looks massive on the box but is& in reality& pretty small. It's nowhere near big enough to contain the mess& so what's the point? That said& Kinetic Sand is good fun and our 3.5yr old really enjoys playing with it. Stick a plastic playmat down and put the tray in the middle is the key."
866,265,5," Expensive for the amount you get but ideal for my special needs daughter she loves the texture - happy daughter = happy mummy"
867,265,3," If you are impressed by the illustration on the box you will be disappointed with the actual contents!The moulds are tiny& not made from a very sturdy plastic and the sand is difficult to remove intact from the castle mould.You only get one colour& purple so to make play more interesting you will need to buy other colours from the range& personally I will not be doing that because the novelty has already worn off after an hour or so with a 4 year old who called the set |silly|. Out of the mouths etc. etc.I really didn`t find the tray very useful because it is just over 20 mm deep and the sides are not even straight& thankfully I put a plastic tablecloth underneath. The kinetic sand is just okay& a bit funny to the touch but nothing special. I can see these moulds being used with Play dough more than anything else.Another small point is the packaging& it`s difficult enough to find anything in English on the box but when removing the tape from the side opening part of the instructions peeled of as well. I cannot justify the price for what you get here and do not recommend& sorry."
868,265,5," This is a good â€˜noveltyâ€™ product for children who are perhaps more accustomed to more usual toys. It is certainly different and it has a real novelty value that is guaranteed to grab and hold their attention.The box contains a bag of sand& a tray and four moulds. The sand itself is basically sand mixed with a harmless polymer and a bright purple dye. The polymer makes the sand grains stick together slightly so if you pack it into a mould the sand holds the shape of the mould for a while. The adhesion gradually breaks down and the sand shape slowly falls apart into semi-loose grains again. Itâ€™s a bit like playing with damp sand on the beach but the sand is more â€˜stickyâ€™ and the polymer helps give any moulded shape greater definition.The polymer itself is clean and odour-free. The sand has no distinct smell and it doesnâ€™t leave any sticky residue on your hands. It doesnâ€™t stick to carpets or solid surfaces or anything. If you do get any on the carpet you can just vacuum it up.The sand is coloured bright purple although you can buy lots of other colours separately if you want (the sparkly gold is really cool). For some reason the manufacturers chose bright purple as the standard colour to be used in the basic kit. In my opinion this was a questionable choice as some of the other more subtle colours are visually more appealing.You get one imperial pound (454g) of sand in the box. This isnâ€™t very much and you will probably find yourself buying more separately. Additional sand is expensive"
869,266,2," In our house we are massive fans of Kinetic Sand& but were pretty gutted with this version. It is THE Kinetic Sand but in it's natural sand colour it is sticky and unpleasant. It's fine if the product is reasonably priced but it is pretty dear for what it is."
870,266,5," My son absolutely loves Kinetic Sand& it is so easy to mould& has a unique texture that retains it's shape when you make a mould with it.  he loves making little gold bars with this gold sand.  It's not as sparkling gold as on the packaging but it's still a nice shade& it looks a lot like real sand so it is the most realistic looking play sand that I've seen& you can make sandcastles with this that look like they're straight off the beach.  It doesn't stain your carpet and is easy to clear away& just scoop it up and put back in the bag& it retains it's soft texture.  If there are any spillages simply sweep them up or hoover them.  As it is so easy to use it is the perfect toy for children with sensory needs as it boosts their creativity and confidence.  Hours of fun with this play sand.  Highly recommended"
871,266,3," Was okay and works fine but not at all metallic or glittering as I had hoped"
872,266,5," Wonderful & my grandson loves the product and so do I."
873,266,4," It arrived in good condition.  As it is a Christmas Present then I presume it will be  used for its intended purposwe."
874,266,5," Bought this as a stocking filler for my Granddaughter she enjoys playing with it so do I !"
875,266,5," fab does exactly what it says it should do my son has had hours of fun with this"
876,267,5," looked around for ages for coloured sand and came across this set& which was such good value& p"
877,267,4," It's actually quite difficult to estimate how much sand there is - I know it gives you a weight on the advert but try estimating that in real terms!  I found there wasn't quite enough for what I wanted but in terms of the quality of the item& it was excellent& just that my particular project needed slightly moreUPDATE: A year on and I'm still impressed with these - the initial projects were to fill glass containers to look like an ocean and then place potpourri on top for a bathroom decoration - a year on and the colours were still vibrant& plus& despite the humidity of the bathroom& the sand remained fine"
878,267,4," Great for artwork with group of pupils with sen. They loved the range of colours and were inspired to produce great mixed media Collages.  Nice colours and mixed well with acrylic paints and pva glue."
879,267,5," All the things I ordered & coloured sand and bracelets and little bottles were excellent and very popular.I am nogoing to write the same words for each -- this will have to do !"
880,267,5," My daughter want these to fill come jars with coloured sand they look great and still lots left"
881,267,4," Ok...but the colours were deceiving probably due to the nature of the contents"
882,267,5," the grandchildren loved it would recommend it"
883,268,5," magical stuff  didn't stick to anything and easy to put away at the end of the day  didn't dry up at all  it was great to play with and mould well when using pots to put it in to make shapes  we used egg cups to make mini sandcastles  well worth the money and a great |rainy day | toy to bring out"
884,268,5," I think that this product is one of the best things out there today &my children are given everything sorry to say but it is true .Normally lasts five minutes but this magical sand is the key to keeping your kids happy even Me brillðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€"
885,268,5," Kenetic sand in my daughters favourite colour .... whats not to love!"
886,269,5," Long delivery but not a problem. Great timer to help my girls to brush their teeth& and being pink is an extra bonus! Good price for it too."
887,269,3," Good buy& nice for a trinket with other presents& quite small tho."
888,269,4," Does what it says"
889,270,5," Because the sand doesnâ€™t stain and is non-toxic& it is perfect for being able to play with indoors during the winter when you canâ€™t get to the beach to make proper sandcastles!I did find it relatively mess free and& any mess that was made could be swept up easily though I will only let my children play with it in the dining room where there is no carpet.I liked that the set had a good sized tray included to play with the sand.  There was plenty of space in the trays to make plenty of sculptures and still left plenty of space for them to play with the sand.  I would have liked to have seen lids for the trays to be able to store the sand easier.The quality of the plastic modelling tools provided is great.  The plastic is strong and will stand up to a lot of play.Although Sands Alive claims to look and feel like real sand I donâ€™t really agree.  It definitely feels more like a modelling sand than real sand which is not a bad thing.  It does& however& look more like sand than other sets we have had in the past as it is sand coloured.My 7 year old son found the sand very easy to model both with his hands and with the moulds provided.  My 3 year old daughter struggled a little& though still had fun playing with the sand.The sand came out of the moulds very easily and I was really impressed with how much detail was imprinted onto the sand.Once my son had made the sculptures they did stay standing until he knocked them down to pack the sand away.  The sand does stick together very well.For the price& I think the set is excellent value for money.  You receive plenty of sand and a lot of moulds to play with.Read more â€º"
890,270,3," Cross as we forked out for what turns out to be 'cloud' dough which you can find a recipe for on the internet . Basically flour and baby oil . Â£20 for that  with 3 or 4 moulds . Was expecting something closer to moon sand which is a far superior 'sand '  The only thing - my 3 yr can't get enough of it ... He adores it ."
891,270,4," bought as a christmas pressy& pleasantly surprised as expected it to be similar to the moon dough but it isnt at all. says together really well and doestnt leave flaky bits everywhere& only thing is that the sand you get with it just covers the base of the tray you get with it so i would of liked a little bit more"
892,270,4," I think for a starter kit& this is great. The amount of sand is sufficient& I will have to but larger dish though as the sand constantly spills in the small tray they provided. I would not want to buy a smaller version of this though."
893,270,4," Kidz had a blast with this one.....Unfortunately so does the Vacuum cleaner...And the Kitchen table is now a NO GO area for this item... the sand gets everywhere and the table has ground in sand in the surface!"
894,270,4," Arrived well packaged grandson will love it. Only problem is I've just discovered it is deadly to pets and harmful to kids if ingested!!! Should have warning. Will have to be extremely vigilant..."
895,270,5," My daughters favourite toy from Christmas& she's 7 and I thought it might be too young for her but she loves it. Just the right amount of play sand too"
896,270,5," Great product no messing as it comes off clothes really easy.  Would recommend for kids and adults as a mum I enjoyed it too"
897,271,4," We were sent this in return for our honest review.The set is aimed at children aged 4 and above which I would agree with.  It is not something I would let my two year old daughter play with yet as I know she would become bored easily and end up making a mess instead!When the set arrived I didnâ€™t think it looked like there was much sand in the bag to play with& however& once tipped into the tray there was plenty there to keep my son happy.He got stuck straight in& squeezing the sand together and moulding it into shapes.  He enjoyed using the roller and tools& however& I felt there could have been a couple of moulds included to keep his attention for longer.  These can be bought separately but it would be nice to have one or two included in this set.I was happy to let my 6 year old son play with the sand indoors as it is fairly mess free.  Although he wasnâ€™t always careful to keep the sand in the play tray& what he did spill on the table was easy to clean back up into tray and I didnâ€™t find that any stuck to the furniture or the floor.I was impressed with the quality of the play tray and tools provided and feel the set provides good value for money.  I was also pleasantly surprised that the sand fit back into the bag provided with little effort as that saved me having to have an extra storage tub â€“ everything fits back into the box provided.Overall we are pleased with the Cra-Z-Sand Deluxe Play set and would definitely recommend it as a fun way to play with sand relatively mess free!"
898,271,5," Cra-Z sand is a lot of fun. It's pretty similar to kinetic sand& and sands alive in the way that it molds and moves. It is less messy than normal play sand since it sticks together differently and you won't get little sand grains all over the house& so if you are playing indoors then this is better.The set includes enough cra-z sand to play with (mine arrived in purple colour not the sand colour shown) and a tray to use while playing& plus a couple of tools like a roller and shaper but not any molds for making sandcastles or shapes. You can use any of your own sand molds though or even a cup& they will all work fine and this cra-z sand molds really well& keeping its shape better than normal sand. It is quite similar to moon sand or moon dough in the way that it moldsMy children all enjoy playing with this& ages 3& 5 and 6"
899,271,1," Not happy with this purchase. My daughter was keen to sculpt pyramids and walls and the box clearly shows these& with a vague description of 1 tray& 1 roller and 3 shaping tools.The three shapes sand sculptures on the front (a tower& a pyramid and a wall) are photographed with the tray and roller. There is no disclaimer next to these stating moulds not included.A separate image of a fish mould has a small disclaimer of no mould included. This is unacceptable and bad marketing.The included tools are all flat and the included instructions describe how to fill a mould NOT INCLUDED and use the shapers to clean the sand away.I am not impressed! There should be a clear label on the front of the box that the shapes are not included.1.5lb of sand& a cat litter tray and three bits of flat plastic are sadly not worth the money.I would send this back immediately& but unfortunately the Easter Bunny bought it and my daughter opened the product. She was disappointed that the pyramid was missing& I'll now have to look for one online."
900,271,3," Good quality sand but too little for the price"
901,271,5," Present for a 4-year old who absolutely loved it!"
902,271,5," My son absolutely loved this! And no mess!"
903,271,2," My friend had bought some &but it was a different make and was fantastic stuff. This make is very disappointing in comparison. Not as pliable and doesn't feel as great to use."
904,271,5," I bought this for my 3 year old and he loves it. Hardly any mess& moulds perfectly together. When it arrived it came purple which was good :)"
905,272,5," Took me a while to build the box and put charactors in the right place.My 5 year old son totally loves play mobil so thought it was fantastic and was excited each day to see what toy was behind the door.Nice play scene and toys are great.Seems expensive but totally worth it."
906,272,5," I normally get my children a small prsent each day for advent but this year went for the play mobil advent& i probably spent less and my son had much more fun and didn't even look for chocolate.I will be doing it again next year."
907,272,3," Lots of little bits in the box. I thought there would be bigger things in the calender."
908,272,4," Arrived promptly& a lot of excellent toys contained within. I have been prompted to give a review and so I can say that the service was excellent and it looks fantastic& but as it is an advent calendar it remains unopened."
909,273,1," The sand is rubbish - very messy and doesn't stick together. It's more like flour than sand. I have bought different mouldable sand from the Pound shop and it is much better quality than this. Very disappointed and will be asking for a refund."
910,273,4," This was a fabulous purchase for my 4 year old& he absolutely loves it and has played for hours with it. It is a pliable 'dough like'  sand which can be used with moulds and stamps to create castles or anything else your child can think of.  It comes with a good selection of moulds& a roller and a couple of stamps to help create pretty cool looking castles as per the box!The sand itself is excellent. There were two large packs in the box and it does not dry out as claimed (we left ours in the open air for around 3 days and it was still like new) by the manufacturer.Overall this was an excellent gift for my son! He loves sand and 'play doh'  and since this is like those two things mixed together& it is ideal!My only concern when buying was the mess it would probably make and while it does come with a reasonably large tray& the sand does get everywhere. It is however pretty easy to clean up& because it doesn't dry out& it also doesn't embed in your carpets. It takes a little more hoovering (going over the same spot two or three times)  it does clean up well. On tables and chairs it can just be wiped off back into the tray. It leaves and off residue in your hands also but this is removed with washing.I did find that there wasn't anything I could really do with the sand once my son had finished playing with it but I found a plastic tupperwear box that it fit into perfectly.I do think however that the product would be even better if the tray doubled as a sealable box& i imagine it wouldn't take much to refashion the tray so that it could support a lid.Even with storage issue& it is an excellent product and my son loves it! We are hoping to try out the other moulds in other packs soon!"
911,273,3," The sand is a bit messy and sticks to hands and carpets. Other brands are much superior so worth spending a little more if you can. Still fun and fast delivery."
912,273,5," Brill product hoovers up well with minimal mess and my lb loved it"
913,273,5," Great fun!Can get a little messy but cleans up easy."
914,273,5," Brilliant stuff! My daughter loves it and no mess!"
915,273,1,""
916,273,5," The manufacturer must have changed the chemical composition of this powder (supposedly modelling sand) because it is a nightmareâ€¦ when it gets in the carpet itâ€™s difficult to get out. This stuff doesnâ€™t perform at all like itâ€™s supposed to (as shown in the slick marketing videos)& it doesnâ€™t stick to itself as claimed but it does stick to fabrics with an alarming persistence& as my wifeâ€™s skirt still bears witness. I couldnâ€™t even get it out of the carpet with a vacuum cleaner& I had to rub it with a brush first and even then it still needed the pet hair attachment of the vacuum cleaner before it came out (although not completely& itâ€™s left faint white traces). If I seem annoyed about this product itâ€™s because I am& itâ€™s taken me Â½ hour so far to try cleaning up after this laughably claimed â€˜no messâ€™ modelling sandâ€™.I can only compare the residue this Sands Alive makes to that of plaster of Paris and although the sand material is not as fine it embeds itself in fabrics just as much. In the carpet& cushions and clothes& all of which needed cleaning afterwards. It even gets under the fingernailsâ€¦ my son drinks out of a plastic tumbler and all around outside was covered in a dried powdery residue& (similar to the table top) and that was easy to clean.This is the second Sands Alive set weâ€™ve bought in the last fortnight& the first was the animal set& John Adams Sands Alive Animal Set reviewed separately& and neither of them perform at all like the squidgy sand in the promo videos"
917,274,5," Brilliant alternative to play doh..& a little more messy though..."
918,274,5," Quirky ! Lots of fun for all age groups to use! Would reccomend!"
919,274,5," Bought for 8 year old Christmas present. She loved it!!!!"
920,274,5," My 2 year old loves it!"
921,275,5," My nearly two year old loves this  (don't leave a kid this young with this toy& no obvious danger& just don't do it).A nice prop to learn Rotation and revolution for kids& as well as scale and the reletive position of the earth to the moon."
922,275,5," It was a lot to pay for such a little bit of plastic& but in order to demonstrate to grandchildren (with the aid of a torch) why we get the phases of the moon it was just about worth it."
923,275,2," nice present idea i thought for my son- it was a bit smaller than expectedpainting it was difficult because the colours come out washed outand you have to sandpaper it so the paint sticks onhe lost interest pretty quickly. also would have been nice if all the countrieswere outlines so he learnt where the countries were as he painted..also. you lose where you are painting because the ridge between land and sea are to faint.."
924,275,5," Great gift."
925,275,5," I brought this for my grandson who loves anything to do with space& I was surprised how neat this was for the small amount of money it cost."
926,276,3," you don't get a lot of sand& and it's difficult to keep it looking nice when finished& a few times being picked up and looked at and it was smushy brown colour"
927,276,3," Prompt delivery however was let down by the fact that the product does not contain enough sand to fill all 4 bottles"
928,276,5," My daughter loved creating different designs with these sand bottles - can't recommend enough!"
929,276,5," As says on the box. A river on time perfect for a gift. Would buy from seller again"
930,276,5," Would recommend this product my 5 year old had great fun making these"
931,276,5," Bought as a present - one very happy little girl."
932,276,4," Looks ok but not opened as its a xmas present"
933,276,5," Christmas present.  Grand daughter delighted"
934,277,5," This jedi star fighter is nearly a tenner more than the Plo Koon set& or the Mace Windu set from a few years ago& but having built it& it is actually BIGGER and more sophisticated than these earlier models& so that explains the price. I guess as Saesee Tinn is an ace jedi pilot& he naturally gets a bigger ship.It comes with 2 instruction books& as there are enough pieces to split the build into 2 parts. Our 7 year old has built the first instruction books worth with very few errors on his own - so not such a tricky build for this age group& but tricky enough to still remain a challenge. The cockpit detaches as an escape pod& so that also explains the 2 part build.Compared to the other star fighters& it looks really cool. It has several moving parts& landing gear& cockpit cover and flick missiles. It is still smaller than the super dooper size models and as such has great swooshing potential& without too much risk of falling apart. I really like the size of these star fighter models& as they will fit easily into a plastic storage box or onto a shelf for display.Comes with 3 collectable mini guys (most star fighters include just the pilot"
935,277,5," The Lego is good quality. Very expensive but buying from Amazon was slightly less than in shops. Very prompt delivery and in perfect condition. Perfect for 9 year old Star Wars fanatic& took a good hour to make it on Christmas morning& very absorbing with clear instructions."
936,277,5," Easy to put together& bigger than expectedmy son adores it and plays with it all the time.Would recommend"
937,277,5," My sons loved building it and its one of his favourites. He likes the opening on top too. Colours are great."
938,277,4," A fun little piece with some minifigures that I haven't seen elsewhere& so if that's what interests you then I'd recommend buying this one.The build isn't TOO complicated& so if you're wanting a complex and interesting build& this one might not be for you. However& if you're looking for a smaller piece to display& then this one fits in quite nicely. Especially since the landing gear means it sits quite nicely on a shelf.In terms of playing with it& there's a decent amount it can do for its size. It has the usual flick missiles& and a place to hold the lightsabers when the Jedi is in flight& and there's even an escape pod with this one& so there are a few scenarios you can set up with it.Overall& not my favourite piece since I like complex and interesting builds& however it's a welcome addition to my collection and I think it would be fun for a younger builder to play with."
939,277,5," This is a great model& my 7 year old Son first saw it at a friends and once I tracked it down it is a firm favourite having been pulled apart and rebuilt on numerous occasions now. The starship of Jedi Master Saesee Tiin who is patrolling for Separatist forces& ready to go into battle with fellow Jedi Master Even Piell.Saesee Tiinâ€™s green starfighter is equipped with 4 missiles& an R3-D5 droid and a detachable cockpit section becomes the Jedi Masterâ€™s very own escape pod.Includes 3 minifigures: Saesee Tiin& Astromech Droid R3-D5 and Even Piell. Detailed in every way."
940,277,5," Well pleased with the |LEGO Star Wars 9498: Saesee Tiin's Jedi Starfighter| - I bought for my nephew.  I would recommend this product  - swift delivery thank you."
941,277,5," This Star Wars Gift was a great hit with my Grandson  He was so excited when he received it that he rang me to tell me all about it."
942,278,5," Excellent product that works very well.  I purchased this for my 5 year old and he and his older brother have used it a lot.  It sticks well together& and I consider the materials added to be safe for my children.One challenge is where to store the sand - it's for indoors play but it can still make a mess on the carpet.  If bits fall on the carpet& the larger bits can be picked up but the small bits need the vacuum cleaner to come round.  We have used a large biscuit tin to store it in& but unless the kids play in a very tranquil way they end up spilling over onto the carpet.  I've made an order for a mixing tray to solve that problem:  MIXING TRAY& CHILDREN'S PLAY MAT& SAND PIT& WATER& PLASTIC& TOYS& POOL PIT& (Green)Update:  I decided to purchase a second kinetic sand pack for Christmas since I'm buying a mixing tray which gives extra playing space.  At the time of writing there are two sellers& in-stock seller at Â£33 and Amazon out of stock at Â£15.  I purchased the out of stock Amazon one on 6 December 2014 and received it just a few days later on 11 December 2014.  However it is still showing out of stock on Amazon today (11 December 2014).  Given the price difference I strongly suggest to buy from Amazon even if it shows out of stock."
943,278,5," This stuff is evil and magical too. Keeps kids entertained also good for developing motor skills in hands and arms for children elderly or disabled person highly recommended"
944,278,5," My children love this. Amazing for messy play but without the mess and great for children that don't like getting bits on there hands."
945,278,5," Superb stuff. Bought for my 12 yr old however we've all had a shot playing with it. Great fun and without a mess.A great buy."
946,278,5," Myself and the kids love it& I also have some at the nursery I work at and it's great as a sensory activity as well as creative."
947,278,4," great gift and kept the children quiet for many hours&"
948,278,5," I got this as a present for my missus for Christmas but we got plastered and opened it. It goes everywhere. Although it's kinetic. Once it gets in somewhere it's never leaving either. I've shampooed and hoovered our carpets. We played with it in bed while I was eating eating kebab and I'm pretty sure I ingested quite a lot of the sand. All in all its excellent"
949,278,5," Fantastic quality. Bought this in May and still as good as new. My son hides his ninja turtles in it and makes tall pyramid with it. My daughter makes little cakes and mask shapes to carve out eyes& nose...etc Great for imaginary play.Keep in a tub to keep nice."
950,279,5," The all new Lego Star Wars advent calendar is an absolute winnerThere are so many desirable items in this set.My personal faves:- Darth Vader Santa!- Tiny land speeder- Light sabre fireplace- Droid Christmas Tree- Tie Fighter and pilotIt is shame there isn't a Leia& but otherwise this is a truly excellent advent calendar for any Lego Star Wars fan.  All relatively easy to build& albeit a bit tricky for younger children& and definitely healthier than chocolate.Five stars."
951,279,5," Brilliant as always.  I buy one every year for my son who's now 36 and my 12 year grandson. Good value and great fun."
952,279,2," Would be brilliant if there were any building instructions :o/I've had to reverse engineer the 1st December by magnifying the contents on the Amazon page!!  Also gone on the Lego site and there are none available!!It seems I'm not alone as there are others in the same predicament...1 Day LaterI have now tried to contact Lego and this is what I found...|The LEGO Advent Calendars don't include traditional building instructions. When you open the door for each day& you'll find a picture of what the pieces inside can build. If for some reason you've lost the box or it's been damaged& you can download a PDF file below. The PDF files show a scan of what's behind the doors.|Below is an exploded view of the various days models...why couldn't they provide that in the box!!!Very shoddy for Â£25 !"
953,279,5," I am really impressed with another quality Lego product. The Hoth white Christmas theme is really well presented and the selection of mini kits& equipment and characters are really well done.The hardest thing I'm finding is stopping my 3 year old padawan from opening all the panels at once. He's a lot like Anakin... no patience."
954,279,4," Purchased for my grandson & as normal advent Calender & and as he is a Star Wars and Lego fan & he enjoys this immensely & and diligently assembles or adds to his other Lego sets each day the Magic Day approaches"
955,279,5," Why have chocolate in your advent when you can have Star Wars Lego?! Such an awesome idea and much more exiting to open each day. I've bought this for partner in his mid 20's so it's not just for kids& I will get this again next year for sure. Highly recommend it to all"
956,279,5," Who ever thought of combining Lego with Star Wars& two of my favourite things as a kid is a genius!!!And now they've made it even better and have turned it into an advent calendar. Honestly!!! I bought this with the intention of giving it to my son. And I did - eventually. It arrived at work& I opened it and then I accidentally opened the box and opened day 1. At this point& I just couldn't do it and ended up keeping it for the month of December.It ended up being a good work reward for my team - whom ever had done a good job got the pleasure of opening the next window and assembling the toy. It was great fun and I'll definitely be buying another one this year."
957,279,5," I'll admit I actually bought this for myself as my Christmas calendar :D It's brilliant& more characters than I thought there would be and something to make every morning. Any fan of Star Wars should have this!"
958,280,4," Bought for 7 year old granddaughter and looks to be suitable& although there's a lot of plastic. Don't feel it would suit an 11 year old and up as its more for play"
959,280,1," Not worth it! My daughter is so into Elsa and Anna and the whole Frozen thing. I was really excited about this advent calendar.It is very expensive for what is inside. On one day all she got was a sticker...really 55.00 plus shipping for a sticker and cheap plastic toys! What a Big Disappointment!"
960,280,5," My granddaughter loves everything 'frozen' and so far is loving this advent calendar. Nice range of make up and accessories and makes a change from usual chocolate calendar. I think the price is reasonable and in keeping with other similar calendars."
961,280,5," It was so worth the wait! Granddaughter loves it.  Every day she is so excited about opening it by date.  Didn't arrive in time for Christmas& but it didn't matter& she is using it as an everyday calendar."
962,280,5," It was out of stock on Norway and my eight year old niece have no declared that I am the best uncle ever. She loved it ðŸ‘§"
963,280,1," What a croc!! Big con& gift are nothing to do with frozen. My daughter and I are both disappointed."
964,280,5," A lot of money for what you get but have given it 5 stars for gie happy it made my daughter!"
965,281,4," Kept small stuff amused for a bit.  Kept me amused for longer."
966,281,5," Took a while to arrive& but was received very well."
967,281,5," my granddaughter loved her gift for christmas"
968,281,5," Kids love it"
969,282,5," Don't waste your money on the expensive stuff& this is just brilliant! My 2 year old son loves this& he gets it out most mornings and spends a good half an hour playing with it - priceless for a 2 year old! Cleans up really easily and very easy for him to build sand castles and make prints - big hit in our house.  (It advised 3+ years - so please play with supervision!)"
970,282,5," This is full of great stuff for the kids ..fantastic.how it mounds back together&&&hours of fun ..."
971,282,5," Quick delivery. I bought this and the beach set as I've got two children and that way they both had enough sand and shapes to share without fighting! They sat for hours playing together nicely I have to add and I found myself joining in making everything you could possibly imagine when your 5 year old comes up with the ideas! Would highly recommend. The sand may have got it the carpet but it's easy enough to pick up and put back in the tuff tray and Hoover the minimal that's left up."
972,282,3," Sand box was a lot smaller than expected. Had to purchase extra sand from another shop to add to the set as it was a gift and looked inadequate on its own."
973,282,4," Fantastic product - kids love it and it is slightly less messy than the real thing. The only real negative I found was that you need to find an enclosed 'playmat/surface' unless you want it getting everywhere and losing half of it. We ended up using a bucket lid. It is fascinating the way the sand 'moves' after you put it down after you have been moulding it in your hands. It is great for crafting and the kids loved the supplied shapes which were easily used with the sand. Would recommend."
974,282,5," Bought as a gift after seeing it on display in a local toy shop that were out of stock. So clever! Play doh like feel to the sand& encouraging fine motor skills.The box comes with a few small sand toys and is perfect for little hands. Additional sand can be bought to build on this box.The gift was a hit! Perfect Christmas gift"
975,282,5," The children love this it is easy to use and clear up after they have played with it.Adults like it aswell fun to play with Highly recommen this motion sand.The price is cheaper than the shops.I have ordered more from this seller.Delivery was fast 5 days and that was over the easter weekend.Highly recommend seller and the sand"
976,282,4," My daughter loves this. It is still quite messy if you use it indoors though& would suggest it as an outside toy in the summer months. Alternatively I put a plastic tablecloth under her little table to catch the bits that fall off& then shake it outside afterwards."
977,283,4," I bought this to top up a box set of Kinetic sand I had ordered for my daughters birthday. The amount of sand you get is not very good value for money as it isn't the cheapest& but it is so fascinating to touch that you can overlook this! My daughter loves it and I must confess so do I!"
978,283,4," The Kinetic sand came before time& but the box is a lot smaller than what it looks like in the advertised picture& it does seem expensive for what it is basically after carful opening of the box& just a bag of kinetic sand& no castle shape mould  or any other shape mould don't be fooled by the cover if the box& so that is an extra expense for moulds& I am shure my 10 year old Daughter will love it for Christmas& |she was given a tiny set to play with a while ago with a small mould& she loved it as is great to mould and build with&} It needs no adult constant supervision unless you have a younger child that wants to try and eat it& you need to invest as well in what I would suggest in a brand new cheap cat litter tray or similar tray for it to be played with in as this set doesn't come with a tray as others do."
979,283,5," great wonderful stuff kenetic sand.... all 4 of my children 9 and under love it..."
980,283,5," After a mix up on delivery date this eventually arrived. My granddaughter will love playing with this."
981,283,5," Was for my granddaughter she loved it"
982,283,3," You don't get much for your money!!!!"
983,283,5," Arrive on time& lovely colour"
984,284,5," This is another great Djeco set with lot's too do in it. The picture's if done correctly turn out looking great &the bird's are very clear and colourful and their is no waste of sand because every box has a small hole too tip the sand back into the pots. I would highly recommend these set's to all parent's with older girls."
985,284,5," The pictures are very pretty and I love the way the sand is collected in the box so there is no mess. It is straightforward so no adult help required&"
986,284,4," My daughter loves it. We still have the pics made from sand in her room.I think it helps to develop children's patient and attention.Would strongly recommend.Slightly overpriced (that's why 4 stars for seller). This set is not an expensive staff."
987,285,1,""
988,285,2," Awful stuff"
989,285,1," Nothing to store the sand in and the models don't really retain their structure. The sand doesn't stain clothes but doesn't just brush off either. Overall not great considering the price... play-doh is more versatile."
990,285,1," Moulds didn't create good models."
991,285,5," I have no idea how this got a such good rating.The sand in the mould just falls apart as soon as you attempt to open then.So very limited play. And makes quite a mess."
992,285,2," Because the sand doesnâ€™t stain and is non-toxic& it is perfect for being able to play with indoors during the winter when you canâ€™t get to the beach to make proper sandcastles!I did find it relatively mess free and& any mess that was made could be swept up easily though I will only let my children play with it in the dining room where there is no carpet.I liked that the set had a good sized tray included to play with the sand.  There was plenty of space in the trays to make plenty of sculptures and still left plenty of space for them to play with the sand.  I would have liked to have seen lids for the trays to be able to store the sand easier.The quality of the plastic modelling tools provided is great.  The plastic is strong and will stand up to a lot of play.Although Sands Alive claims to look and feel like real sand I donâ€™t really agree.  It definitely feels more like a modelling sand than real sand which is not a bad thing.  It does& however& look more like sand than other sets we have had in the past as it is sand coloured.My 7 year old son found the sand very easy to model both with his hands and with the moulds provided.  My 3 year old daughter struggled a little& though still had fun playing with the sand.The sand came out of the moulds very easily and I was really impressed with how much detail was imprinted onto the sand.Once my son had made the sculptures they did stay standing until he knocked them down to pack the sand away.  The sand does stick together very well.For the price& I think the set is excellent value for money.  You receive plenty of sand and a lot of moulds to play with.Read more â€º"
993,285,1," Does not hold together as i expected. It's more like sand then playdoh."
994,285,5," Very disappointed with this& the animal moulds were made from flimsy plastic& and the modelling sand did not hold its shape as shown on the box cover. The yellow (lion) mould would not join together as both halves were identical! All in all& I cannot recommend this item at all."
995,286,3," The product is good and works well however& my daughter did around 4 pictures and the colours have nearly run out already."
996,286,1,""
997,286,3," Great item& but the pens ran out of ink very quickly making it very expensive for what you get."
998,286,4," 5 year old daughter very pleased. The stencils are a little fiddly for her to set up but other than that for the price it's worth while gift"
999,286,4," My Grandaughter loved this& but was expensive&like every other |Frozen| items !"
1000,286,5," Bought for my niece. Apparently she's using them all the time!"
1001,286,4," Child enjoyed the product aimed at her age range"
1002,286,5," Arrived in good time very pleased with product"
1003,287,4," My daughter was given this as a present at Christmas and she thought it was a lovely idea.  She finally got around to using this at the weekend and has made some beautiful looking creations that she has in pride of place next to her bed.  She has asked for another one for her birthday and also some as birthday pressies for her friends who love what she has shown them.  They kept her quiet for quite a time thinking about how the colours would look best and then finally creating her masterpieces.  The only slight gripe was that the sand settled overnight leaving a gap at the top of each of the bottles and she didn't have any sand left to top them up.  Over time when they get knocked over& they are now going to lose that initial design."
1004,287,4," Good fun. We had a few spillages (as you'd expect with young children) and then ran out of sand for the last bottle.  Could do with a bit more sand"
1005,287,4," Don't glow"
1006,287,4," Good"
1007,288,5," Arrived promptly and will be loved by my daughter who's wanted crazy sand for a while."
1008,288,5," This stuff is fantastic children love it.  Just be very careful if they are prone to rub there eyes makes them sting.  Wash hands after use as it says on packet.  But defo worth the buy...."
1009,288,1," Packet inside was all open so sand was dry. Couldn't send back as the present was from Father Christmas and my son wanted to play with it."
1010,289,5," grandson loves it"
1011,290,5," Having asked for and received a Red one of course I was delighted and I thank the supplier for this.I purchased this car for a 14 year old boy for his birthday who fell in love with it immediately and more delighted that he could put it together himself"
1012,290,4," Brought this for my son for his birthday and he liked it so much I have got another model for christmas. It seemed easy to put together"
1013,290,5," This was bought for a 10 year old& who started assembling it as soon as it was opened& he loved it and it is well made and pretty impressive when built."
1014,290,5," My son recieved this for Christmas and it looked brilliant& he started building the model straight away. He needed some help of his Uncle but finally they finished the 458 Italia& the alloys are customizable and look really cool. The model takes 15-60 mins and is really good fun.Maisto have a brilliant assembly of kit cars& especially Ferrari. My son is desperate to add more cars to his collection because he had already built a 599 Fiorano before this product was given to him.Fantastic model!!!"
1015,290,5," cool model easy to build great price will order again from this retailer the extra wheels help to change the look easy to change"
1016,290,5," Really good detail and easy to assemble. I have several good model cars and would recommend this one. Excellent value."
1017,290,5," Pretty easy to assemble and end result is fantastic.Have now started to collect other models in this range with a view to having a smart looking display"
1018,290,4," My 10 year old son really enjoyed building this - a little bit of help required from me but not too much!"
1019,291,5," This is one of Mattel's 1:50 scale 1966 BATMAN vehicle line and as such has caused a bit of a stir among the fans.  The last time a Batboat  had been available had been the 60/70s with CORGI and their strangely coloured boats.This attempt to recreate it is much better.  It is still not quite correct but on the whole it is very nice indeed& with its own trailer included.Very smart addition to the range and a favourite with the fans.  Now all we need is a 1:18 version to fit with the car!"
1020,291,4," Somehow my 3 year old hasn't event broken the trailer after 6 months.  Just a pity that the batmobile we have doesn't have a tow bar to pull this.My 3"

1037,302,5," Very good"
1038,303,5," very cool will be ordering more cheers thanks"
1039,304,4," A neat little model of one of my favourite cars. Nice display box to keep the dust off. Good detailing despite the small size. More of a collector's item than a toy& given the cost (which I think is fairly reasonable).I notice it's currently unavailable& seems I was lucky to find one when I did.A pity Burago or a similar manufacturer don't offer a larger-scale version of the Bentley - the old Airfix kit is still around but costs serious money these days!"

1049,311,5," I wanted to get a good quality& solid& durable car transporter for my 3 year old boy. I ordered a cheaper one first& but was very disappointed because it was quite light and fragile. I returned it and got this one. Would highly recommend. Has great detail also& and is very realistic."
1050,311,5," I bought this transporter for my son's 4th birthday and he was thrilled with it. It is very solid and realistic looking. So far it has lasted for 6 months without any broken parts which is highly unusual for my children. Even my 2 year old hasn't managed to damage it yet!I thought it was very expensive when I first looked at it but so far it seems money well spent."
1051,311,5," My grandson is a fanatic on car transporters& so I searched for what I felt was the best toy representation on offer. I came up with the Siku 1:55 car transporter. On inspection I found it to be very detailed in every aspect and also importantly very robust as this will not be a collectors item but a toy to be played with. I thought the price was a bit high but then I wanted the best so I was willing to purchase it."
1052,311,5," I bought this transporter after doing some research"
1053,311,5," I was very impressed with how sturdy this toy was& my grandson loves this& hes only two and is able to take it apart and put together easily. A bit expensive but very well made!"
1054,311,5," This is a strong and appealing toy for any child with a passion for cars and the transportation of them.  Providing you keep it on the ground.  But what child doesn't want to lift it up and carry it around.  This is when the lever disengages and the cabin comes away from the transport section.  It is quite tricky for a four year old to put it back and understand the concept that transporters must remain and be re-hooked& on the ground.  This also applies to turning corners& the transporter doesn't make it in one go the tendency is for the child to lift up the cabin section and turn it more - again the transporter comes unhooked.  Despite this it was a huge success and I am sure my grandson will sort out the lever problem."
1055,311,5," Although a little on the expensive side& this truck is very detailed and feels very well made and durable. I purchased this for my 4 year old grandson and I just know he will love it. Overall& a good buy !"
1056,311,4," This is a good quality product and worth the cÂ£20 price tag.However it is 1:50 scale& not the 1:55 quoted in the listing.  Important if you are buying matching cars."
1057,312,5," great thank you"
1058,313,5," Accurate overall shape but crudely detailed model in the large 1/43 scale& but also very cheap. Not detailed enough for the serious bus collector and not really strong enough for child to play with."
1059,314,5," excellent car arrived quick and good value"
1060,314,5," Exactly as presented in the images!"
1061,314,5," good"
1062,315,5," Excellent model. Good weight and good detail. Being a bit of a model maker& I have detailed and weathered it a bit myself. But this is not necessary. Great as it is."
1063,316,5," He loved it!"
1064,317,5," Bought as a visual reference for the building of a bigger model. Sufficient detail for my needs and nicely presented for display."

1068,320,5," My 2 year old nephew loves this. I was a little worried about small parts on this as he is only 2 but it is very sturdy and I kept the two little bumper attachments off.  He absolutely loves it. Huge thumbs up!  His mum and dad approved too."
1069,320,3," Good fun toy fairly strong BUT could not get the cab off to remove batteries as fixed one side what ever we did. needed to do this as taking abroad for a present. did not return as no time before we left. Kids loved it."
1070,320,5," I find these brilliant. Strong and sturdy. Definitely better quality than the over priced bruder toys. I have one from 7 years ago and its still in tact."

1075,323,5," I purchased this for a Christmas Present.  It was received with much pleasure.  Thank you again for coming up trumps!"
1076,324,5," I bought this product by accident&  beware of the |buy with one click| facility &as I brushed this by accident next thing I know I'm getting an email saying your product has been dispatched& anyway I've always wanted this model to finalise my collection but trying to justify the cost& but once I had opened the box I had to keep it and maybe ironically by doing it this way was the only chance of getting this model then worry about affording later."

1100,336,5," I bought this model because my father had a 1934 Riley Kestrel and I just wanted a reminder of it. For a female to buy a model car is unusual but this is small enough to keep in my study and because it is so small& I am the only one who can actually see it!It was value for money as far as I am concerned and comes in a neat little plastic display box."

Of all of my collection& I think that the orange coloured Koenigsegg CCX is probably the most stunning& you might want to take a look at one on the MiniModels website if it's not currently available from Amazon.It's always worth price-checking between the Amazon and MiniModels websites& if you're looking to buy a high quality diecast vehicle.Thank you for taking the time to read this review."

1107,342,4," I like this car it is a gift for someone who loves Porsche cars. I was surprised how small it was though I thought it was going to big bigger. It is beautiful and in it's case&. I would buy again from this company and would recommend to my friends."

1117,346,5," excellent"
1118,346,4," good"
1119,347,4," Nice model and quite detailed however anyone who ever owned the real thing would know the Pop only had one driver's side windscreen wiper fitted and it was black. This model has two wipers painted in bright silver paint which look totally wrong."
1120,347,4," this ford popular of 1939 is a nice ittle car one of the BEST in my railway/model room have you got Aeroplane mag july 26 1946? Avro tudor 2.i can not get in on amazon.ford popular 1953-62 the FORD PREFECT 1938-49.i have 2 on my RAILWAY if you buy this car you will love it..!"
1121,347,5," Smaller than I hoped for& but beautiful and well made.  I love the fact it reminds me of my father who had one of these models when I was a child. Fast service which added to the enjoyment. Thank you."
1122,347,5," Quality is very good and works well with OO gauge."
1123,347,5," Very good but why do they never add drivers?"
1124,348,5," Arrived very promptly was just what I wanted really pleased"
1125,349,5," This is a very heavy& great model of an Audi & however we did have to glue the wing mirror back on and roof rails as they fell off but may have just been a one off .  It came quickly and was exactly as explains"
1126,350,5," Great"
1127,351,5," This nice little diecast model of the President's limousine is very well presented in a nice display box and appears to be very well made. Considering the price& this a fantastic buy. It's definitely intended more as a display piece than an action toy& although the doors are openable& but would stand up to a fair bit of abuse if played with I'm sure."
1128,352,5," Love this product. Looks so good."
1129,353,5," This is such a solidly made toy â€“ and lots of fun. This kit has pride of place amongst our kids' Brio collection."
1130,353,5," My son got this as a present.  It's really excellent quality.  The battery operated loco is a great addition to his train sets - it can just about get up the sloped rail bits that he already has with two or three trucks attached& but on the flat it will pull several trucks."
1131,353,5," Due to my kind of work our boys love ships and it is so hard to find anything that is as educational and good quality as this product. Brio should expand on this range!"
1132,353,5," This is a fantastic toy and will continue to be for years to come.  There are so many parts for your child to play with.  So happy I bought this for my boat and train mad son.  What's great about this is it is stand alone& ie you could buy this and there are some pieces of track with it& although it is better if you have some track already.  My 3 year old and I love the magnetic cargo that the crane can raise and lower into the ships hold.  So sturdy and well crafted.  You won't regret buying this."
1133,353,5," Grandchildren love playing with this: pretty much bulletproof.  Good interface between brio and other toys"
1134,353,5," well packaged& promptly delivered& lovely toy& would order again"
1135,353,5," Well built toy and much enjoyed by my two young grandsons."
1136,354,5," as described for static scenic model"
1137,354,5," great gift"
1138,354,4," ok"
1139,355,4," I have several Classix models and find them very well detailed considering their size. Still looking for the Austin BRS parcels van."
1140,356,5," Son happy with it although a bit expensive"
1141,357,5," Excellent service& and the detail in the kit."
1142,358,5," This is a beautiful model& detailed& showing off the gorgeous modified Lincoln Futura at her best. Even before this lovely concept car became the iconic Batmobile she typified the American luxury cruiser of the time& with fins you could shave on as they say!But back to this model in particular. I am in my fifties and used to watch Batman on TV in the sixties& when this car was as much a star of the show as Adam West.  This model is the largest of the three I have - I only have the small Hot Wheels and Eaglemoss version from the magazine& but this is the most beautiful& she has the racing type steering wheel and even the fire extinguisher in the cab.She has pride of place in my small collection. To anyone who really likes Batman or loves the Batmobile I say& buy this model"
1143,358,3," It's actually Okay& but thats it. For the price I paid& it's fine. It's on the borderline of being Toy/Model. Not a patch on the Corgi models which really are the benchmark. I've got some of the small 1/48 scale Hot wheels models and they look much more realistic. It's quite big& for a nostalga buff it would make a great pressie."
1144,358,5," Fantastic value for money for this amazing replica of the 1960s batmobile such an iconic vehicle great detail and a good scale worth the Â£20 price"
1145,358,5," This is the 2nd batmobile I now have and I ordered this based on how good the first one was. It's a good size and the quality is very good to."
1146,358,5," this is a great looking model& of the  original Batmobile  Mattel Hot Wheels have did a great job at bringing us this Classic..."
1147,358,5," Brilliant well made and just as I remembered it when I was a young child"
1148,358,5," Blow me! This is an excellent model at an excellent price."
1149,358,5," Beautiful model. An asset to any collection."
1150,359,5," Fast turnaround& keen pricing"
1151,360,4," good product"
1152,360,5," ok"

1155,362,5," Good service nice product"
1156,363,5," Exactly what I wanted to give a friend for Christmas as I couldn't afford the real thing.  Despatched and arrived as expected."

1168,370,5," Iâ€™m a very long term and very devoted collector of AutoArt diecast models& either bought from the MiniModels website& or else from Amazon& and my girlfriend always gives me a model as a present on my Birthday& at Christmas& and for our anniversaries.I have a  few dozen cars in my collection now& including this particularly stunning Porsche. The AutoArt models which I own all have the following qualities in common. They are exacting in their attention to detail& both the exterior and interior& and are made from very high quality materials which give a good tactile experience& even the rubber tyres are nice to touch. The alloys look great and the paintwork is vibrant and eye catching. The models are quite heavy and need to be handled with care.I bought my first AutoArt model car about six years ago and it still looks as good today as the day I opened the packaging. The one Achilles Heel with these quality models& is the windscreen wipers& which can snag on a cleaning cloth if you're dusting them and get accidentally damaged. I stupidly made that mistake once (and just the once!)& with the burgundy coloured and gold wheeled Michael Mann limited edition of the Ferrari 599.The prudent and best thing to do is to exhibit your cherished model inside a display case or cabinet& keeping it free from dust and finger grease. You can buy a suitable plastic or wooden display case for this model& either here from Amazon& or else from the MiniModels website.I take immense pleasure in looking at my collection of AutoArt models at home& which now includes a fleet of Porsche 911's& several Bugatti Veyrons& a Koenigsegg CCX& a Pagani Huayra& and very many different types of Lamborghinis and Ferraris.Read more â€º"
1169,371,5," My son drove a Green Goddess during the fireman's strike many years ago when he was in the navy and was highly delighted with the model I gave him as a joke Christmas presentA beautiful model and arrived in time for Christmas.."
1170,371,5," This present was for a gift"
1171,371,5," Great model - sent me back to the days I instructed soldiers how to use one"
1172,371,5," son`s xmas present he loves it"
1173,372,5," At first I thought that what detailing can there be in 1:64 aspect...but you'll be surprised !!!It's reeks quality from every angle and a must buy for children&adults and enthusiasts alike."
1174,373,5," very good detail bought cos im rebuilding katana 750 so this model gave me an idea of what bits went were did the job just great well pleased"
1175,374,5," Superly detailed Oxford model of an iconic British commercial vehicle& wonderful"
1176,374,5," A1"
1177,375,5," Good value for money as it will take sometime to paint and build. I think it is more for the older child - 14 upwards. I bought it for my 8yr old planning to build it together - I've nearly finished all on my own...  The painting gives the final effect of the model and is quite fiddly to get anywhere near perfect. Great that this kit has all the paints& glue and brushes. Ideally the main body of the car needs airbrushing which is more equipment to buy& but not that much if you plan to do other models afterwards. Good fun if you have the patience. Every boy should make at least one Airfix kit in their lifetime and an Aston is a good marque to start on !"
1178,375,5," Took a while to arrive due to christmas post problems and the snow.Arrived with damage to the box&assumed this was from Royal Mail though.However bought it as a present for my brother and he is thrilled with the product. Very fiddly as all models are& more for the teenager/slightly mature generation"
1179,375,5," My best mate is physically disabled so I try to give him presents that will both interest him and give him something to keep his hands and mind busy. He tells me that this is the business."
1180,375,4," My son loves this. I wanted to purchase something which would occupy the mind of an 8 year old instead of the xbox and this has done the job. My son cannot get enough of this buy and wants a few more. Gets him off the xbox."
1181,375,5," Bought for my son who wanted something to do other than be on computer in evenings. He is in his 30s and loved these kits when little& and not knowing what to buy& this was just the answer."
1182,375,4," This was bought as a gift. Its recipient loved it very much.  I had been disappointed that the completed car was smaller than I expected& this is why I've given it four stars!It was a great gift and its size doesn't put me off buying more in the future!  My Nephew has already asked for one for Christmas!"
1183,375,3," Great product.  Lots of details and simple picture instructions.  Have to work with your children to build it.  My child was 8 but he seemed to enjoy it."
1184,375,5," I bought this for my daughter for christmas she is 12 and it only took her a day and half to do it& she had fun making it so I would recommend this."

1186,377,5," It a perfect model"
1187,378,5," A first-rate model. Highly recommended"
1188,378,4," just as expected"
1189,379,5," Top quality London 2012 taxi depicting one of the olympic game events.  Every little boy's dream& or indeed anyone who wants to start collecting.  They are the antique toys of the future.  Exactly as described& comes in its own individual box with the information of the games.  I collect them for my grandson but I have to admit I get a real buz sending for them myself.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them.  The service is excellent and delivery only a few days."
1190,380,5," satisfied with product"
1191,380,5," EXCELLENT"
1192,381,5," My son really loves this model tractor to add to his collection.  Note this is not a toy for children."
1193,382,5," Arrived before Xmas which wasn't expected because it was ordered (we thought) too late. Looks exactly like the picture. Son was impressed with this gift."
1194,383,4," was a gift and very much appreciated"
1195,384,5," very nice quality"
1196,384,4," very good product"
1197,385,5," surprised at size but still happy with model"
1198,386,5," My son loves his Disney Cars collection and plays with them everyday. They're a good quality die cast toy that can withstand a 4 year old boy! The paint car chip with rough use& but the cars seem indestructible."
1199,386,5," Excellent couldn't get this one to add to my grandsons cars collection. Arrived quickly and good value for money."
1200,386,5," EXCELLENT CAR TO ADD TO MY GRANDSONS COLLECTION. IT IS TO BE PART OF HIS BIRTHDAY PRESENT"
1201,387,5," I send a few periodically to my grandson who is 6years old.  He is very much into cars.  I tell him to keep the boxes as they will be collectors items of the future and will be worth more in their original boxes.  Corgi produce a good product.  They are exactly as advertised& delivered well within the expected delivery dates and very well packed.  Very good cars to collect."
1202,388,5," This Corgi model brought the memories flooding back - both the model and the packaging evoke memories of 1965 when every young boy wanted this model for Christmas and the original won |Toy of the Year| award. This version is produced in silver rather than the gold finish of the original model but nonetheless it still features revolving number plates& an ejector seat& bullet proof shield and machine guns etc. evoking memories of the original Corgi model I remember. The quality of the model itself is good& although& the balance that has been struck is making it true to the original model from the 60s rather than updating it& therefore& in some ways it falls short of the level of detail in some of today's models.A couple thousand of the gold versions have also been produced by Corgi but are in short supply and command a significant premium - this version is certainly the next best thing. If it's any consolation the actual car in the Goldfinger movie was silver& but at the time Corgi are said to have thought that if they produced it in silver it might look unfinished& hence the original model being gold.  I can assure you this 2015 silver version of the model certainly looks finished. Recommended."
1203,388,5," missed out on the original& so glad I got this one"
1204,388,5," corgi toys missed the 50th anniversary of james bond in 2012 but catch up with the 50th anniversary of Goldfinger! this is a great die cast to be collected by all means! and i love that vintage box!"
1205,388,5," good value collectable ... just like original 60s .... son loves it ."
1206,388,5," got it ok"
1207,388,3," I used to own the original and I appreciate memories of youth are questionable& however the quality of this replica doesn't seem to compare with my memories of the original."
1208,388,4," Had one of the these as a child& which I wrecked!  This model is almost identical - original had red extendable wheel hubs.  This is a great addition to my JB collection& well packaged and very detailed. Would have been 5 stars but one of the rotating number plates has been put on upside down. Excellent value nevertheless."
1209,388,5," I like this model a great deal. I am quite a Corgi Buff and this one is up there with the best and i know i've got every version you can imagine! The model arrived very quicky on standard delivery and was packaged well. So all is good& the price was quite competitive and fair too considering  the increasing scarcity of this gunmetal grey version (challenge yourself to get a gold one!).All the features seem to work more efficiently than the original Corgi version back from 1966. The baddie and secret instructions are still present in this new version and i love the box& well done Corgi with the little surprise when you pull the model box from the outer package.OK so i'm away to eject the baddie from 007's Aston Martin DB5& activate the machine guns and bring up the bullet-proof shield..."
1210,389,3," it is a nice Harley but I needed to take it out the box as a few bits had fell off"
1211,389,5," Excellent"
1212,389,4," Well boxed esay to open"
1213,390,5," Excellent all rounÄ"
1214,391,5," Got for my husband for Christmas as he is building a train station"
1215,391,5," Quick delivery and nicely boxed"
1216,392,5," Great prod"
1217,393,5," Brilliant..thank you"
1218,394,5," This moto gp model bike is exellent value for the price and the detail on it is great& it's not a toy for children to play with but a good model for a collector."
1219,395,5," great as I thought"
1220,396,5," Arrived within a few days& and according to my brother in law& its perfect thank you. It was for his Birthday. So I would definitely recommend them again. Thank you.[...]"
1221,396,5," chose this product as my husband loves American trucks exspecialy with all the chrome work.he gets a lot of enjoyment"
1222,396,4," Bought as a pressie for a friend.  Looked fab on the box but obviously will take him some time to make it !!"
1223,397,5," My son always wants 007 model cars for Christmas and they can be difficult to find in shops& especially particular ones from certain films. It's easier than ever to find them online at Amazon& no trudging round for hours and driving from town to town wasting petrol!"
1224,398,5," my old bus company"
1225,399,5," I have never had any problems with this manufacturer& the paintwork and detail are of the usual great quality."
1226,400,4," Good quality.  As I expected and hoped it would be"
1227,401,5," Just what it's meant to be"
1228,402,5," Very good models& thank you."
1229,403,5," Great quality and many components made of plastic & die cast body and chassis& rubber tires& the trailer and the timber are made of plastic. The scale for this toy is 1:87."
1230,403,5," THE WOOD ON THESE TRUCKS IS HELD IN POSTITION BY A PLASTIC BAND WHICH CAN BE CUT FOR THE WOOD TO BE REMOVED AND A DIFFERENT LOAD TO TAKE ITS PLACE HOWEVER THE LOAD WOULD BE UNSECURED."
1231,403,3," BIT ON THE SMALL SIDE"
1232,404,5," Purchased for a friend as a present & very happy with the gift."
1233,405,5," The model is of the usual brilliant standard by IXO. Good detail and also the paintwo0rk and decals are first class. The only problem is that the model is screwed to the plinth and is difficult to remove & so I can put it on either a diorama or into my model cabinet."
1234,406,5," Very good models& thank you."
1235,407,5," Great Deal.Thanks"
1236,408,5," Lovely model car 'just married' a novelty gift and very well received.  Nice change to the traditional wedding present gifts"
1237,409,3," Thought I was getting a bargain& but it was too good to be true! Falsely advertised as 'matchbox set of twenty random cars/models'& in yellow boxes.  I received twenty 'maisto' cars/models in blue/black boxes!  Really disappointed as you would of thought from the item description that they would in fact be MATCHBOX cars/models!  I thought I was going mad so I even double checked my order history and indeed the item claimed to be matchbox cars/models......quite clearly these were NOT the make I received!"
1238,409,5," 20 match box cars for just over Â£1 each? Cannot go wrong. I saw one review that said they werent match bowlx. But these definitley are.Im thinking of buying some more just to give for good behaviour& nearly as cheap as sweets"
1239,409,5," These are great quality Matchbox cars. I didn't receive any identical cars and in fact I was surprised to receive everything from a police motorbike and a fire engine to normal street cars and jeeps. My 3 year old loves them!"
1240,409,5," Thought I had a bargain but then I found you could buy the same at ASDA for a pound a care buying 20 at once cost almost Â£1.50 a car so more than a little dissappointed!"
1241,409,5," ordered this for my grandson's birthday and he loved it - there were so many cars/vans/lorries in the set i was able to keep some back for his Christmas present as little extra's too. brilliant"
1242,409,5," These car selection was indeed random& but beware they are not made of matchboxes& but a sturdy metal construction. Will last several years using this new construction method."

1244,411,5," Its a brilliantly painted& model of an actual Japanese Train& as for my 5 year old  its a Red/yellow Train just like on TV.It works on the Tomy Tracks and also on the wooden floor too.Perfect addition to the Tomy Tracks and trains my son has already and easily hooks up with the other trains so he can mix and match them.If you child likes trains and has Tomy Tracks or equal size ones& then I would get it as the detail is remarkable for a childs toy."
1245,411,5," My grandson loved it"
1246,411,5," As pictured"
1247,412,4," The display case was received with a fracture in it."

1256,417,4," Very good display piece . excellent detail and molding . Only problems limited articulation and no bike . Also very cool base"
1257,418,4," Slightly smaller than the product dimensions but nothing drastic. Cheaper here than on eBay or anywhere else. Well worth it."

1262,419,5," good quality toy. My 5 year old son loves it. I got Hulk and Iron Man figures as well."

1267,420,5," Hasbro continue their releases of 2008's Complete Saga collection with a wave of figures devoted entirely to this year's new Star Wars computer game - The Force Unleashed. Figure #10 is an Imperial Jumptrooper.Jumptroopers are specialised armoured Stormtroopers with jet packs which allow them to fly through the air in short bursts and attack ground targets with their rail detonator guns.Hasbro have gone a stage further with figure creation this year and have added extra joints and movements to their figures for even greater poseability. The paint and detailing on the figure is excellent and several if these look very cool together.The Jumptrooper has head (rotational and vertical - the rebreather tubes does come out of the chest plate)& shoulder (rotational and abductional)& elbow (rotational and vertical)& wrist (rotational)& torso (rotational)& hip (rotational)& knee (rotational and vertical) and ankle (rotational and vertical) joints giving him a massive 24 movements of articulation.He comes equipped with a black rail detonator rifle which looks very much like an E-11 rifle and there is a personalised figure stand which is the same design that we had in the 2006 The Saga Collection line.The only criticism of this figure I have is that it does not include the jet pack! For a Jumptrooper& this is kind of essential and considering the equipment included with other figures it seems strange to miss this out.Each figure in this wave comes with one of four randomly packed cheat codes for The Force Unleashed game.A great looking trooper and a must have for those dioramas."
1268,421,5," Bought this figure as a present for my nephew. The first one never arrived due to the Royal Mail but when I contacted the vendor by e-mail they immediately offered a replacement or a refund. I took up the replacement and that arrived very quickly so full marks for the customer service. The replacement is a Eldar Spiritseer so hopefully my nephew will enjoy it equally. It arrives boxed and un-painted so I couldn't comment on assembly and painting but from what I hear that is half the fun."
1269,422,4," The pictures are great  I would say it was medium large book not megaBut still good value for any child who is a fan they will love it"
1270,422,4," I bought this for my 5 year old Nephew who loves anything TMNT. Great item. Great price. I bought this alongside the TMNT Stationary Set. Ideal stocking fillers for Xmas."
1271,422,4," Would please any Ninja Turtles fan such as my 6 yr old grandson! The pics are quite detailed so there is scope to improve your colouring skills. Good way to master pencil strokes and can only help with handwriting in a fun way."
1272,422,5," I've bought many of the |mega colouring| range and they provide tons of colouring and sticking fun for children of all ages. Perfect for the car& travel or those wet days stuck indoors"
1273,422,2," I thought the word | mega | was a bit misleading...I thought it was this massive colouring book but turned out to A4 size which I could have bought out a shop"
1274,422,1," I was quite disappointed with the colouring book for the price. The print wasn't very clear. If it hadn't been a gift I would've sent it back."
1275,422,3," Arrived on time& but its Ok! Bit disappointed in it. Gift for my nephew but if I'd seen in the shop I wouldn't have purchased."
1276,422,5," I bought this for my 5 year old grandson. Looks as though he could spend hours colouring in. Definitely will keep him busy."
1277,423,5," As with all  Playmobil sets& we were impressed with the quality and detail in these sets. We'd been waiting for the Fairy sets to become more widely available and were not disappointed when we finally got some!The fairies themselves are just beautiful& the animals are just magical. We have a large collection of  Playmobil& so love being able to add new animals& character and accessories. These fitted in well with our previously purchased sets. The Unicorna in these sets are just gorgeous. Makes me want to be little again!"
1278,423,4," Only given four stars because it's a Christmas present so I can't comment on its durability etc yet. However if it is up to the usual playmobil standards& there won't be any issues. One thing I dislike about playmobil is if you open the boxes& you can't close them again& they are kind of glued shut. This means I can't open the box and have a look& and also means my kids can't put the set back in the box when they've finished playing. This being said& the price was a bargain so I can't complain. It looks a nice size too. Would be perfectly acceptable to give to someone as a present. will hopefully make a nice addition to our playmobil sets."
1279,423,5," My Daughter absolutely loved this.  Arrived quickly& well wrapped and has give my daughter hours of fun.  Very fiddly to put together for a five year old and you need an adult with patience to put it all together - there are lots of very tiny little bits. Good quality."
1280,423,5," Purchased as a present& you can't go wrong with playmobil can you! Great value for money& quality and the children love it"
1281,423,5," My Grandaughter enjoyed the Carriage very much over Christmas."
1282,423,4," think the little will love them . they are Christmas presants"
1283,423,4," Figures actually look bigger on the box& but very nice item."
1284,423,5," Great product& my daughter loves playing with playmobil"
1285,424,4," I received this toy for Christmas and here's my review it was a cool character it's box had lots of pictures of him in movies his accessories were well detailed he had lots of points of articulation. I would have preferred if S.H monsterarts made a version of him based on the movie godzilla mothra and king ghidorah giant monsters all out attack. Who made that title"
1286,424,4," Good detail and comes with mini house trees and horse.  My daughter really likes this and I really liked the price."
1287,425,5," Christmas present but great u can buy funkos theme of magic the gathering so much detail"
1288,425,5," Bought this as a gift& quick delivery and great quality :)"
1289,425,4," Quick delivery& and item was as described"
1290,426,5," Fast delivery and exactly what I was after ðŸ‘"
1291,426,5," Noice"
1292,427,5," Arrived on time.. Great figure."
1293,428,5," Excellent toys& my 4 year old loves them. Nice and sturdy too."
1294,428,4," Fun models& received quickly and competitively priced."
1295,428,5," Perfect addition to his collection.. Good price also"
1296,428,5," Good product. Arrived quickly"
1297,428,5," good product. quick delivery"
1298,428,5," Perfect& as pictured"
1299,429,5," Could not be any happier. Delivery time was good and model looks fantastic."
1300,430,5," Bought as a gift for my nephew.. He will love it.. was a great price!"
1301,430,5," very good value fast delivery"
1302,431,5," I bought this Carl Grimes figure for myself as I am a massive TWD fan& and I wanted ones of my favourite characters. This is awesome and so cute! Definitely a must have for any fan x"
1303,431,3," It's super cute& but the paint is all a bit iffy. The black of one of the eyes has dripped down and the pink of the hand has gone onto the keys among other things. I wouldn't usually mind& but it's a present for a friend& but it's still a good present nether the less."
1304,431,5," As I am in my 40's I wouldn't call it a |toy| but a figure! The quality and attention to detail is excellant ."
1305,431,5," Sooooo Goooood bought this for a friends birthday& although slow delivery& its very good quality"
1306,431,5," This is brilliant. Addicted to walking dead so going to collect them all."
1307,431,5," A great addition to my walking dead pop vinyl collection"
1308,431,5," Bought as a present& the child absolutely loved it."
1309,431,4," Took a long time to arrive but very happy"
1310,432,5," My grandson aged 3 absolutely adores this toy.  It arrived in perfect condition and well within the promised delivery time quoted. Definitely a thumbs up . Thank you."
1311,432,5," Brought this for our sons 2nd birthday a while back now it's still his favourite toy and mine. Have never changed batteries and played with lots"
1312,432,5," Great toy! My son loves it! Lots of different phrases and actions! He plays with it everyday!"
1313,432,5," So good as brought it on sale and my son birthday he love it ðŸ˜€"
1314,432,4," It big & son as not seen it yet but he will love it"
1315,432,5," My Grandson loves Leonardo and this is a great toy."
1316,433,4," This is without a doubt the best classic predator you can buy& but I gave it four stars because the hip joints are very loose. That is really the only downside but you can fix it by looking online. If your looking for the predator from the first movie this is the best version."
1317,433,5," The product arrived within the given time& the figure is of very good quality& I shall be buying further figures& the only query I found was the packaging& it was in a suitable box& but only about a dozen small pieces of polystyrene as packing& which did nothing to stop the goods bouncing around in the outer box& would have been better using newspaper or similar& but no big deal& nothing was damaged& I like products that arrive within the given dates& Good Service&Thank YouPete"
1318,434,4," I do like this rendition of Superboy Prime.  It would have been better if a variant was released without the Anti Monitor armour so we have an unarmoured version available.  Strangely& he is slightly taller than my Superman New 52 Mattel figure.  I wasn't even aware of this until I posed them both on the shelf.  Good figure though."
1319,435,5," good i need more and more kind of products of ultraman excellent i love it . perfect toy i like it"
1320,436,4," Bot Shots seem to be the latest craze amongst the under-tens age group and are thoroughly loved by both my four and nine year old sons. They are surprisingly small plastic Transformer toys and can easily fit into the palm of a child's hand& so you don't seem to get a great deal for your money! That said& these Bot Shots seem to be fairly robust which is useful as they are intended to be smashed into each other and into different surfaces& so they do need to withstand quite a lot of rough play. The unique feature of these particular transformers is that they automatically transform from their vehicle mode on any impact and turn themselves into the robot figure& which is quite impressive& certainly to my kids. They are also very easy to transform back into vehicles& even by the youngest of children.The fun game that the Bot Shots can be used for is similar to the concepts of Top Trumps and Rock& Paper& Scissors. Each little figure has a tiny dial to select one of three options (Fist& Sword& Blaster) before crashing into another figure. The figure with the 'best' weapon is the winner. If both players have selected the same option& then the player with the highest value wins. (My explanation probably sounds far more complex than the game actually is! It's certainly a concept that my four year old is able to understand easily and one game that the two brothers are able to play together without arguments!)The main disadvantage is that to play the game& you do need to buy at least two of these figures which works out very expensive for what you actually get. It is possible to buy these Bot Shots in sets of three which are slightly better value for money although those sets seem quite difficult to get hold of currently."
1321,437,5," This bad boy is my first purchase from Series 2 of the classic Planet of the Apes figures from NECA. Ursus is the leader of the gorilla military from the second Apes film& Beneath The Planet Of The Apes. The sculpt is spot on& the detail in his costume is just fantastic from his signature helmet to his armoured chestplate. You get his revolver and a machine gun& the revolver can be kept in his holster. Add a couple of soldiers from Series 1 and you have the beginnings of a mighty army. If you have so much as a passing interest in these films& buy this before they go and treble in price. You won't be disappointed."
1322,437,5," |I'll tell you one thing every good soldier knows. The only good human is a dead human|. General Ursus is a fabulous creation. A crass manipulative gangster and politician& brought to life by James Gregory for the first Apes sequel& Beneath& No small player in the events immediately preceding the end of the world& it is fitting there should be a fully poseable action figure of him. NECA's creation is really excellent on all levels. The likeness is perfect and highly detailed& He is easily able to stand& and the accessories appropriate& and accurate. Amen."
1323,437,5," Neca have created the most accurate Ape figures  ever released and Ursus is  no exeption.It's very accurate indeed with a great paintjob"
1324,437,4," NICE ONE."
1325,438,4," I love to collect batman memorabilia& so condition is a major thing to me. The item itself is brilliant& fine detail and looks fantastic with the rest of the series. My only problem is the way it was delivered& the card is now bent so doesn't look right as it wasn't properly packaged& when I previously ordered the Harley Quinn one it was fine. Gutted"
1326,438,5," I have a large collection of Batman collectibles and this is by far one of my favourites.  Excellent sculpt and paintwork.  Figures are less than 4|s so be aware the |l'il| is more than just reference to the L'il Gotham books."
1327,439,5," As it's been said and you can see in any video review this is an incredibly detailed figure with a photogenic likeness to 'Brian Cranston' as 'Walter White' after watching the entire series of 'Breaking Bad' in high definition it's incredible to see how much attention to detail 'NECA' put into the sculpt and paint job to the point they got almost every wrinkle on 'Cranston's' face included accurately and the head and face sculpted to a near perfect likeness.The rest of the figure is also very well detailed with 'NECA' doing a fantastic job creating a rippled Hazmat suit that looks realistic and ripples/folds as it would on an actual person in that stance and the classic moccasin shoes that he wore throughout the series being given the same treatment.The figure comes in a classic cardboard window box like the action figures you collected as a kid which had a nice element of nostalgia and 3 accessory's which are a 'Breather mask' (which i should note does not fit onto the head but can be placed into his hand)"
1328,439,5," Very good quality& paint job superb no visible flaws on the figure i received.Comes with 2 flasks& but its hard to fit the conical one in his hands but not a major issue.Can also place the gas mask on his face and in his hand& glasses are removable and well done.Only complaint is lack of articulation i.e. there is none but that is to be expected since this is a display figure not an action figure.Good value for the price highly recommended for enthusiasts of the show"
1329,439,5," Very cool figure - a must-have for Breaking Bad merchandise collectors! not going to unwrap it though& it is very cool as it is. Most staisfied!"
1330,439,5," It's packed very well and looks exactly the way it is described"
1331,440,5," very good little action figure here& was mainly a stocking filler for birthday. but boy was i wrong. amazing quality& usualy the legs on these things only have the joints in the hips but this batman has joint in the knees to so he kneels well meaning the child can get more fun&i found the bendier ones can be played with in more ways. riding certain cars or planes the children might havegood buy& would recomend"
1332,440,5," Out of all the presents my son got for Christmas- this was his favorite.It was a little smaller than I expected but it is actually ideal for little hands playing.  Ideal for taking in the car and out and about stored in the rucksack till you need to keep little cherubs entertained.We lost the first one and he was so upset we had to buy a second one- then we found the first one a couple of weeks later so we have Two batmen- which has thrilled him even more!! :)Great quality& sturdy item!"
1333,440,2," Much small than I expected& so for the price it is very expensive"
1334,440,5," I am very pleased with the batman figure. Good size figure for my son who is four. with quick delivery. i am happy with the figure. will make a great xmas presant."
1335,440,5," TBH if i saw this toy in the shop for the same price i would`nt have bought it& i thought it would be better& but it is what it is and my son is happy with it& so at the end of the day it has done it`s job& very happy with the delivery time....."
1336,440,5," Grandson loves this"
1337,441,5," You can't beat Tomy when it comes to Pokemon figures both for play or display. Super cute and very durable!"
1338,442,5," Easily the best Battle Droid yet. The detail is fantastic& that truly separates it from its predecessors Hasbro has made. And once again& good articulation. If only Hasbro would make more figures that matched THIS figures quality& instead of the crap-poorly made fabric robes/cloaks they put on average Jedi/Sith figures.But honestly& pick up this figure. There is literally nothing wrong with it."
1339,442,5," They really are skeletal& but the oohs& and ahhs have it as they were what the Grandson asked specially for and once assembled he was made up with them( he needed two).  He was very happy."
1340,442,3," The product itself is very good& a detailed action figure. However the box was badly damaged as the packaging it was delivered in was not strong enough to protect it. Not a major problem for me as I don't keep the cards& I know many people keep and collect the card part of the packaging so would not have been happy about the condition it arrived in."
1341,442,5," good"
1342,443,5," Want set 2 now"
1343,444,5," Perfect!"
1344,445,4," This product is very good. It is very robust and is good image of the character."
1345,446,5," Hasbro continue to celebrate Star Wars' 30th Anniversary with figure #59: Destroyer Droid with energy shield.Rather a nice version of the Droideka it has all the detailing of the previous release from the 2005 Revenge Of The Sit line with a few refinements. The paint job is better and the detailing is sharper.The droid has head& shoulder& blaster armature and leg articulation.It comes equipped with 2 red blast effects that fit over the end of the blasters and look rather good. The large blue energy shield can be placed on the ground beside it to give the effect of energy deflecting off its shield. There is a peg and hole in the shield which allows you to put two shields together to create a sphere around a figure. This is a nice idea with one drawback - the Droideka doesn't fit inside! Most other figures will but this is a little bit of an oversight. Still& this is only a minor quibble.There is also a silver collector's coin that goes in the album with figure #1: Darth Vader.A great Droid and a must have for all those army builders out there."
1346,447,5," this toy hasnt been put down since christmas day& in fact all the thundercats toys santa brought have been played with non stop! hardwearing and designed for rough playing! Only thing is& I wish I had shopped around as found these items for half the price. but cant complain thats my problem& not the sellers!!!!"
1347,447,4," Bought as a present for my Grandson& 7& as he's just discovered Thundercats. Smart looking and the price was a lot less than shown in the local stores"
1348,447,5," a must for thundercat fans.  My son loved it& only thing to beware with littl eones is the cannon fires very quickly!!"
1349,447,5," Excellent toy and great value for money."
1350,448,5," Got it as a xmas gift for my 10 year old daughter& but she was a bit upset it arrived AFTER christmas. Good quality& small& had to emai seller a few times and my daughter loved it!"
1351,449,5," Hasbro kick off their first releases of 2008's Complete Saga collection with a wave of figures from Episode 3: Revenge Of The Sith. The next figure in the line is #07 Po Nudo& Separatist.This figure has not been released before and makes a welcome addition to the Revenge Of The Sith line.Due to the style of clothing& the articulation on this figure is rather limited but this is made up for wit the excellent detailing and paint work.Po Nudo has head (rotational and vertical)& shoulder (rotational and abductional)& elbow (rotational and vertical)& wrist (rotational) and torso (rotational) joints giving him 13 movements of articulation.There are no accessories but there is a personalised figure stand which is the same design that we had in the 2006 The Saga Collection line.An nice figure but probably one for completists only."
1352,449,5," This figure is one of the more unusual of the 30th Anniversary (TAC) later collection. I bought for the carded collection so I can't comment on the item quality as I never opened it."
1353,450,5," 4 year old daughter loves it& but lots of tiny pieces& so watch out! Great that it comes in a handy travel case. Playmobil should make more of these |cases|"
1354,450,5," Ideal 5 year old introduction to play Mobil"
1355,450,5," Love these playmobil sets& good for visiting to keep tot entertained. Small parts so would avoid if younger children around"
1356,450,5," We have several of these sets and they are wonderful quality.  I have also purchased several sets as gifts and always seem to go down well.  For the money there is hours of fun.  Would be a great toy to take on a plane or trip or holiday."
1357,450,5," Bought this on an offer for about Â£6 its brilliant& love that its in a case so cant lose all the bits. Wish I had bought more great presentssHave bought for Christmas for my 4 year old and she will love it.&"
1358,450,5," Bought as a birthday present for my four year old niece - hugely popular with her and her two year old sister& and they also use the pink carry case to move other toys around the house!"
1359,450,5," This has been great for my girl who also had the play mobile advent calendar& she now has more storage space for the little pieces. Also bought one as a Christmas present for a friend."
1360,450,5," Lovely toy& played with again and again. Very small parts so definitely three years plus or bits will just get lost but one of our favs and goes down well for birthdays too."
1361,451,5," this is great"
1362,452,5," Our grandson was over-joyed with the item"
1363,452,5," Great item"
1364,453,5," A lovely figure which will be a very well received gift from santa for my 5 year old. Love the tuft of hair at the back!"
1365,454,5," WOW!!! what a wonderful harley quinn from real action heroes. Glad i got one at the knocked down price of Â£70 i don't quite think she's worth Â£170 but grab one while you can. She can stand on her own but i've used the stand to get her posed like she's skippingShe comes with a set of open hands& set of fists and a hand to hold the gun with also a stand  . she is well sculpted and is quite well jointed her catsuit restricts movement  she comes in a nice box. she also came quickly and well packaged."
1366,454,5," Great figure and a good price did see on at a toyfair at Â£150 on amazon great price"
1367,455,5," very good& came on time"
1368,456,5," good i need more and more kind of products of ultraman excellent i love it . perfect toy i like it"
1369,457,5," My son love super hero's and by extension villains  and Scarcroft is one of his favourites. (Behind killer Croc&  killer moth& Mr freeze and carnage). So this figure is excellent and the price was perfect especially compared to some of the ranges& quick delivery too."
1370,458,5," Amazing quality really nice addition to my collection!"
1371,459,3," The Saga line continues with the Anakin Skywalker (Battle Of Coruscant) figure. Collector's will immediately recognise this as a reissue of the Revenge Of The Sith #2 Anakin from 2005 but this time the figure comes with a nice cloth cloak.He also comes with a blue lightsabre& lightsabre handle& alternate right hand and hologram figure. The detailing is quite good and the poesability is excellent although he tends to fall over forwards quite easily.One of the few good Anakin figures and a nice addition to any set."
1372,459,5," Im a huge Star Wars fan and even though im only 14& i have followed the saga till the very end.My favourite character is& without a doubt& Anakin Skywalker& So i was desperate to get a Anakin figure. My friend got me this as a present last year and its still in perfect condition!It comes with a cloth cloak& blue lightsaber& right hand and an un-opened lightsaber that can be attached to his belt. Although be warned& his accesories are very easily lost because they are so small! (I cant find his other lightsaber!)Overall this is a great toy and a great gift for any Star Wars fan. Now all i have to do is find a Padme Amidala figure!!Oh and i am a perfect example that girls CAN like Star Wars!!"
1373,460,5," Item as described - fast delivery"
1374,461,5," Christmas present for my grandson& I hope he gets as much enjoyment from this as his Dad did when they came out the first time"
1375,461,2," Very small not good value for price."
1376,461,3," Just what the little man wanted.Not as good as my original toy& but gives the little man hours of fun transforming his transformer back and forth."
1377,461,4," though brilliant& I think this product is slightly over priced for how small it is. I expected it to be much bigger than it actually was."
1378,461,5," Super toy for my five year old grandson...he loves it!! Very quick delivery too and a good competitive price.Much cheaper than Argos."
1379,461,5," Our grandson was over the moon at receiving this and spent hours over Christmas playing with it."
1380,461,5," My son was extremely happy to receive this at Christmas.  He likes the fact that it is so big."
1381,461,3," Good toy. However quality a little lacking and bit difficult to clip into Optimis Prime mode."
1382,462,5," A great quality item from Schleich. I can't rave enough over how please I am with this company's toys. Very pleased to see a male Elf along with the female elves. He is a charming little guy& with very nice colours. I will buy more of these in the future."
1383,462,5," This little elf brought the magic of Christmas to our home by appearing in different room each day. The children enjoyed hunting for him. The details on the elf were if high standard."
1384,462,5," great"
1385,463,5," This is an excellent idea& to make another version of an old favourite. My son loved this as he is a huge Star Wars fan and relates it to an old childhood favourite Mr Potato Head. Good quality and well made. It still drops to bits like the original Potato Head. Would definitely recommend this."
1386,464,4," conner kenway has some issues but they are not major his hands are a differant skin tone to his face and his right hidden blade won't fit in the recess for it but he is still a good buy for any one that is a fan of play arts kai figures or assassin creed he has a good range of weapons and has good range of movement and he is well painted"
1387,464,5," Husband was well pleased with this present"
1388,465,5," Perfect"
1389,466,5," This 'Alien figure is absolutely 100% articulated! And& it is much much better than the previous toy. It may seem like a bad figure& but as soon as you get it& have a blast!!!"
1390,466,5," Amazingly well detailed figure& one of the best ones and compliments my 4 predators& ill be adding a lot more from the alien series to my already huge but ever growing collection.  On the whole I would say that neca make the best collectors figures& ive only got 2 that I think are not so good which were my rocky 3"
1391,466,4," Great detail.Because this figure has a transparent head u can see the scull (eye sockets and nostrils) which you don't see in the movies.Which i find cool."
1392,466,5," Arrived in good time and in excellent condition. Great figure with lots of articulation and detail."
1393,466,4," As always& great service and a great product. Better still& its the anniversary edition!"
1394,466,5," Daughter loved this item....its fab....great quality and poseable....great item xxx"
1395,467,5," Brilliant toy& great for collectors. Young River is inside. Great quality. Great price. Cannot fault it. Would very much reccomend."
1396,467,5," Bought by my 7year old son with his Birthday money. He loves anything Doctor Who and is slightly obsessed by the whole phenomenon. He loved this figure and I was pleased with the speed if delivery and the excellent packaging which ensured the figure arrived in one piece. A must for Doctor Who figure collectors or fans"
1397,467,5," I always liked this figure and I had for 1/3 current market price. It is brand new except for a dent on a package corner. I don't care 'cos I put my figures loos on a shelf and& on the other hand& this detail was clearly stated by the seller.ILOVE IT!  .D  :D  :D"
1398,467,3," My son loves doctor who& so I bought this for him& he's autistic and loves opening n closing things especially the front part of the helmet which broke on the first day he got it. Did manage to prise it out and he still plays with it"
1399,467,5," It's perfect for Doctor Who fans& good resistance& really articulated& Young River Song is inside (there's another Impossible Astronaut version with the older River Song)."
1400,467,5," It is an amazing product and amazing priceI would recommend it to people with children that are in to doctor who also people that collect figures"
1401,467,4," my son is happy with the addition to his dr who figures was a little disappointed that river wasn't the face behind the mask& but still happy"
1402,468,5," For fans of the original Transformer universe& Grimlock will need no introduction. However I'll give you a brief one anyway. The head of the Dinobots& Grimlock is one of the most loved characters from both the 80s cartoon and the comic strip - mostly known for his inability to do anything correctly except fight. This model is a faithful reproduction of his G1 form and follows on from the previous masterpiece versions. The model itself is just over 10 inches or so in height& a little smaller than Masterpiece Prime and Megatron& and a little taller than Masterpiece Starscream (I feel the idea with any forthcoming models is that they will all roughly be around the same size as Starscream and Grimlock& leaving Prime and Megatron (as well as - in my opinion - the pointless Ultra Magnus repaint) to stand over the rest. There is some die-cast in him& significantly less than Masterpiece Prime however and this is a disappointment given the price increase compared to other models in the line. However& if you're a fan of Grimlock& you won't be disappointed with how accurate he is - stunning in both robot and dino mode& he looks just like he was drawn in the series& right down to how his legs tuck up and form his tail. He is easier to transform than the other MP models which is a great bonus as he is undoubtedly the one you will want to have in both modes (I mean& who's going to display Megatron is gun mode?) Grimlock comes with a host of accesories& some rather superflous but all fun (my favourite is his little apron& bow-tie and drinks tray as featured in the episode Madman's Paradise). Also included are his sword& a gun& his brain-melding kit (from when he created the technobots).Read more â€º"
1403,468,5," The other reviewer has pretty much covered it& this is an excelelnt if pricey Trasnsformers toy. After Prime he's the best MP figure in my opinion."
1404,469,5," I got this as a gift for a friend that is a good fan of Jojo's Bizarre& and he was delighted!Excellent quality and good price. Worth shopping."
1405,470,5," fast delivery&grandson well pleased with purchase."
1406,471,5," Great quality& amazing toy. Looks even better in person"
1407,472,5," Rook is the new 'bot on the block& who is remarkably well designed for an original and new character. The vehicle is a kind of SWAT vehicle which look's awesome& but the best(for me) is in robot mode& where he has no visible hand's but has port's instead& I like plugging a combiner fist into each port."
1408,472,4," Originally bought for an Xmas gift. The recipient was delighted with this gift."
1409,472,5," Items arrived in very good time I think my grandson will love them.."
1410,472,4," Great"
1411,472,5," Good"
1412,473,4," prompt delivery&good service....and a very reasonable price..i`ll be buying more from this range of figures."
1413,474,5," Wreck-gar& alt mode& is a motorbike& a dirt one of some sort I think! Robot mode& Wreak-gar is a homage to his G1 counterpart& thou under the Reveal the Shield line& in all respects& he's apart of the Classics/Universe 2.0/Generations line. He comes with a four blade axe which in vehicle mode is part of his back end forming the cover for the rear wheel and the exhaust pipe via a clip system. At the front of the bike mode is a rubsign which is revealing what faction he belongs to. In robot mode& he may look like a bunch of miss and match parts but that only adds to his charater being from a planet full of junk. He has extensive range of movement in his body and carries a shield that is his other wheel in bike mode. The best things about Wreak-gar& if a kid seen the ordinal 80s movie or TV series is that they can get him talking TV (in their world) and he can have another Deluxe figure or smaller with the peg holes ride him in bike mode. If your looking to display him in vehicle mode& he has a kick stand to help him stay up. Transformation isn't for rookies as he can be a bit fiddly yet he a great figure to add to anyone's collection& so I recomend him highly!"
1414,475,4," A bit smaller than I thought but I should of checked the details! But overall happy with the Product fast and quick delivery! My son will love this for his birthday! Thank you"
1415,475,5," Perfect"
1416,476,4," The medicos figure of Kakyoin is very well made. He comes with a few different hands& so you can re-create several of his infamous poses& and an interchangeable head with him wearing his iconic sunglasses (which he is seen wearing after he recovers from a certain fight during the Egypt Arc)The figure is very easy to pose& and does not seem like it would break easily. The detail is top notch quality& as is with all the medicos figures.Now the one problem I have with this figure is its size. I collect the Statue Legend and Medicos Figures already& so I know round about (no pun intended there) what size they are. Kakyoin is around 15CM tall& so a little smaller compared to some of the others. The thing is though& the figure looks small and almost dainty compared to a lot of the other medicos& such as Jolyne& Dio& etc.However& don't let that out you off. The figure is lovely& and definitely worth adding to your collection!"
1417,476,5," The detail and the quality on this product is amazing! It came a few days eailer than expected as well and quite cheep considering some of the prices people charge for these figures."
1418,476,5," Im very happy with my figure. It came on christmas eve and in plenty of time. Everything was how it was adversited& its all good"
1419,477,5," Good quality item& fast delivery. I use Spock to remind me to pay the bills or phone my mother. Expensive (Kirk is cheaper)& but makes me smile."
1420,477,5," Great item& looks just like the photo"
1421,478,5," excellent figure very detailed took over 4 weeks to arrive but worth its weight in gold seller is excellent and genuine would recommend seller very good quality figure!very well made you can move his joints hands etc very easily comes with extra hands and accessories a lot better than some of the other 7 inch figures on the market this really is a must buy figure you wont be disappointed!!!"
1422,478,5," Arrived a lot quicker than I thought it would. Good quality the detail is fab."
1423,478,5," Beautiful figure& loads of possibility!"
1424,479,5," Happy I got it and was well packaged"
1425,480,5," This is a pretty good value set I thinkIt has 8 in the box and they are well presented. The tin is sturdy enough& nicely decorated and the (unhinged) lid goes on easily& even for a 7 year old.I dont know all the names& but we (apparently- dont hold me to this as I have no idea on these) got Liberty& Cleo& Blingo& Roxy and 4 others. It looks to me like the exact set shown in the picture but I dont know if every box has the same set in it. There are 2 each in pink& green& yellow and blue& and all the local kids crowded round to ooh and ahh at them so I guess they must be a good combination :-)Hope this helps someone equally clueless"
1426,480,5," My 9 year old grand daughter loves collecting the Moshi monster  figures and these did not disappoint she loved them."
1427,480,5," My daughters latest addition to her Moshi Monsters collection was an instant hit& probably her favourite Moshi Monsters tin so far and for us ordering from Amazon makes life very easy :)"
1428,480,4," This is good value for money considering how much some websites are trying to charge for Moshi Monster products. My five year old son loves these and the gold ones I bought him for Christmas. Fast delivery too thanks!!"
1429,480,5," I'm 12 and obessed with Moshi !! Get this. Great play value& figures are great quality& not scratching or anything. :))::))::)) get it ! U won't regret it :)):::))):))):))):::::)))))"
1430,480,5," I think this tin is great!!!!! I'm a bit puzzled why it says ' Moshi rox tin game' as it isn't a game. But any way this tin is really good for storing moshi figures& it comes with 8 rox figures that are similar to the normal ones but are different colours and are more square. The tin can hold up to 45 moshis!!! I would recommend buy more than one tin as it may come with the same. the tins have the same moshis but can come in different colours for example .... Blingo may come in yellow in one tin and it may come in pink in another but they may be the same.Altogether I rate this 5 star!!"
1431,480,4," My daughter collects these Moshi Monsters and adores them all. This is one of the latest series in the collectors range and my daughter is not disappointed.As a parent it is hard to understand why children like what they do& but sometimes we should take an interest in their interests and support them. I buy these for my daughter but I also encourage her to save some of her pocket money and buy some herself. She has a goal to aim for this way and is happy to do little jobs around the house to earn extra pocket money"
1432,480,5," Very good price and it arrived fast. I got this for my younger sisters birthday and she loves it. Great way to store the moshlings together"
1433,481,5," all I can say is my nephew loves it.... Super fast delivery too"
1434,481,5," as advertised& good fast delivery too. my kid loves 'em"
1435,482,5," This was a present for my little boy.  He loved that characters and I was very pleased at the price."
1436,483,5," good toy& that is a toy i want to collected& perfect& if you have some new one& i will buy it at first time."
1437,484,5," Hey& I collect these and my son loves it! he's got used to the idea that they stay boxed& but I get him some from time to time and he loves them too."
1438,485,5," I wish there was one button to press so I don't have to send all this messages ever time as I have to right something ever time one comes as it hearts my finger righting thanks."
1439,486,4," Ignore the black dalek and TARDIS picture shown on this page.  The product being sold is actually a gold dalek and cyberman.Having grown up with die cast toys in the 70s& I was a bit shocked by what passes for die cast today.  These are thin and light and feel like they'd probably break apart if you dropped them.  They aren't the chuncky& heavy& near indestructable toys I think of as die cast.  Also& while the cyberman is all metal except for his removable disk shaped stand& the Dalek is almost half plastic& with not just the arms and eyestalk being plastic but also the dome and (I think) the neck.On the positive side& the detail and paintwork are excellent and the build quality on both the dalek and the cyberman is very good and far surpases other Character Options toys I've seen.  The Dalek has four little wheels on the bottom to roll around your desk and the eyestalk& dome and both arms all move smoothly without any of the sticking problems found on the larger Character Options daleks.  The mini die cast daleks are in fact the best articulated daleks in my extensive collection (whereas the 5 inch die cast dalek in the same series is the worst articulated of all).The cyberman has no articulation. He can be lifted off his disk shaped plastic stand and will stand up on a flat surface without it& being very well balanced.Overall I'm very happy with these as a collector& but I wouldn't let kids near them unless they happen to be the sort of OCD-super-careful-of-their-toys kid that I was."
1440,486,4," They are a bit small& but very well finished& with all the details. The Dalek moves it's head and an arm. Besides& it's provided with tiny wheels to allow you running it on a plain surface."
1441,486,5," Great Models Of A Dalek"
1442,487,5," This is an unusual set of figures& nicely painted and well designed so that despite the lack of bases& there are no problems in standing any of them on a smooth surface.Pegasus wings are separate from the body. They have stubs which need to be pressed into similar size holes in the body but these are tight fitting and small hands may require assistance.The comparative sizes of the figures are well indicated in the website photo& measured heights are approximately 40mm foot-sole to eye for the two warriors armed with sword and shield and approximately 50mm for the Cyclops.Surprisingly for a set that features a Minotaur (45mm)& a Cyclops and Pegasus& there is no Theseus& Ulysses& Perseus or Jason :(. Although there is a Hercules (40mm) wearing what could be a lion skin and wielding a sword over his head.The two warriors are described on the tube as Achilles and a Spartan (!). However we needn't pay too close attention to what it says on the tube and either of these figures can represent any Greek hero our imagination desires :).Initially I was a little disappointed that the Cyclops& Minotaur& Cerberus and Hercules& are not larger but they are still nice figures. Cerberus looks better in the flesh than on the website"
1443,487,5," You can easily explain a number of Greek myths by using those figurines and some fantasy!I think this is highly educational and now my 5 yo girl knows everything about Hercules and Zeus.I warmly recommend in conjunction with any book on Greek mythology.On the down side& there aren't any figurines about the Greek Gods."
1444,487,5," I was looking for some small action figures to put in my son's advent calendar as this year I have bought a fabric calendar where you put in your own treats.  He will get one of these figures each day - they are so detailed and lifelike - a bit gory& with blood and guts hanging out... but that's all to the good as far as my 8 year old is concerned!  Lovely stuff!"
1445,487,5," I use these and similar for working with children in my sand tray for therapeutic play.  A good mix of sparking the imagination whilst being small and portable enough for my therapy kit. Swords can be a bit flimsy though and have had to replace after a year or so of use& but suppose that's pretty good going really!"
1446,487,5," For children& these figures help the stories of the Greek myths come to life. After reading about various escapades& my children love to do reenactments  with these fun little characters."
1447,488,5," Grandaughter Loved it& that says it all. She has now got several monsters in her collection. I have also purchased a few extra one's as they are a reasonable price. My grandaughter is getting a nice collection of these although she is not allowed to take them to school as they have gone missing& so they must be quite popular.=================== ++++++++++++ +++++++++ =========="
1448,489,5," Brilliant action figure of one of the heroes of the Green Lantern Corp& the only thing is& because of the shape of the characters feet& the model needs to be permanently on its stand which is not a problem really"
1449,490,5," Quite possibly the best legends figure everArticulation in abundance"
1450,491,5," Hasbro continue their 30th Anniversary Collection with figure #20: StormtrooperBased on the body of the excellent Vintage Original Trilogy Collection Stormtrooper from 2004& this one has all the ultra poseability of that model with one refinement - a removable helmet. The face underneath is similar to the face on the Saga 2006 Death Star Gunner but has a couple of scars highlighted on the cheek.The Stormtrooper comes equipped with his helmet and the trademark black Blastech E-11 blaster rifle.There is also a collector's coin which can go in the album with figure #1: Darth Vader.One of the best Stormtroopers to date and a must have for all those army builders out there& especially if you missed the vintage '04 release."
1451,492,4," My uncles birthday was looming he is mad about cowboys"
1452,493,5," Hasbro continue to celebrate their 30th Anniversary with their first batch of figures from the Clone Wars animated series. The first of the three is Ithorian Jedi Knight Roron Corobb.The figure is a faithful and realistic representation of the Jedi that died at the hands of Grievous as the general made his push to capture Chancellor Palpatine.He is quite poseable with head& shoulder& elbow& wrist& hip and knee joints and he comes equipped with his trusty blue lightsabre. The sabre is the same design as the one that comes with figure #9: McQuarrie Concept Stormtrooper.Roron comes complete with a silver collector's coin which goes in the album you get with #1: Darth Vader.A great figure and a must have for the Clone Wars collection."
1453,494,5," this is a present& I'm sure they will love it"
1454,494,5," Exactly what a 5-year old wanted"
1455,494,5," Brilliant"
1456,495,5," Bought as a Christmas gift for 9 year old son. He LOVES it! He already has a few single Star Wars hero masher figures& and can now combine figures from the different Staw Wars trilogies and is delighted."
1457,495,4," I bought these as a Christmas present for my 5 year old who loves them.  The only point to mention is that to start with he found it a bit tricky to pull off and fix together the different pieces."
1458,495,5," Grandson was delighted with them"
1459,495,5," Great set for my 8 year old son."
1460,496,5," I'm usually wary of licensed products but this is Fisher Price (on Cbeebies but not a BBC branded product) and is well made. Interestingly I'll start with the packaging as for once& the ties used to secure to the open display box are not wire and are very easy to remove once pulled under the cardboard tags inside& a plus for an excited child!On land& the Gup-O trundles along quite nicely& nothing too clever but in the bath& with a flick of the fin& suckers come out from beneath and the Gup-O can be stuck on smooth tiles& bath sides or even the bottom.The separate baby orca toy sinks to the bottom rather than floats and the character and her helmet are easy for a small (3+) hand to work with. Dashi sits in the cockpit and can be secured via a small hole in he back but this is a little too fiddly.In the bath& the Gup-O neither sinks or floats however& more of a sideways list - it's not advertised as anything other than sticking so more of an observation! No propulsion in the water either& just a child's imagination.Good fun& nice and chunky and well constructed& not a floating bath toy but fun in and out of the bath."
1461,496,5," This is a wonderful addition to our Octonauts family - we have the Gup D& the Octobuggy& Barnacles On-the-Go Pod and the Deep Sea Octo-lab and this latest addition is already a firm favourite with my Octonauts fans!Like the Gup D& the Gup O (presumably O for Orca) can be used as a toy anywhere in the house - including in the bathtub and this makes it double the fun. The fact that can be |parked on the side of the bathtub or the tiles on the side of the bath is a real hit with my children and it is as simple as 8 mini suckers on the bottom of the Gup& which can be clicked down using the dorsal fin or clicked again when you want to retract them and go back to moving it around and flapping its tail.Dashi is lovely in her purple Octosuit and well made like all of the series of Octonaut figures in the series made by Fisher Price and the addition of the removable helmet and you also get a little all-black orca to add to the fun."
1462,496,3," This is a great toy from the Octonauts series on Cbeebies. It looks just like the cartoon character should and feels quite solid for a little plastic toy. The sucker cup stick-to-the-wall action works pretty well both on the fridge and in the bath. The Dashi character has a little hole in the back too so it sits and stays in the vehicle pretty well. The helmet for Dashi is a loose fit at best and a little annoying. The small fish creature included is a little pointless and will be lost very soon I suspect. No lights or sound effects so no batteries required. Nice toy but we're not sure it's worth much over a tenner."
1463,496,3," My three year old daughter loves Octonauts and has most of the Fisher Price toys - not least because I also enjoy Octonauts and am quite fond of playing with the toys!My main criticism of this Gup is that the figures do not properly fit into the cockpit - this is a bit of a problem with most Gups& but is particularly evident with this one. Basically& Captain Barnacles doesn't fit at all while Dashi and others fall out as soon as you start playing.Also& as my daughter tends to act-out stories from the books and programme& she doesn't play with this one as much as the other Gups since it barely features (I haven't found an single episode with it in!)."
1464,496,4," This is another great set in the Octonauts range. It doesn't have the immediate wow factor of the Octo Max Suit which is the current favourite in my house but is a sturdy well built set with no easy to break of pieces so it can withstand rough play.This is more of a water play toy with tiny suction pads to attach it to the bath or tiles. You press the back fin to lower the suction pads. the tail wobbles around a bit if the Orca Gup is wheeled around (there is one wheel under the tail). Dashi can sit down in the vehicle or stand with the waist swivel legs.Not the brightest cheerful looking set in the range but it has good play value and it's well made.Octonauts are a great hit with the foundation aged 4-5 year old boys I look after.Recommended."
1465,496,2," This is a simple toy for toddlers but isn't a complete success. It is not really waterproof& so though it can be used at bath time& it can't really be used in the bath. Construction is a bit plasticky and there are some small pieces so be careful there with a young child. There is a mechanism underneath that allows you to alternate between suckers (to stick on a wall) and wheels (to run across a hard floor) but the mechanism is flakey and often sticks half way (and feels that it will break if you force it)& meaning that is does neither one things or the other well. It needs some re-designing& I think"
1466,496,4," When this arrived the first thing we noticed about this toy is that it is a bit larger than we expected. We had been expecting something probably about 3/4 of the size this actually is. Admittedly this is going to be a personal thing but it set us off on a positive note.When we opened this our two year old got very excited and luckily the toy is nice and easy to release from the packaging so we didn't have an impatient small person waiting long. Our son loves Octonauts and anything to do with the sea so knew the character and that it was designed as a killer whale. When we got it out of the packet he was able to put the pieces together easily and with mummy and daddy playing we had lots of fun games whizzing it round the living room. The moving tail is a nice feature which helped to hold his interest. It was fairly late on in the day and as bath time loomed one of the major positives of this toy became apparent& we were able to continue the same games in the bath! Amphibious toys are a huge favourite in this house as our toddler hates stopping play to go in the bath so this sort of toy are great. The ability to stick the Gup-O on the bath wall& though simple& is great as it meant that Dashi was taken out on many adventures& coming back to base regularly to make sure everything was ok.One gripe I do have is the price of the Gup-O - although a well designed and sturdy toy it seems a few pounds more expensive than it really should be. Perhaps the result of being a branded toy from a popular TV show it seems a shame to push the price up so that it feels you are not getting value for money. If this had been slightly more competitively priced I would have gone for a 5 star review& but feel I really can't justify one."
1467,497,4," Great product& was a gift for my other half as hes a massive fan of the walking dead and has started to collect these.Would have given it 5stars but the packiging around the box was tattered which was embarrising to give it as a gift and its also a collectable so you would expect the box to be recieved in a good condition"
1468,497,5," Bought as a Christmas present for my son& a big Michonne fan.  Well packaged and fast delivery.  A very good likeness of the lady and good bobble action.  A definite must for any TWD fan."
1469,497,5," Fast and reliable service. Received my item before estimated delivery date which is perfect for the christmas rush. Very happy and certainly be using again."
1470,497,5," Fantastic item - just a great present for fans of Walking Dead!  Quick postage and well packaged.  Thank you!"
1471,497,5," Great products"
1472,498,5," Great figure  my seven year old son  loves it well build very strong."
1473,498,3," a bit smaller than expected"
1474,498,5," Updated"
1475,499,5," With the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey released in cinemas& not to forget to mention published now on DVD and Blu Ray (including an extended cut)& much has been desired from the 3/3 4| and 6| figure line from fans and collectors.So has the (almost) year long wait been worth it?Comparing what we were shown early 2013 at Toy Fair for the Desolation Of Smaug figure line"
1476,499,5," As a big fan of the Hobbit films I had to start a collection of the figures. Azog is the main bad guy that the company have faced in the first two films and is a much sought after figure. The figure is made with great detail and had many moving parts. He comes with his battle mace which fits into his right hand and looks the business. For the collectors out there& the item arrived very well packaged and the card was in perfect condition."
1477,499,5," an amazing action figure. fun to play with. It come with a sword and it is good quality. Very Good"
1478,499,5," As before bought this figure for Cian get condition was delighted it arrived in time for Christmas was a bit disappointed that it could not b delivered directly to me would have being willing to pay extra for postage if I could have had it delivered to Ireland"
1479,499,5," Fantastic figure& its about time this character was made into an action figure. The Bridge Direct has finally given this orc leader from the Hobbit trilogy."
1480,500,5," Delivered on time and is perfect! Just the scary present I wanted for my mums birthday and she loved it! Was thrilled as is just like the doll in the film."
1481,500,5," great product and service"

1483,500,5," Lovely item and a fast delivery!! = )"
1484,501,5," Bought as a replacement for one knocked off the shelf whose head had snapped off! Rookie error& this is a Gollum and the now glued figure is Smeagol& my daughter is happy though now she has the pair."
1485,501,5," Bought for my 11 year old who loves it and is used more of an ornament than a toy.Quality is 100% and very sturdy."
1486,501,5," Quick delivery . Would use again"
1487,502,5," I absolutely love it!"
1488,503,5," I used these to go on the top of my daughters birthday cake. They were just what I needed. Perfect. Now they are played with on a daily basis."
1489,503,3," Ariel started losing her green rubber dress in bits where as the others are fine but my daughter loves them."
1490,503,5," I bought these figures. along with some Frozen characters for my little grand-daughter's fifth birthday and she was delighted with them. They arrived quickly and well packaged and I think they were a success - the only fault was (not with this set but the Frozen ones) was that Kristoff can't stand without the temporary plastic packaging (guessing Anna was wearing him down!)."
1491,503,5," My little girl who is very into Disney princesses absolutely loves these! They are a nice size and seem to be sturdy and well made& only complaint is that Snow White didn't come in the packet and I had to order that separately."
1492,503,5," Really good value for money.  Bought to go on top of my granddaughter's birthday cake.Looked really good and now she is able to play with them .Excellent purchase. Thank you."
1493,503,5," Our toddler loves these figures and plays with them constantly.  They are pretty good quality but as another reviewer pointed out& Ariel's paintwork started to peel fairly quickly."
1494,503,5," Used as caketoppers for 18th birthday cake. Recipient was pleased. Good quality figures"
1495,503,5," Good hard wearing figures & which is needed for children. My granddaughter loved them"
1496,504,5," Excellent figure& great detail"
1497,505,5," Amazing& knew it was a Special Edition Release but never expected to find one for sale& Brilliant!!"

1499,506,5," Cute little smurf"
1500,506,5," Excellent"
1501,507,5," Perfect. Looks exactly like the picture& xame in good time for an import. Very happy with my purchase."
1502,508,5," Excellent very quickly dispatched - will use again"
1503,509,5," Made a freddy Krueger fan very happy& fantastic item& well made.The item looked the same as item on the internet"
1504,509,5," Very very very very happy to buy this and it was under a 10 pound note now it's not cool I made proffer Montenegro"
1505,509,3," I bought this to start a little collection& I had already owned a Walter White bobble head but from another store& I thought that all bobble heads would sort of be the same size and shape but this one was bigger than my other one. The bobble head itself is exactly how you see it on here."
1506,509,1," Not happy. Doesn't look like him. Its plastic. Got this as I'm an avid collector. Normally made out of ceramic. You can get originals for the same price. I feel robbed. Head also fell off first day it came."
1507,509,5," Love it& will be kept boxed even got a very small clear plastic bag over it to keep the box dust free sits on top of my bookshelves"
1508,510,5," Fantastic"
1509,510,5," ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„"
1510,511,5," this is a great toy that i have played with and kept for ages and would like to see more toys like this."
1511,511,5," Along with a great many other Star Wars toys this felt right at home with the others."
1512,512,4," Nicely detailed and great textures. Too bad both the hinges/swivels in the elbows are a bit loose on mine."
1513,513,4," The glass part looks a bit cheap and fragile but it still is a beautiful jewellery for any Harry Potter fan. And who knows ? Wearing it could even bring you luck !"
1514,513,5," This a must have for any Harry Potter fan& the quality is really high and looks exactly as advertised. Arrived quickly and very well packaged."
1515,513,5," The item is a perfect replica of that in the film housed within a hardwood base and a glass dome making a very nice display item (Not a toy)."
1516,513,2," Love the noble collection stock but this was quite disappointing the potion bottle keeps falling off the holder and it would have been better if it was a glass bottle...  Disappointing..."
1517,514,3," We bought this for our 4 year old son for Christmas although I actually got it when it was on offer at Â£31.99 in September. I agree with another reviewer in that this is a fair price for it. I don't think it's worth paying more than about Â£50 for it and can't believe it's actually on sale at Â£128.00 as I'm writing this.We have quite a few bits from Imaginext and although this is a great toy we've encountered a problem with the lift winding mechanism almost as soon as my son started playing with it which has meant the lift doesn't work properly. I would have brushed this off as a one off however we have the fire station set as well and the fire engine hose obviously works on the same system and that stopped working quite quickly too. I think we can fix the lift issue with a bit of DIY repair work but it's still annoying to have to do it. But it is still a fun toy*****Update*****After contacting Mattel about the lift problem and getting an unsatisfactory reply and no idea how to fix it I researched it online and found lots of people have had the same problem.. For anyone else who has this problem it can be fixed relatively easily once you know how! Unscrew the screws that hold the red bit into the reel and the ones that attach it to the main structure but not the screws that keep the black reel together. Wind the string around the black reel twice so it's very taut and then get it back in place and screwed in without the string coming out again. And hey presto& a working lift!! I did think I was going to go crazy though trying to do it so I'm keeping my stars at 3."
1518,514,5," bought this for my son for xmas its a good size very well made sturdy my son will love this wil have to buy few more extra  imaginext figures for it"
1519,514,2," After seeing the advert on telly& my son wanted the Imaginext Batcave so he could put the bad guys in jail.  Came Xmas morning& he was overjoyed to unwrap his batcave.  However& he was bitterly disappointed to see that the jail door was missing.  After checking everywhere in the box& I could not locate said door.  I contacted customer service and they responded promptly& promising to send the door in the post.  Received package in the post this morning containing a part that does not fit& as a matter of fact& it doesn't even seem to be part of this playset.  Now had to contact them again.  GRRRR.  The lift is already a bit tempermental& as well.For the price they charge for this large piece of plastic& is it too much to expect that it& at least& come with all the parts included? Very sad son and very annoyed mum.  This was my first Imaginext purchase and it will most likely be my last."
1520,514,5," We already have several toys from the Imaginext range.  They are all built like tanks and my son adores playing with them for hours on end.  Once the Batcave is released from its packaging there are a couple of bits to clip on& but it's basically fully assembled.  My son is 5 years old& and when he's on his knees playing with his Batcave& it's as tall as he is - a substantial toy.  There is a gun that fires a missile& a crane arm& a prison cell& a telescope& a light up batman sign& a lift that goes up and down& a turntable for Robin's bike... and probably a lot more that I've forgotten to mention.  In the words of my very excited son& |there's just so much to do& Daddy!|.  The set includes the Batcave& Batman and Robin characters& a missile for the launcher& a bike (which fits Robin only) a couple of tools& a bat computer and a pair of clip on wings for Batman.  I can't begin to tell you how pleased my son is with this toy.  His face lit up like you wouldn't believe when he started to unwrap it."
1521,514,5," Couldn't find one in the main shops as christmas gift for 5 yr old son. Searched online and where surprised to find this item at a great value and in-stock! Purchased it straight away although doubting if we would get it by christmas eve! This company delivered the next day after placing the order! It was the best toy this christmas and 'Santa' delivered again!!!!"
1522,514,5," In our house& where toys get broken fairly easily (3 boys) it is hard to find toys that last more that 10 minutes before getting broken. I have found that imaginext toys seem to be fairly robust. This batcave is great fun for my boys and they play with it all the time& even nearly a year after buying it. It is worth noting that that they also have the old version of this batcave that was much stronger and had less things to fall off/get lost...that is the only downside really& there are more bits on this to fall off& but they are easy to put back on again. The main thing is that they still love this toy....even after owning it for so long.....(Just noticed that there is an even newer version of the batcave now available in a popular high street home shopping catalogue....letters to santa are being written as I speak)"
1523,514,5," I got this for my sons birthday when he turned 6. He was SO excited and so was my 8 year old son and 3 year old daughter!!!!All 3 of them play with it constantly (I got it in April and it is now October) They don't seem to tire from it at all. It is definitely robust!Also all 3 of their friends have loved it too and got really excited when they saw it!The price seems to have gone down a bit since I bought it and I think it is worth it. Knowing how robust and the amount of time they play with it I would pay more!!It's really worth buying the pack of figures to go with it if you have more than one child though.It's also great that you can add other things to it. It's so nice to see my 3 playing nicely together with the same toy :-)"
1524,515,5," Superb model with wonderful detailing& comes with so much extras too which isn't mentioned in advert& even the box is cool ha ha"
1525,515,5," One for the collectors. Absolutely fantastic. Thank you."
1526,515,5," My son was over the moon with this."
1527,515,1," excellent"
1528,516,5," In my opinion& this is superior to NECA's Koba in the first wave of 'Dawn' figures.It represents the character better this time round. His snarling head-scan is beautifully ugly and captures Koba's personality perfectly. The paint-work is excellent& from his eyes to his teeth.From the neck down& the sculpt is the exact same as last time& except this time the paint job ins slightly different but superior in my opinion.His accessories consist of a machine gun and interchangeable hands to hold the gun.Articulation is identical also.If you are not a completest& I would recommend getting the series 1 Caesar& but the series 2 Koba for the best plastic incarnations of these characters.A Monkey holding a machine gun just makes a cool figure in my opinion!Comes in clam-shell packaging."
1529,516,3," The details are excellent but it's not a toy to play with& the hands keep falling off. My 11 yr old son  was disappointed and now keeps it as a display on his bookcase."
1530,517,5," Hasbro continue their Saga collection with this Clone Trooper sergeant.Previously available in the Entertainment Earth Clone Trooper army builder packs from 2005& here's a chance to get another cool clone if you missed the exclusives.Collector's will recognise this as a repaint of the Clone Wars 2003 #50 Clone Trooper.The figure is very poseable with multiple points of articulation and comes equipped with a blaster rifle& a randomly packed mini hologram figure and a personalised stand.A note for collectors: some of these were packed with figure stands that are have an error on them. A whole wave were released with the name printed on a The Empire Strikes Back stand. Check before opening as you may have a rare variant on your hands.A must have for all those army builders out there."
1531,518,4," Came quickly& awesome little figure. My only hate is& as with all pop vinyls& there is minor paint splashing and crossover on different parts of the bobble-head& luckily with this one because of the colours it looks like battle damage. Regardless pop vinyls are high quality figures and I will continue expanding my collection until I run out of window sill."
1532,518,5," Great item for a great price& I'm sure my friend will love this. The box the figure comes in is slightly damaged but not too much of a pain. Thanks& and would highly recommend."
1533,518,2," The bobblehead itself was fine. But the box it was in (the Funko Pop box not the Amazon box) was not sealed and one of the sides was falling off."
1534,518,5," Look& I'm a huge Star Wars and Funko fan. Nothing wrong with this at all. Buy it now!"
1535,518,1," Product arrived with dog eared and battered box. Looked second hand. Sent it back."
1536,518,4," Bought for a friend who loves star wars so he was super happy with this!"
1537,519,5," Great gift always on the look out for new cast to the force"
1538,519,4," Lovely  new figure"
1539,520,4," My pet shop loving daughter adores this addition to her collection.My negative comment& as always is that there is a ridiculous amount of packaging with these toys!"
1540,520,5," I think the bat will look pritty cute with the eye mask on. the bat is my favourite i think. the monkey is so cute with the hat on idk if the catterpiller looks good with the blue or pink I will proboly buy this littelist pet shop pack OMG I love this so muck. YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY!!!"
1541,521,5," When looking through the Amazon Search (especially under Transformers Reissues)& I came along this guy of the Takara |Transformers Collection|& and thought to myself |Why not?|.So thus I ordered it& and when it arrived there was nothing more of a magical feeling of having a vintage transformer mold in your hands (and even better with the missile launchers un-nullified).Of course there are stickers& and in spite of being slightly hard to pull off a surface if a mistake has occurred& it really gave the toy a full vintage feel& and thus standing proud on my shelf.BUTBear in mind& this is a G1 mold that has been released in 1985& and even though this version of the toy is 10 years old as of this writing& it is a very vulnerable piece (especially the long black joint and the ladder)so thus he must be handled with care or is generally reserved for adult collectors only.Otherwise& if you are a G1 fan& or want to get started on your own personal |G1 mold/reissue collection|& he is not a bad place to start& so highly recommended."
1542,522,5," My grandson loved the real effect fire with this one. A good buy to go with other cowboy and indian figures"
1543,522,5," Playmobil is brilliant my kids love it and at this price it was a great buy. the led fire is a good touch and have had them playing for hours"
1544,522,5," good item"
1545,523,5," Fab Minnie cutout. Used on my daughters birthday table which gave it a real wow factor! Definately better than balloons as these cut outs can be used in many ways."
1546,523,5," Fantastic addition to a childrens party.  Photos looked great with this.  The kids loved it as it was at their height."
1547,523,5," Great size"
1548,524,5," Good quality but very expensive and poor value for money"
1549,525,5," Bought this for my daughter who is very happy with it.  They are hard to find here in the UK& and this guy looks great."
1550,526,5," Good model with good detail.Not as much fun as a doomwheel though :)"
1551,527,3," Once again Character Options have missed a trick but let's start with the positives. The 'pilot' dalek is wonderfully detailed with the unique colouring of the black/grey head"
1552,527,2," Disappointing. I have marked this down as the panels don't move to enclose the Dalek pilot. Also& a few lights/sound effects wouldn't have gone amiss.The cannon fires well and the panels do pop off& but that's it. This is more of an adult collectors toy than a childrens's toy which is a shame as my son was swayed by the TV adverts.We also purchased the 12th doctor Sonic Screwdriver and that is being played with constantly whilst this Dalek is left sitting on the shelf."
1553,527,4," Bought for my Dalek mad son.  +s it comes with its own Dalek& in a paint job not available anywhere else& the missile launcher works great (maybe too great).  -s The panels easily fall off& they don't open and close like they did in the show& the missile is too easy to loose.  Dalek doesn't stay in the cockpit (no way to secure it)."
1554,527,4," My little one is a massive doctor who fan and he loves this toy"
1555,527,5," One of the best Doctor Who items of recent times& but it cost me a whacking Â£29.99 when the retail price is Â£19.99"
1556,527,5," love it /goes with collection thankyou"
1557,527,4," Excellent item& arrived quickly"
1558,527,5," This was great surprise gift ."
1559,528,5," As expected.great little collectors Piece& Fine detail and the style of Commander Palmers Armour is super cool. Shame it was not available in the larger Kai Arts version&&&&&&&&But thy are rare in the uk......and not worth Â£150Excellent delivery."
1560,528,5," Its good ..."
1561,529,5," I already owned a few Alternators& and didn't think you would ever find a better Transformer. I bought Arcee on my wife's request&as she found it mean that Shockwave and Dead End were ganging up on Silverstreak. I am so glad that I did! In car mode& Arcee looks like a fantastic model of an Honda S2000&and converts to a pink and white Autobot female. Mostly in heavyweight diecast metal&which looks and feels so much better than her Alternator equivalents. The attention to detail is fantastic-she has a removable hardtop&which can be replaced with a piece of plastic which makes her actually look like a convertible! A brilliant touch&along with the usual Binaltech/Alternator features&such as opening bonnet&doors and boot.Even the steering works properly...I'm not normally one for buying Autobots&but this one stands proud in my collection&and I'd recommend her to anyone."
1562,530,5," Great for 5 year old"
1563,531,4," Great ship and cards to add to my rebel hanger while I wait for the MF to be reprinted but I must admit to becoming a little bit disappointed with FFGs quality control. The cockpit is stuck on a bit wonky and the painting on the cockpit windows is not very good with bits of the 'glass' not being painted...Still& X-Wing is a brilliant and continually expanding game with some of the best pre-painted miniatures i've seen (it's just a pain that I will have to touch up the paint on some of them at some point when i've got time - at least I don't have to paint them from scratch!)."
1564,531,5," I Ordered this small cargo transport& because I wanted to run illegal cargos to the outer rim systems& right under the nose of the empire. When it arrived however& it turned out to be on the small side& as in it is around 15cm across! (approx.) How Am I supposed to fit me& two droids& and a comedy Wookie sidekick& into something so small? I don't care how fast it is& I can't see the point of a starship that I could easily fit in my coat pocket& my lightsaber is bigger then this thing! Anyway& it is the perfect size to use in games of X-wing miniatures& where it is an awesome little ship& and a decent model with interesting upgrade cards."
1565,531,5," Im a fan of the Xwing game so im naturally bias& but not being able to get my hands on a falcon this helps with the need for a big ship& the pilots are good and the abilities of this craft help level the playing field. Great combos with upgrades to be had here :)"
1566,531,3," Its got a couple of tricks available but for the points this is not a resilient ship.It does come with 2 cards that do kick ass though. These are the Lando crew card and the Experimental Interface upgrade.If you stick both these on the Falcon... well lets just say you become able to survive lots and lots without giving up all your offence.As a ship you don't see it in many successful squad lists and thats not unjustified its average"
1567,531,4," Great looking ship& obviously not as iconic as the Falcon but still has character. I haven't used it in a game yet but am looking forward to getting it on the table."
1568,531,4," Well made& a little light but all that i expected. Fits nicely in to the game."
1569,531,5," A good expansion with good cards and abilities. And it looks good too."
1570,532,4," I love the arkham city figures and like other reviewers i was surprised by how small this figure is. The figure is smaller than the penguin but it is a must buy for any arkham city fan and it looks great with my other figures on display."
1571,532,5," I think the detail on this figure is super &a great addition to my collection.Would recommend to any similar collecter"
1572,532,1," Terrible!opened up on Christmas day morning& and one if his arms was off!"
1573,532,5," Item was delivered quickly and looks great!"
1574,533,5," amazing figure& i'm a huge fan and have amassn 8 year olded a huge collection of figures over the years and these particular figures rival the original comic figures that neca released a few years ago (which i also own) and looking at this in my display cabinet sends me back to being an 8 year old boy lol& i will be collecting the others soon as pennies will allow& it is well worth the money"
1575,533,5," Amazing figure. If I seen these figures as a kid& my head would've exploded!"
1576,533,5," Excellent"
1577,534,5," Arived within the timeframe and is exactly what I payed for& theyre adorable! Pretty sure they are also legit& this seller seems trustworthy"
1578,535,4," Bought this for my daughter as she was looking for a unicorn for Christmas. She seems to love it and plays with it a lot. I thought it was very good value as you get two  figures which stand on their own. In most of the sets& the fairies cannot stand on their own if you take them off the horse. For her first pieces I thought she would get more enjoyment& if she had two clearly separate figures.Very happy and will definitely be adding to the collection for my daughter's birthday."
1579,535,5," These are absolutely gorgeous. Bought for my grand-daughter for her 4th bday as couldnt find a 'real-life' one haha. I will continue to add to the collection she has. Thank you"
1580,535,5," Great vfm and awesome gift for kids"
1581,536,4," As my son loves the film so much& I thought I would buy him the figures& he loves Boris! The actual figure is very hardy& which it needs to be with a 7 yr old boy playing with it& but he has lost the little bits that go with the figure."
1582,537,5," fast delivery great service needed this to complete the set& good price. My son loves these characters and max was sold out in every shop i tried"
1583,538,5," This toy is absolutely amazing-it's just 100% good! I was in the toilet-so i couldn't tell when it was here& so my dad picked it. Then when i was out& i was totally surprised that the toy was already here! On to the detail:Lots of detail& like the shoulder pads and design on legs!Articulation: around 20 points of articulation. This one has elbows allowing it to hold the gun at a fit pose!Accessories: The rifle as in the game-really cool figure& i enjoyed it! Wish it came with the pistols...(The figure is just over 7 inches& good for display!!!)"
1584,538,5," My son will love this& great articulation and attention to detail.Cool figure"
1585,538,5," Perfect."
1586,538,5," happy with product"
1587,539,5," There are numerous hired gun packs for the Star Wars Imperial Assault board game.  Each one contains the relevant figures finely cast in high-quality plastic and all of the additional rules and cards required to use them in the main game.Imperial Assault can be played in either campaign or skirmish mode and all of the character packs are fully compatible with each other.  They're a great idea and a fantastic way of expanding the game."
1588,539,5," Currently my favourite character in the excellent Imperial Assault& he's a beast& and comes with excellent campaign and skirmish missions as well as other powerful cards for the game. The figure is beautifully sculpted as always and was a joy to paint."
1589,539,5," I like this guy a lot. Very detailed miniature that gives you plenty of chances to create a unique look. Amazing when fully painted."
1590,539,5," Son was very pleased with this. Was delivered when it said it would be. Very pleased."
1591,539,5,""
1592,540,5," This fantastic figure is greatly detailed and has brilliant articulation. The removable poncho fits perfectly just as the sword fits in the sheath. The only downfall is that the figure can have the sheath under the poncho not over so Michonne can not wear the poncho and carry her sword on her back but over all a fantastic figure a must for all walking dead fans."
1593,540,1," shipped from japan and just caught the last day or expected arrival& more importantly this figure came with a black spot that covered the figures mouth (this isnt regular because i have another one from ebay) a large black mark over the lips that completely ruins the figure and the look of it! felt like they sent a badly manufactured release& or it was an asian fake& highly disappointing!"
1594,540,5," Big fan of the comics& so I was really looking forward to seeing her in the show. Had to get this because I actually don't have any figurines yet and I wanted to start with something and someone I'm very passionate about!"
1595,540,5," Son loves all walking dead one of fave character good likeness. Really pleased and adding to his growing zombie collection."
1596,540,5," I like this product that is good. I like it. the product is perfect and  it looks very cool and nice."
1597,541,5," This figure is pure perfection. It is absolutely worth the money& in fact I would even be ready to pay twice or three times more for such a collector. I had never seen so many details on a figure or a doll before. The painting and the texture make the hard plastic feel almost like real skin : it is rough& you can see blue veins and age spots on it... More than a manufactured product& it actually looks like a piece of art. Besides it is a limited edition& so if you are a big fan of LOTR& get yours while the stock lasts.Smeagol stands well and I think he is durable& but as for the posability... Well it takes some getting used to& but most reviewers on the internet said he can pose very well. What is sure is that once you get him& you simply cannot take your eyes off him !"
1598,541,5," Bought this to go with the NECA Bilbo B aggins figure I bought. Glad I did! This is as good as Bilbo. If you have one& you have to buy the other. They look great displayed together. Excellant figure& excellant likeness& excellant value. 5*s"
1599,541,5," Love it"
1600,542,5," This is possibly the best Optimus Prime figure I have! Very detailed& very articulated& and extremely accurate to the CGI model! Would recommend this to anyone that looks for accuracy in figures!"
1601,542,5," My son loves it already in a glass case"
1602,543,4," Quite small to be honest but my son loves his figures and that's all that counts so thumbs up for me."
1603,544,5," Very detailed& strong and my 3 and 5 year old places with this in there castles for ages.. Good price& very fast delivery im very happy"
1604,544,5," new knight great detail. the kids are going have lot of fun with there new world of knights and fantasy"
1605,544,5," Completes the set & perfect...."
1606,544,5," well made loved by my grandson"
1607,544,5," Just what he wanted& Great."
1608,545,5,""
1609,545,5," The blade on this specific lightsaber is not detachable. That is something I did not originally realize. I had purchased a lightsaber with a removable blade prior and assumed they all had removable blades so you can display the hilt without the bulb. If you are looking for removable blades make sure its stated in the description. Otherwise watch the video I had my Husband do of his new toy I purchased him. Any questions? ask away!"
1610,545,5," I bought one of these not knowing what to expect but I was very surprised with what I got.With the lights turned out you would think that it is real the remastered sound effects are amazing and the metal hilt feels great it also comes with a stand to mount it on if you are a Star Wars fan this is a definite buy.Well worth the money 10/10"
1611,545,5," This product isa mazing& the detailing on the lightsaber is superb! The sounds are authentic and it is a hell of a lot of fun to swing it around!The mount looks good and is easy to mount on a wall. The lightsaber hangs above the TV where it looks just great. But every once in a while I just have to pic it up and swing it around a bit."
1612,546,4," good product"
1613,547,5," This great& my Grandaughter loves it& it is so good for keeping her busy everyone in the family is wearing a bracelet (including the dog)"
1614,547,5," i bought this kit to share with my 9 year old niece. we are both very good at making bracelets with the round wheels& it is so easy. we were more interested in the square wheels which we had not seen before. the square wheels make completely different bracelets and we have had so much fun making bracelets for swapping at camps. the threads are lovely colours and very good quality and there is plenty of them. my niece loves the carry case. recommended for any crafter."
1615,547,5," I bought this for an 8 year old& who has every technical phone& games console& etc& so I wasn't sure how a conventional 'make it yourself' gift would be received. But it was a big hit!"
1616,547,4," This is a very good kit& however rated it as a 4 instead of 5 as its a bit complicated to start with& once you get the hang of it its ok but be prepared for very fiddly measuring and cutting of thread!  Does keep them quiet for a good while though and end result is very nice."
1617,547,4," My only complaint with this otherwise excellent kit is that the instructions came in several languages and thus weren't that detailed.  I managed to download a copy of the instructions from the manufacturer's website and they were only in English and much clearer - the other languages for each step took up a lot of room& thus preventing more detailed information.  Otherwise& a super selection of threads and the foam wheels are sturdy and make great bracelets - one you get the hang of it!"
1618,547,4," I bought this for my ten year old grand daughter who loves to make pretty things. It should give hours of enjoyment"
1619,547,5," I am an adult and I bought this for myself. The box is packed with everything you need to make bracelets of all shapes and designs. Highly recommend it for both young and old crafters."
1620,547,5," I gave this to my 9-year-old granddaughter for Christmas& and she spent a couple of hours& straightaway& making her first cords.  She was thrilled that she could use beads with the threads& as she's in to making bead bracelets for herself and her friends& and this will enable her to do something a little different.  I use threading plates like this for Kumihimo& so I'm used to the technique.  This would be a good starter set for an adult as well as for children."
1621,548,4," This is for my creative candles and is just what i needed. it arrived on time and in perfect condition. I paid more than I wanted to but this was something specific I was looking for."
1622,548,5," Used these to add on to my wedding veil they are small and look beautiful  thank you."
1623,548,5," These beads are perfect for my greeting cards& and delivery was prompt& thank you."
1624,549,5," Bought this tub for my 7 year old daughter who is thrilled to bits . Brilliant value tub with all the colours you need to make your designs.  Very good value for money and arrived super quick.  Thanks"
1625,549,5," This is a great value tub of beads with a good mix of colours.  There are no boards& no ironing paper and no free Rolls Royce included.  Don't buy this tub if you were after non-advertised extras."
1626,549,5," You just can't go wrong with Hama Beads.  We've had hours and hours of entertainment with these things and my children' fascination with these beads and their limitless potential for creativity shows no sign of waning."
1627,549,5," I disagree with the previous review& NOWHERE does it state that you get boards supplied with this item& unless you purchase a HAMA KIT you have to buy the boards SEPERATELY.Hama items are great fun for all ages& I am 36 and use them in crafting and card making.THey have a multitude of uses& with or without the boards you can buy.Not really suitable for little fingers& but they do cater for the younger ones with larger versions of this popular bead."
1628,549,5," I order this product which turned up very quickly with now problems good value for money. would recommend to others"
1629,549,5," Oh such fun! Hours of creating beautiful pieces to hang up&wear&decorate with and so on. Once ironed with a bit of parchment paper my daughter created some really fun coasters."
1630,549,1," Came quickly but the description is not accurate as it is just a tub of beads and does not come |with a few pegboards.| Would be a very disappointing present!"
1631,549,5," Great productChildren love these beadsPlay for hoursCan make so many things with theseTry them and seeYou won't be disappointed"
1632,550,4," Good but some beads were filled in the middle meaning the string wouldn't go through. I had to poke them with a pin but this isn't ideal for a child.Prompt delivery and the beads and colours were lovely& very girly!"
1633,551,5," Bought this Hama pegboard as part of a birthday present&now bringing lots of fun &it came as promised"
1634,552,5," I got this for my daughters christmas. We did this today as it's rainy and she's bored  . The chandelier looks so incredibly pretty ! The gems do stick but some of the glue stayed put -however all you need to do is peel off the gum glue and stick on gems. All gems stayed stuck perfectly. However only drawback is that it needs  dry markers to colour. We used felt tip pens but they didn't work as the ink shrinks off the plastic. Thankfully I have craft pens for use on ceramics/glass and that stayed put. We put a hook above her bed and hung the chandelier. It so beautiful and perfect as it lights up a when  she climbs into bed and will be handy for toilet visit at night with the automatic sensor."
1635,552,2," Not as good as expect gems don't stick and doesn't light up as well as the advert we also had cracked dangly pieces waste of money really wish I never bought it ."
1636,552,5," ordered this& came quick& not put up yet& but Im sure it will look lovely"
1637,552,5," Children enjoyed making the light and it looks great"
1638,553,5," they were great for what I do. Just peel them off and cut to size and easy to go round corners"
1639,553,5," Very fast delivery.  Quality item."
1640,554,5," The perfect box for little Hama Beads lovers& with it's pink packaging it's really girly. Just shop around for the right price on this particular set as it varies considerably."
1641,554,5," Bought as a birthday gift for my nine year old daughter who loved it. Excellent value for money"
1642,554,5," Perfect for my 5 year old granddaughter. She loved it."
1643,554,5," Grandchildren thrilled"
1644,555,3," Just as expected as have used these templates before"
1645,555,5," Lovely product and service. Thank you."
1646,555,5," bought for granddaughter. She loves it"
1647,556,5," daughter loves drawing on this"
1648,557,5," As per my other reviews of these sequin projects& my daughter has thoroughly enjoyed this one.  Unfortunately some of the sequins were a little short supply but we used our imagination and moved a couple around so that you wouldn't notice.Having done a number of these projects now& I would highly recommend a small box to keep all the pins in and only opening the sequin packets as you need them.  Keep any leftovers for the next project too. There is always a little sequin decoration left on the carpet but it is not generally a messy project and keeps my 10 year old occupied for a long time.They may seem a little pricey for what you get but it is a quality product and a project that keeps your child occupied for a long time as well as having pride in the final creation.These are now standard pressies on all xmas and birthday lists.Highly recommmended - although my daughter is 10 years old& I would think that with some help any age from 8 onwards would find this a lovely present."
1649,557,5," I love doing sequin art.  I'm a 36 year old woman who finds that sticking pins into styrofoam can be very relaxing.  And at the end I have a beatiful and shiny picture for my wall.  This will be my 3rd one that I've done.  I can't wait to see it hanging on my wall with the others."
1650,557,3," Bought this for my mother-in-law when she started this she couldn't finish it because she never had enough pins please can you post extra pins so it can be completed Thank you"
1651,557,4," Great gift idea and really addictive!  Only problem was that there is nowhere near enough sequins to complete it.  We ran out of white& pink& turquiose and dark blue so we couldn't even improvise with the remaining black& orange and green!"
1652,557,4," Sequin Art and bead Swans  HELP! i cannot complete I am around 200 pins short - please send me some more"
1653,558,2," The product is not what was expected at all - it is okay in quality& but definitely NOT in colour.The colour is definitely not as you would expect when someone says |metallic|.  Metallic suggest a shiny bright finish to the product that reflects light.The *silver* is grey.  The *gold* is flesh colour - almost the same as a normal rubber band.Upon closer inspection of the pictures& when you zoom in& the pictures do reflect the real colour& although it seems to be a lot brighter.  The normal picutre without the zoom looks a lot brighter than the loom bands actually are.If you are looking for 600 grey and flesh coloured loom bands& these are ideal.If you are looking for 600 metallic gold and silver loom bands& these are NOT ideal at all.Purchase with care.  The product has been given 2 stars due to the poor description.  Had it been accurately described& and ordered based on that& it would rate much higher.On a side note& the delivery was on time& and the product was well packaged."
1654,558,1," These bands are not as described!! They are in no way |metallic|. The Silver is more grey in colour and the |gold| can only be described as carmel.... On top of all that& at least 50 of my |gold| bands were snapped already and a lot more were uneven& slim on one side and fat on the other. I didn't even bother using them and definitely wouldn't recommend at all."
1655,558,5," arrived in good time and was exactly what my grand daughter wanted"
1656,558,1," NOT metallic they are Matt grey and a beige colour. Took a week and half to arrive. Suppose you get what you pay for."
1657,558,1," These do not come packaged as described as mixed bags and are NOT metallic"
1658,558,1," Very poor. the ones described as silver were |ok|&  but the gold were different sizes and and half were already broken in bag when arrived. I will think twice before purchasing again& very disappointed."
1659,558,5," Quick delivery& good quality and they do look very metallic :)"
1660,558,3," the packet included a mix of silver and gold bands. they are not sorted as indicated in a previous review. but it arrived quickly."
1661,559,5," lovely"
1662,560,5," Without doubt the best looms available. Having no knowledge about looming I bought a cheaper version which is now in the bin.  Looming is not that easy for younger children but these looms made the experience easier. The quality is instantly obvious.  The old saying buy cheap buy twice is definitely true for this product& highly recommend."
1663,560,5," Excellent.. They are well made& strong and contain everything you need to get started.. I would highly recommend getting these and other official Rainbow products as the cheaper ones are no where near as good."
1664,560,5,""
1665,560,5," My babies love it. Got this for my 6.5 year old and she shares it with her older sister. This was the original and I am happy I got it."
1666,560,5," I think this is amazing and a good product"
1667,561,5," Colours as depicted in the pictures. Even amount of beads per colour."
1668,561,5," Brilliant and thank you& its a shame we dont have these in the UK as we have Hama but not Perler."
1669,561,5," very pleased with item!"
1670,562,5," Let's get this straight& I purchased these for my daughter and she has enjoyed making designs to hang etc. However& it is my own use that has been surprising. I have found this 'toy' incredibly therapeutic and the things you can make are limited only by your own imagination. Even fat fingers like mine can play& although I do resort to tweezers sometimes.In summary& great fun for ALL the family& just don't let heavy-handed Dad do the 'ironing' as the beads and base melt VERY quickly and the base becomes unusuable if you melt the points too much. The greatest testament I can give this is to quote my daughter: |Daddy give my Hamabeads back!|"
1671,562,5," I bought these peg boards to accompany a tub of Hama beads for my daughter's birthday. They are just the job. Both my 5 year old daughter& and 17 year old step-daughter used the boards to create some lovely flowers. They spent ages playing with them& so I guess they are a success!"
1672,562,4," My daughter loves doing hama bead patterns. These peg board are of decent sizes& and very strong. Some boards go wonky after ironing& but not these. Good quality& very pleased"
1673,562,4," A great way to entertain kids. Obviously beads are needed too& but my lot have sat for hours since the age of 4 to 17 with Hama. No Tv required. Hint: Search Google images for some great Hama designs!!"
1674,562,5," These boards are so good but can use alot of beads if the kids decide to fill them so make sure you have a big box of hamma beads.  Purchased for my daughter and nieces and they love them."
1675,562,5," these boards have given the children a chance to use their imagination.. the shapes and creatures evolved from these boards are just amazing. thanks."
1676,562,5," perfect would recommend this product just as described and a high quality& great price for the quality. would order again when needed."
1677,562,5," my girls have hours of fun with these and with there friends so thank you so much and i tell everyone where i got them from"
1678,563,5," Top quality and good size product. We bought it for our 2 years old girl. We live in small apartment so size was important for us. She likes drawing on it very much and spends more time on it than drawing on paper. It is also quite fun bonding time for parent and child. The chalks which come with the board are great quality and size especially for small children. We just wipe the board after chalk use with wet wipes. We will be using it for many years to come."
1679,563,4," Sturdy& well finished& good large chalks"
1680,563,5," Excellent product! Good quality"
1681,564,5," Very economic pack& my children love it."
1682,565,4," I'm admittedly not the age of the usual target audience for such products& but bought some out of nostalgia and to settle a creative urge. I thought that this bucket was great value& I have made at least 20 things& some fairly large and I'm only about a third of the way down it.If I had any complaints& it's that there doesn't seem to be many black beads in it - a shame because I like to use them as an outline!No pegboards or paper with this& just the beads. Pegboards can be bought separately and grease proof paper can be used instead of having to spend more on the official Hama ironing paper.Overall I was very happy with this as a starter pack& found cheap packs of the black beads as well as brown and grey ones that I wanted online to top it up.The colours you get in this bucket are: Black& white& pink& purple& blue& orange& red& yellow& green and dark green."
1683,565,5," We have been huge fans of Hama beads and kits in this house for a couple of years now. My 7 year old makes bracelets and then melts down imaginative pendants for them. She has made picture frames& dolls for removable paper clothes and all sorts of peculiar looking monsters. One recent creation was a hama-bead charm bracelet! My 4 year old son makes pictures of cars& dinosaurs and traffic lights and then plays with them.It is a simple concept. Put small plastic beads onto a plastic board to make a picture. Use some baking paper to iron (on a low setting) to melt the beads together& and then peel the picture off. The |midi| beads are suitable for about 3 and a half to 10 (or over. I'm addicted...) you can get much larger beads for smaller children& and much smaller beads for older children and adults. I haven't tried either& and we are sticking to |midi| beads for now.There are also the kits with the instructions on how to create the intricate pattern to make really impressive pictures. It would be nice if the manufacturers had a website where they had a few more examples you can copy. I understand that you can get books and things& but we haven't looked at these yet.The only downside is that these creations by their very nature cannot last forever if you play with them constantly or wear them a lot. But truly this toy is an all round winner. Hours of peace for parents& creative play for youngsters& and a praiseworthy creation at the end.Okay& adults& you need to iron for a few seconds after the kids have finished their work& but it is not difficult and doesn't take any time.Read more â€º"
1684,565,5," This product is ideal for children as it allows them to use there imagination to create whatever they want& a must-have for the kids"
1685,565,5," I bought a box of these after searching Amazon for Christmas presents after reading the reviews and naÃ¯vely assuming that the boards required to put the beads on were supplied which I may add was not in the description but as I had never seen or heard about the beads before I hadn't known what to expect. Never mind the boards are inexpensive and totally reusable so the deficit when pointed out by my daughter& was soon rectified. I also assumed wrongly that it would only be my granddaughters who would be interested in the beads& but wrong again& both grandsons also like them. All four children have made a variety of imaginative things from the beads including necklaces& bracelets& table mats& nameplates& wall hangings and birthday greetings pictures for family and friends. All you need is some (reusable) grease proof paper plus an iron and one responsible person& usually a Nana (or similarly qualified person) to drop everything they are doing instantaneously to iron the beads. Actually on Hama bead days I recommend imposing a twice daily arrangement whereby creations can be left at a designated spot and then ironing done in batches. Finishing one item takes about 2 mins. For greater stability (if permitted by the artist)& I tend to iron both sides. Using the beads is great when friends come to play as all ages can create things together according to their skill level without feeling in any way left out and with so many beads in a box they last for ages. The shaped boards eg butterfly's or dolphins etc are nice as give a good shape to the designs but are not necessary but do get some large boards for making multiple similar designs eg flowers used for gluing onto a plant pot to decorate it. At the price offered a box of these would make a good gift for many different occasions eg gift for one child to take to another child's birthday party."
1686,565,5," If you are buying Hama beads I would strongly suggest getting this set. The beads will probably land up everywhere& but at least with this big tub you can keep them all together after you've scooped them up with a brush and pan. There are a large variety of colours to choose from in the set but I also bought some extra glow in the dark ones to compliment it.The quality of these beads is great and they're really good value. The tub makes it nice and easy to pack them away after kids may get bored with them (they don't seem to stay bored with them for long though!).Highly recommended."
1687,566,5," Great quality and just as expected."
1688,566,5," Love the colours will buy more"
1689,567,5," Great for little ones between 4 and 10Would not give to girls over 10 as it is a bit basic& but good value for money"
1690,567,5," excellent for budding nail artists!  The whole family had a manicure on Christmas day"
1691,567,5," My seven year old loves this set& plenty of nail art choices to experiment with. Excellent inexpensive birthday/Christmas present gift idea."
1692,567,3," the problem doing these reviews for me is& I cant remember how much I paid for said item & and there is not next to this box.so id say its good fun& little girl loves it. but not worth more than& Â£7."
1693,567,4," Nice gift - good value lots of items in box."
1694,567,5," great gift for a little girl and super fast delivery"
1695,567,5," Bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it."
1696,567,4," This was packed very well. Am pleased with how it all looks its a gift for my daughter and I'm sure she will enjoy it"
1697,568,5," Both product and delivery were great.  Perfect for making |school bracelets|."
1698,568,5," Very good quality just what I needed and arrived quickly."
1699,568,5," great value will guy again"
1700,568,5," As expected"
1701,568,5," :)"
1702,569,5," Great value"
1703,569,5," These bands are just as good as any and are a fraction of the price. My boys are more than happy with them :0)"
1704,569,5," I was expecting it to be just a massive bag of mixed bands but it wasn't. It was better! It contained: 2 mixed normal band packs (each contained 600 bands)& 2 mixed glittery band packs (each contained 600 bands)"
1705,569,5," we have spent all day sorting them in to colours and making them for everyone we know& granny will be thrilled - as we are.thankyou"
1706,569,5," Daughter loved the bands& kept her amused for hours sorting them into all the different colours.  Well worth the money!"
1707,569,4," Great quality& star service by seller and are being enjoyed by my children making the bracelets& will most certainly recommend and this is the second time we buy from this seller."
1708,569,5," Great loom bands& 5 packs of 600 - delivered within 2 days of ordering. Fantastic service all round!"
1709,569,5," Brilliant quality found maybe 4 broken ones in the whole pack very impressed as you can find some really poor quality loom bands some places!!"
1710,570,5," very happy"
1711,571,5," Will keep the grandkids amused."
1712,572,5," just what i needed for my jewellery making well made and so worth the price will be getting more from this seller"
1713,573,5," This product comes in an attractive |suitcase| and contains a wide variety of craft equipment to encourage younger children to use their creative skills& and provides endless fun. The case can be refilled with more crafty bits and pieces as items are used. My 5 year old granddaughter spent most of Christmas day playing with it - it was a real favourite."
1714,573,5," Granddaughter loved it."
1715,574,5," My grandaughter has had a lot of fun with these"
1716,575,3," it arrived very quickly& i loved the box it comes with. when i was ordering it on Amazon it show that it is a loom from the brand 'rainbow loom' but mine came with a loom and hook from the brand 'krazy looms' very disappointed by that. if your big into rainbow loom like my daughter then you will know how different brands that sell rainbow loom can make them very different and not as good quality as the original rainbow loom brand. the bands didn't make a difference. i also got a pack of coloured s-clips and a none coloured pack which i didn't mind. on Amazon it does not show any branding on the box but it came with full branding from the company krazy looms"
1717,575,5," I do not write reviews often& just purely because they are tedious. This Product however deserves one.Could not be happier with the producs and is exactly like the original rainbow looom board. The only difference is the arrows arent coloured in ornage but are clear other than that it is exactly like the picture shows. The only thing to bear in mind is that the collours are a little duller than in the image shown but not by a great deal! Still that does not deny the fact that this is the best kit you can buy on amazon. Comes with storage box& loom tool (like the original plastic rainbow one)& the loom and plenty of bands and C-clips. I have now made 6 different (quite large bracelets all with tripple rows) and only now started running out of reds and black but for the rest of the collours& there are plenty left. You could easily make 20 odd single row bracelets from this kit if not more!  If you want the perfect starter kit or a kit as close to the original as posible then buy this product. Shipping and product were just perfect no hassle!"
1718,575,1," The item sent was not that seen in the picture. I am most disappointed with this as the loom board was different to the one in the photo. I bought this particular set because of the quality of the loom and the 13 peg rows& but I received a very inferior loom with only 10 pegs per row. Not big enough for my daughters designs. The case is also wrong. It was described as â€œ10 grid loom bandz kit storage caseâ€ and I have received a smaller 12 grid case. Based on this misrepresentation I am expecting a full refund."
1719,575,1," Loom board was the cheaper type with just four supports unlike the sturdier loom in photograph. Very dissappointed 10 year old who had selected this item based on the photograph advertising the product."
1720,575,5," Compact for easy storage. Useful tools. Great for all ages as the bracelets are easy to make and look graeat"
1721,575,5," Brilliant! Everything my 8year old daughter wanted and really quick delivery. Having them all in a box is great for storage."
1722,575,3," Product didn't include the hook or loom that are in the photo so I need to order elsewhere."
1723,575,5," It was everything we expected although it took longer than we expected to arrive but the end result was good so we're happy. Thank you. My daughter was thrilled with the product."
1724,576,5," Love the colours in this one!!! Arrived on time and they are the official Rainbow Loom Bands!!!"
1725,577,5," Honestly the best service I have received throughout all my recent product order. They are perfect and described so well through the photo. As if that was not enough however they enclosed a thank you gift for the custom I had given them which was the nicest suprise to recieve within my order and really just enphasised how good this seller is"
1726,577,5," I will definitely be buying more of these key charms....they are delightful.  Very detailed& I simply can't believe the price and HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM for all scrap bookers/card makers....In fact& everyone should have a secret key to a secret lock.....Measurements are: 1cm wide x 4cm long  (lightweight)"
1727,577,5," These small charms are even better than I had expected. They are excellent  quality. I am very pleased with them. I also got a free gift with them which was a pleasant surprise. I would definitely recommend this product."
1728,577,3," The keys were not large enough for reason I wanted them for& there were no measurements given to scale them by& but okay for jewellery& I needed keys that would open a lock."
1729,577,3," I think these were described as 'large' but this was misleading"
1730,578,5," My girls (4 and 6) love Hama beads and love Hello Kitty so this was always going to be a winner. We had got bored with out old Hama shapes and these create really nice sized kitties to play with or give away to friends.  Hama beads are great for keeping children absorbed for relatively long periods and improve their fine motor skills as soon as they're comfortable to pick them up."
1731,578,5," Bought this as a birthday gift for a friend of my daughters. The box contains two templates (approximately 20cm in height) for making up the Hello Kitty and Bunny. There are plenty of beads to make lots and lots of characters. The bag of beads also has a good proportion of extra white ones which are necessary for the characters faces. My own daughter loved the product and I think we will have to order these for her birthday!Good craft gift/product with enough beads to give hours of fun."
1732,578,5," Bought this for my 7 year old daughter.  She absolutely loves it.  She has made hello kitties for nearly every girl in her class at school and never seems to tire of this toy. It comes with loads of beads but because she makes so many of them we've had to buy some more white ones& and even though it is not an official hama product& their midi size beads can easily be used with this product.  For the amount of pleasure it has brought& I think it is really good value for money& especially seen as many hello kitty products are vastly overpriced and often of poor quality.  My only complaint would be that hello kitty's whiskers can sometimes fall off so I make sure that they get an extra ironing.  I also find ironing them on both sides make them a bit more sturdy."
1733,578,4," Great product. My daughter is a massive Hello Kitty fan and she was really pleased with this set. Like the Hama bead sets the beads are quite small so I wouldn't recommend it for young children."
1734,578,5," My daughter got this for Christmas& and loved it. She has made a few of the Hello kitty characters and my younger daughter also enjoyed it. Needs focus and care& my younger daughter did knock hers a few times which did upset her since she had to redo some of what she had done& but overall a great gift."
1735,578,5," Another fun craft item that went down well at christmas& gets the kids creative and thinking about where the different colour beads needs to go. A great  item."
1736,578,4," Bought this as a gift. But the recipient was very happy with it and started playing with the& the minute she opened up the gift box!"
1737,578,5," My 4 1/2 year old daughter is mad about Hello Kitty and her face lit up when she received this as a present. It kept her quiet for hours and she had great fun creating her own colours for the dresses. Cute and easy for little hands to create masterpieces. Ideal as a present."
1738,579,5," I had never seen these beads before but in struggling to entertain my 5 yr old son in the school holidays& i thought id give them a try.I have to say I think they are fantastic.Its hard to get boys to sit still for 5 minutes and concentrate but after initally giving my son a hand in learning the concept& he was doing it quietly on his own for ages!!...I shall definately be getting more of these to keep him occupied.Great buy."
1739,579,5," We purchased some more of these to help with my sons fine motor skills to improve his grip and handwriting skills.Its been a great way to have a bit of fun as well as aiding his hand gripping technique.My 4 year old has also enjoyed it although you would have to be careful with younger children being tempted to put the small pieces in there mouths."
1740,579,5," my 5 year old son loves cars and hama  beads... he really enjoyed doing this. Highly recommend a good buy(-:"
1741,580,4," We hunted high and low for these in our local stores and couldnt find them anywhere.  My daughter is loom crazy as is most of her school and these proved to be a big hit for creating interesting patterns."
1742,580,5," The knotting tool that came with it is really useful. Bands are strong and can be used for a lot of creations which is really good."
1743,580,5," We had a really quick response to our order which arrived within 2 days using the standard postage. The bands are really good quality and the loom band fans in this house love them."
1744,580,4," The bands were delivered very quickly and came with a handy little tool as well as the hook and clips"
1745,580,5," These are very good bands and don't break& will keep boys and girls happy for hours"
1746,580,4," Good value"
1747,580,4," Kids happy with new loom bands.  Great fun for the holidays."
1748,580,5," Item arrived as described. Good VFM."
1749,581,5," These are very nice beads and good value for money.  THey're very pretty in the flesh and a good purchase."
1750,582,5," Great product - delivered very quickly  too - very happy daughter"
1751,582,5," Really good"
1752,582,5," Very good"
1753,583,5," Great idea for the sequin lovers great value for money and great postage ."
1754,583,5," excellent"
1755,583,5," Great"
1756,584,5," Draughtier plays with these for hoursf"
1757,585,2," the pack itself is fine but if i had looked closer at the images i would have realised that the picture templates are actually round.....and the starter pack we have has square trays.....so they dont fit.  Why have they done this????  Now i have to buy a whole new pack just to get the circular trays to use the new pictures with.As for the drying time etc. we have found the best way is to soak the beads (ie about 10 sprays) when you've finished your design and leave it to dry over night.  That way the finished article doesnt fall to pieces and are pretty sturdy."
1758,585,5," Cheaper alternative to some others on the market& Beado's are good. They come with a few templates to copy and a spritzer for wetting the beads. If you over wet they get very sticky and annoying& if you underwet they don't stick. gotta get it right!!"
1759,585,5," This is a great addition to beados that we have. This is a scene pack which comes together really well.  If your a beado novice you will need a main kit for the beado spray bottle and pen which makes putting the beads in far easier. You can do it without the pen but takes much longer. Once all your beads are in place simply spray and leave to dry. I find these stick really well and have never had any issues of them falling apart. These are fun for all the family."
1760,585,1," Do not purchase this refill if you have the circle beado try's as they do not fit. Very dissapointed little girl who cannot use the designs& even after cutting them to make them fit the circle trays they don't line up to allow you to place the beads."
1761,585,1," Does not come with everything pictured and you have to buy another pack to be able to use it. If this was ever sold at RRP it was a joke. Even at half price it's not worth the money. Read the description very carefully ."
1762,585,4," The one I got was different from the one I ordered which was a bit disappointing as she would have really liked the other one but my little one still liked the pack and made all the designs."
1763,585,3," Nice set. But beads are used up very quickly.  Would be good to have more beads in set and maybe a tweaser pen too."
1764,585,4," Excellent value& shame it's a 'styles may vary' but we were happy with the puppy set we had."
1765,586,5," Loved as a birthday present for our granddaughter."
1766,586,5," I thought my granddaughter would love this for xmas. Obviously it hasn't been opened yet but we will see wednesday"
1767,587,1," Very poor quality product. cannot even use them for my customers.they were not printed properly& bits missing just very poor. Not impressed."
1768,587,5," Great item and great price"
1769,587,5," great value"
1770,587,5," look great"
1771,587,5," Brill"
1772,588,5," Great 2 part epoxy this is a suitable alternative to XTC-3D suitable for finishing and smoothing striations on PLA/ABS 3D Prints"
1773,588,5," I wanted this to coat the surface of 3D prints to help with smoothing away the layers. This has worked well. It needs more than the 30 minutes before it is hard enough to be sanded& I usually wait 24 to 48 hours. It sands nicely and I can get a good finish."
1774,588,5," I always struggle with sticky tubes& clogged up caps etc. so this is a good buy because the caps are easy to use and the two bottles don't require a single plunger to dispense uneven quantities. It also does what it says and sticks after 30 mins."
1775,588,5," This product is not sold in Japan.It seems that many guitar builder of Japan have used this product regularly.I am also pleased."
1776,589,5," A nice large container with good quality pegs. Haven't counted to check whether there are in fact 1000 but there are certainly enough for several children to complete boards without running out. Would recommend."
1777,589,5," I have lots of these boards as they are great for pattern making& but I had lost too many pegs over the years. This pack was a great replacement with lots of pretty colours."
1778,589,5," I needed instant basic Montessori maths to take for my 6-year-old grandson abroad and this package was delivered by return. Brilliant. This is an excellent product that I have child-tested before"
1779,589,5," My daughter got this for her 7th birthday and she loves them& quite expensive for just one board with it but it made my daughter happy so worth it"
1780,589,3," Good quality and is what it is but I thought quite expensive for what it was.Speedy delivery good buy in all thank you"
1781,589,4," My three year old enjoys playing with this. It helps with fine motor skills and is one of the only things that he will concentrate on for quite a length of time. It's not quite five stars as the board is small compared to the amount of pegs you get."
1782,589,3," I would have preferred a few peg boards didn't realise it only came with one. think maybe two should be supplied with the price of this"
1783,590,5," Definitely get this& has all the bits you need and more plus sprkley beados& so good and great value& i have just gotten a second one for her so as she has more of the balls to fit on top of the pen and of course the sparkley beados."
1784,590,5," Granddaughter loves them hours of fun"
1785,590,1," Warning - this isn't Beados as described.Looks very similar but is a different brand with no English on the box.Very dissapointed"
1786,590,1," Really not very pleased to have received a foreign version& wouldn't have minded quite so much if it wasn't for a birthday present. No idea whether the instructions will even have an English section on them! Not very useful if not."
1787,590,4," It was worth the money and nice things were made."
1788,590,2," Very expensive for what it is! I expected more in a starter set. The beads took ages to set& were sticky and a nightmare to move. From what I've seen the other brand of a similar product may be a better option."
1789,590,5," My daughter loves Beados and this ones comes with a pen that makes using them much easier to work with.  This is a winner for me and I'd recommend. Plus every girl loves glitter& so what more can you ask for!"
1790,590,4," This is a fun toy& has small&pieces so not for the little ones but it is easy to do& just make sure you leave them to dry long enough"
1791,591,4," Christmas present which was very well received."
1792,591,5," Bought as a present"
1793,591,4," grandaughter loves it"
1794,592,5," Great price looks ok"
1795,592,5," As expected"
1796,592,5," good value"
1797,593,4," It was great for my year 7 experiment& behaving predictably when heated and cooled!"
1798,593,5," good stuff"
1799,593,4," It's plastercine& what else can I say- nice assortment of colours. have always thought play dough was a poor relation."
1800,594,5," My 4 year old has been asking for Hama Beads for a while now so we got this pack for her& for Christmas. It's the perfect starter set with various peg boards& illustrations and a choice of beads. She never seems to tire of them. This box was great value for money and I'd recommend them to anyone wanting to start their Hama Bead collection."
1801,594,5," This large box arrived in an even larger box!  I bought it for my grand daughter's 5th birthday next week as her mother said she has played with something similar and really enjoyed.  I've given it a high rating as it comes with plenty of templates and the beads are all colour separated.  Seems like a lot of scope for creative play and good value for the money.  Just hope her 18 month old sister doesn't get her hands on it!"
1802,594,5," got these for my 5 year old neice - she loved them.  big shaped boards gave her loads of ideas of things to make and it was surprising how enthralled she was - has kept her entertained for hours"
1803,594,5," Bought this for my 4 year olds biorthday& she had already tried beads from a high street craft shop and was thrilled with these.We particulary liked that the coloured beads were separated into colours and easily accessible inthe divided box in comes with.  THe patterns were a little hard for her to follow but if helped she has created the designed featured. Otherwise she fills the templates in in her own colour scheme.  We now have a large number of picture bead creations scattered around our house& from teddy bears to home designed coasters for her to use.THe iron well just be careful to fully cover the board and beads or else they will stick to the iron.  I have needed to go over them several times with the iron before they have bonded.My six year old son also adores these& and we have all spent hours sitting down doing this activity together.  Even when their friends have come round"
1804,594,5," Got this set for my 4yr old daughters birthday. She loves hama beads and this is a great set. It comes with a nice selection of boards and its good having all the coloured beads in little trays. This would be an ideal first set or an additional one as it was for us. I would definitely recommend it."
1805,594,5," A great present for my neice for christmas. Wasted something she could access fairly independently and she loves it. Lots of things to make and loads of beads."
1806,594,5," Great value and quality& my son 7 and daughter 4 love it and it has inspired their imaginations and art skills.  Highly recommend  A+++++++++++++"
1807,595,5," After my little boys recieved the Hama UFO Glow Mobile set for Xmas& we can't seem to make any Hama creations without having some glowing element in there! Therefore& we've had to buy several new packs of night-glow beads& of which this is one.Out of the different glowing colours the red beads tend to glow the most brightly& closely followed by the green. Even though these look a bit pink and |girlie| in the daytime& (according to my little boys)& by night they really do glow a fantastic red colour and the glow lasts quite a while. The packet that they come in seems really small - but there are supposedly 1000 beads in there& (I haven't bothered counting to check!!)& and they really will last and last. All in all I would say that these are really worthwhile if your children would like to jazz up their Hama creations and have masterpieces that they can enjoy by night too...and despite the teeny looking package& I think they're pretty good value too!"
1808,595,5," These are great to add to the other beads by Hama& I bought these for my niece and nephew and they were entertained for hours.They are really useful as the colour red is so useful when you are creating some of the lovely different designs that are available (seperately). The range is amazing that Hama have for both boys and girls."
1809,595,5," Granddaughter loves these beads. Bought her several colours for christmas. Personally I am not sure what you do with them!"
1810,595,3," These beads have a lovely coloured glow but unfortunately it doesn't last it disappeared really quickly."
1811,595,4," Hours of entertainment for a 7yr old"
1812,596,4," Bought for a 3+ Niece as a Chrimbo present.  Her parents thought this would good for her to handle as the parts were not too small."
1813,597,5," very pretty colours& mostly of yellow and blue with a few purple and green."
1814,597,5," Great bargain son loves them"
1815,597,5," |S| clips are great but to get the coloured ones is even better&  My girls love them"
1816,598,5," Got the pins in post today all in good condition thank you."
1817,598,5," Great product and great service"
1818,599,5," I bought these as I am making Christmas ornaments with Hama beads& they were delivered quickly and are a beautiful& Christmassy shade of red that will get lots of use."
1819,599,2," not what i thought they were and to big for the required use my error in choosing"
1820,599,5," No problem with this product."
1821,599,5," Great price and service"
1822,600,5," Fast and accurate"
1823,600,5," r wat they r"
1824,600,4," as expected"
1825,601,2," Good item on teh whole ... although the gold tiles weren't as impressive in the overall result as I'd hoped and had to be used very sparingly"
1826,601,3," Parents nightmare thes things...which is why I bought them for grandkids...revenge!!! lol Hving already bought a box of the se kind of beads realised not enough Gold ones for grandson to make an Iron man figure& I think 1000 extra should be enough! lol"
1827,601,4," I brought these for making some christmas tree decorations.  Once ironed they are still gold looking but not as brilliant a gold as I would have liked."
1828,601,3," Beads look  a bit small and might be difficult to thread - I'm not sure about these.  I will know when I have the time to try them out."
1829,601,5," We've used this for Christmas decorations and robots and found they hold their colour better post ironing than their silver cousins"
1830,601,1," The ends of the beads are brown& not gold& and brown is the effect once ironed. Not worth buying.Very disappointed."
1831,601,5," Needed these for Christmas.  Thought they would make things look very festive."
1832,601,5," My children love being creative with the beads ...great beads ..great service"
1833,602,5," These chunky beads are ideal for younger children. A good little set -  well priced."
1834,602,5," Perfect for children who can't quite do the smaller beads yet!"
1835,603,3," My daughter really liked the look of this one& having done others. However the quality is very poor with the two polystyrene half moulds not glued together squarely& resulting in the front and back being out of line by about 5mm."
1836,603,5," My daughter loved it and done in 2 days"
1837,603,5," ok"
1838,603,5," liked"
1839,604,5," Very pleased with this Slate and Chalk set."
1840,605,5," I love these! They are the perfect size for a necklace I made& one I got loads of compliments for! Will buy again if I need more!"
1841,605,5," Good for putting tiny crystals into. Keeps them intact. Pretty but small. Quick delivery.."
1842,606,5," Fantastic easel. After spending some time looking for one that adjusted in height& had a paper holder and a magnetic side I finally came across this one.  This ticks all the (my) boxes.  It is very well made and attractive. The blackboard works well.  The white board is magnetic.  There are bars to hold the paper flat and a large tray to hold crayons etc. My little 18 month old can use it comfortably at the lowest height setting and because it can be adjusted she will be using it for years to come."
1843,606,5," Bought as a Christmas present for a two year old and it looks like it will be a big hit for years to come. I spent a lot of time looking at the options for a child's whiteboard/easel. I wanted a magnetic whiteboard on one side& chalkboard on the other (tick!). More than anything& I wanted it to be stable so it wouldn't get knocked over and have the user fall down on top or underneath it. I'm happy with this - seems to be more stable than its competitors and it's solidly made. The suggestion I would make is that it would benefit from non-slip feet. This is probably not an issue on carpet but we've got hard floors. The paper roll holder is a great idea& though painting on the whiteboard side seems like a recipe for getting paint on the whiteboard& which might be a problem.I think this product is great value - it was around Â£55 when bought. There are cheaper options& but they're not made of wood and many of them looked flimsy. What's missing is that it didn't come with a lot of accessories. I bought a Quercetti |tablet| product that had magnetic letters& numbers and picture tiles so that (1) we had accessories to go with this easel and (2) as something so that we could essentially take the same toy on the road. I also bought dry-wipe pens and chalk separately. It would have been a good idea for these to be included. It also needs paint and paintbrush.Overall& it looks great and does the job - more importantly& it was a hit with the young man I gave it to."
1844,606,5," I have it all the summer now. It is the size perfect for my 3 years old boy and he is a tall boy.. we have it in the minimum setting now. Another thing I am happy is that it does not take so much space as I thought. Hape it is very environmental friendly so highly recommend it. The only bad thing I can find is that you cannot use it with Ikea paper rolls."
1845,606,5," I was looking for an adjustable easel& that would hold paper& with a magnetic board and chalk side. This fulfilled all of these requirements. It arrived within a day and fitted together easily. We still have to use it as ordered chalk& pens etc separately and waiting for them to arrive. It is really well made and great for a 2 and 4 year old to play at the same time. The paper is hard to thread through so needs an adult to help. Wider paper would also be useful (44cm wide) to stop the kids drawing on the White board. It is good to have a bar to secure the paper at the bottom too so it does not move. Overall very pleased with it and feel it was the best choice on the market for what I wanted. Other option was waiting for the magnetic version of the Melissa and Doug easel released later this year."
1846,606,3," But quite pricey.  I ordered two for granddaughters' Christmas presents& one was absolutely fine& the second had a damaged whiteboard which we have been unable to replace because the item is out of stock. I have been given a complete refund so I am happy about that& although it took nearly 3 months to sort.  Would therefore find it difficult to recommend."
1847,607,4," She has great fun with her friends to decorate her nails and feels really a Monster High& the only reason I did not give five stars is that the box arrived slightly crushed (I guess by the Post) but the fun was there"
1848,607,5," Bought for Grandaughter who loved it& she was well pleased and was kept very busymaking different nail designs& was pleased with it."
1849,607,5," Excellent gift& my niece loves this and it's good fun for grown ups too!  Well worth the money as you get so much stuff"
1850,607,5," My daughter has had much fun with this&with her friends&mum and aunty.. really great gift& could be more varnish included&but other than that& good product."
1851,607,2," My daughter wasn't inspired by this set even though she is a monster high fan. She said that the plastic nails were uncomfortable."
1852,607,4," Wonderful birthday gift for young girl.  The packaging was good strong plastic but the box inside was slightly dented."
1853,607,4," Bought this item for my drank daughter she love doing her nails such pretty designs in this box would recommend"
1854,607,5," These are a fantastic idea my daughter bites her nails and with these hopefully she will see that her fingers look much better with nails of a decent length& thats my plan anyway lol"
1855,608,5," Brilliant& comes with  2 x boards& pen and four toppers&so each colour is placed on the top if the pen&and its very easy to pop on and take off&wish these were one to fit each colour&or sold separably&as the tiny balls&will roll out of the tiny small&button bag& no zip nothing to keep them together&maybe a box with dividers would help&They have a tiny brilliant spray bottle&and a funnel&All well planed out&ConNot enough beads they were all done in that moment&Not enough tops for each colour&The bags could be made bigger&as once open they roll out&They hold together and stay fixed&also I made a bundle it also stayed fixPlease note this also come under aqua beads&bindeez&gr8t&Japanese&they all fit each other all have either&Square or round trays& pens with compartments& Different type of pens&Look them upAlso they contain a taste&that stops them to be swallowed&as they are very dangerous when swelled&and hands should be washed after handling&Very very tiny rubber beads in a coating of some LSD format&no not swallow& maybe give them to a child that followsGiven instructions&and wash hands and wrist after use&Great fun stay safe"
1856,608,4," Came in time for Xmas and I know my daughter will be happy with them& however I'll be the one picking them up"
1857,608,5," I ordered this for my Granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it.  It's a really good quality toy to go with the starter pack and the price was very reasonable.  The delivery was on time and I would definitely order from this supplier again."
1858,608,4," daughter loves makeing these but including shops exspensive for what they are"
1859,608,5," Good refill set to go with existing bindees. Totally compatible."
1860,608,1," Bought these for my grandson to try& he has already had quixels which were great and he really enjoyed making things with them but these were very poor and didn't stick together very well at all. Very disappointing and would not buy again"
1861,608,5," Bought as a Christmas gift when it was enjoyed."
1862,608,5," This was a gift for my niece who's into creative crafts& being a tried and tested product& (meaning she already has many of the kits) the refill pack was an ideal gift for her to expand her creations."
1863,609,2," Quick dispatch of my order& however& the item I received was not the item that I ordered.  I ordered a pack of 300 Metallic Gold loom bands but I received a pack of 600 yellowy-brown loom bands (a similar colour to that of standard rubber bands)& which were neither metallic nor gold.I contacted the seller and received a prompt reply confirming the 'metallic gold' is actually 'caramel' and suggesting I return the product.I do think the Amazon listing is misleading.  If they aren't metallic gold but caramel in colour& they should be clearly listed as such and to this effect I am placing this feedback on Amazon to prevent other people having the same disappointment."
1864,609,5," Arrived very quickly. They are metallic silver& unlike some bands& which are grey. None have snapped& look great. Only downside& I wanted 600 but there was nowhere I could order 600 so had to order two packs of 300& but overall& very happy. Will order more."
1865,609,4," Great product matched my other gold looms bands I had previously& They even have a kinda sweet scent to it which I didn't expect. Super fast delivery!"
1866,609,1," Very poor quality. Not the same quality as the original bands that came with the set. More bronze than gold. No problems with seller though."
1867,609,3," These are better quality bands than the other loom bands but they are slightly larger too."
1868,609,4," Good bands strong"
1869,609,4," Perfectly wrapped and delivered on time. Was a little gutted that they were'nt more glittery& but still look great. Very happy."
1870,609,1," Not very impressed with the colour. They look like a packet of elastic bands I bought from the shop to go on jam jar covers. I wouldn't say they were gold nor metallic and I thought they might be ok for caramel but look nothing like the caramel ones I've already got. I've had similar issues with silver& glow in the dark& and a black which was dark grey when compared with other blacks."
1871,610,5," Fantastic value& quality item& far superior in quality to all the light flimsy ones out there. Pay well get quality. super fast shipping& well packaged.  highly recommend seller& A**********"
1872,611,3," Yes the Hama phenomenon. These are not the cheapest but my daughter was whining so I bought them late one night. These and their other coloured cousins keep her busy for hours. There are other non-Amazon retailers who sell them 30% cheaper and give you some of the new funky colours but it could take you a while to find them.These are the red ones and they bond when ironed as expected. They arrived quickly from Cheaper than Catalogues but I noticed the price has gone up by 15% since my order.Don't feed them to pets."
1873,611,5," Bought a giant box with lots of shapes.  Kept the grand daughters quiet for hours!  A great product that allows careful copying of patterns& or free imagination& not to mention the dexterity!  Now buying the spare beads in their favourite colours."
1874,611,5," Very good quality and melts well when ironed. Would recommend to anyone who does hama beads as a hobby. You should buy it."
1875,611,3," beads are as expected. Hama beads are easy to use and always successful when used properly. will buy again in the future"
1876,611,5," Excellant would buy again and have done ..."
1877,611,5," Received as per advert"
1878,612,5," A great purchase& lovely colour pink and they are of great quality.  I must for any girly girl :-)  Would recommend :-).  With thanks :-)"
1879,612,5," Went well with both of my daughters they loved the colours keeps the kids bead boxed topped up and arrived on time :)"
1880,612,5," No problems arrived as expected."
1881,612,5," Bright colour"
1882,612,5," Good item"
1883,613,3," My three year old daughter loves this toy and I love it too because the beads and all the other items in the high quality box are not likely to choke my 1 year old son. It's also wonderful to have a set which includes example lacing sequences for my daughter to follow& a bit more of a challenge than simply lacing in any order at all.However& there's one big problem with the product I received...the box contains three sticks (a bit like knitting needles) which can be used for lacing onto something like a rod. One of the three sticks we received is too wide to fit into the hole in the stand. So it's completely useless. My daughter can only use two of the three sticks& which means that the game is over much more quickly.  Very disappointing.Amazon issued me a 20% refund& which I feel is less than we are due as the product is 33% defective.A great toy& but defective."
1884,613,5," Unlike the Melissa"
1885,614,5," Brilliant as very happy& thank you"
1886,615,5," I bought these for my 3 and a 1/4 year old daughter for Christmas.  She enjoys playing with them and they are just the right balance of challenge and ease to keep her engaged. I particularly like this set over other bead sets as they come in the handy easy to open plastic jar.  I would recommend these."
1887,616,1," ORDERED THESE AS MY DAUGHTER WANTED THEM AS THEY WERE 2 COLOURS  AS PICTURED. BUT INSTEAD I RECEIVED 2 PACKS OF 300 BANDS/ WHICH MY DAUGHTER HAS PLENTY OF &WHICH YOU CAN BUY IN MANY PLACES FOR Â£1 EACH PACK..WHEN I QUERIED THIS THE E-MAIL I RECEIVED BACK SAID THAT IT. STATES COLOUR MAY VERY. I WAS NOT HAPPY AS THE DESCRIPTION SAYS 2 COLOUR BANDS AS SHOWN IN PICTURE.  I DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE ANY STARS BUT I HAD TO GIVE 1 & AS I COULDN'T SUBMIT A REVEIW WITHOUT A STAR RATING"
1888,616,5," Really pleased with the 600 loom rubber bands and my daughter love all the colours would be ordering more soon"
1889,616,5," Friendship loom bands i purchase were great value for the money and I have one very happy little girl indeed"
1890,617,4," Liked this but was disappointed as the backing was made of shiny paper not the velvet like material these packs usually come with& so the finished picture did not look quite as nice and any wrongly placed pins left holes that then showed or had to be covered over. However my son loved it and it kept him quiet for hours."
1891,617,3," Really enjoyed doing this I have only the red to do and front wheel but I have ran out of pins so had to buy some shame really as all pins should be in with product got some for my son has he has just started his sequin art same as me"
1892,617,5," My sister in law brought her daughter one and she let my son help and he didnt want to stop. I got it for his 6th birthday and he loves it& Hes actually doing it as i write this. Brilliant fun and cant wait to frame it."
1893,617,5," bought this 4 my 7 yr old nephew he loved it completed with a little help great 4 boy who r in2 art"
1894,617,5," this very good old craft for kids to do to get them away from electronic games when they get bored"
1895,618,5," These are the largest of the Hama Beads and are excellent as a top up to a set that you may already own.  The advantage of these beads is that being larger both my three year old daughter and five year old son enjoy playing with them& since they can position them on the peg boards easier than the Midi size beads.  We've had hours of fun making designs inside on wet days and in the garden when it's been dry."
1896,618,5," These beads have been excellent for developing the fine motor skills of the younger children at our pre school. We don't iron the finished product but reuse the beads over and over again."
1897,618,5," Wanted some suitably-sized hama beads for a young grandchild of three.  When I found these on Amazon I ordered them and they came within two days.  Fast& efficient service.  Thank you."
1898,618,5," These are even better than the regular Hama beads. Great for working on pincer grasp. Fun and therapy all in one."
1899,618,5," My son loves doing maxi beads 3years"
1900,619,5," Product arrived on time and was just what we required for putting on a notice board.  A very good product."
1901,619,5," Great for displays on huge walls"
1902,620,5," A great range of colours and the paper is a good quality.  I use the paper for pastel work for which it is ideal."
1903,620,4," Although some colours weren't as bright as hoped the sheer amount if paper and array of colours was fantastic. Made some great wall displays using it."
1904,620,3," Colours rather dull for children's work and not subtle enough for adult pastel work.  The product is a near miss in both departments."
1905,621,3," I have had these stickers before but they have never been folded before& very unhappy about this as it meant I had to put heavy objects on them to try and flatten them."
1906,621,4," Good quality stickers and perfect for finishing off my scrap book. Arrived on time and I'm happy to say in a flat package so the stickers do not roll up. Only thing to say would be if using with children an adult should peel the stickers off as they can break. Good product though and well worth the money!!! Where can you get quality stickers for this price these days!!!"
1907,621,5," Loved these stickers.  Good quality and comes in nice colours.  I use them to stick down envelopes and to put on the envelopes when sending someone a birthday card."
1908,621,5," Beautiful drawings of flowers on sticker.  They are far superior to a lot of other flower stickers I have seen and bought. I shall definitely buy these again."
1909,621,5," Used this to go through a book with a child& we put stickers on the pages we'd read.  Very pretty and sparkly.  Easy to use and stick well."
1910,621,5," Received stickers well within estimated delivery times.Loads of stickers on sheet&  lovely colours too.Definitely recommend."
1911,621,5," Really good value for money --- exactly what I wanted and. Very good quality and selection -- would certainly recommend to friends."
1912,621,5," Very pretty stickers that cheer up envelopes and even as letter headers& excellent value& and a quick service."
1913,622,5," Positive reinforcement goes a long way when teaching. I find that the thought of getting a sticker at the end of a lesson really helps to encourage all of my students to work a little harder.It would nice if there were more than three types to choose from. I found myself having to buy additional stickers so there would be more variety.They arrived very quickly- thank you Amazon!"
1914,622,4," I was so impressed to find some musical stickers with appropriate rewards. Kids enjoy these and proud to take them home to show their parents."
1915,622,5," My children's choir were thrilled to be given one of these stickers& after a good rehearsal and also after an excellent performance."
1916,622,4," Got these stickers to use in my work. They are bright and cheerful and the kids love them. Wish they were sold in a bigger pack..."
1917,623,1," I was really looking forward to receiving these and when they came the cut out of the sticker didn't marry up to the picture so when I peeled the picture I had half a minion this was the case for all five strips . Very disappointed .. The delivery was very quick that's why I gave one star.. ðŸ˜•"
1918,623,1," These were stuck to the backing cardboard with glue& which meant the stickers ripped as I tried to remove them from the packaging."
1919,623,5," bought this for my local hospital outpatient clinics as they were running out and i though do some good even if a small thing"
1920,623,5," Exactly as described. Quick delivery. Happy with product Beowulf recommend and use again myself"
1921,623,5," Arrived today absolutely brilliant for what I want them for would definitely recommend them"
1922,623,5," Great value for money. Pretty stickers. All different. Nice size. Fast delivery."
1923,623,5," My little girl loved these stickers. Great quality too and very fast delivery."
1924,623,4," Good quality. Split up product for my 3 grand children' stockings. Job done."
1925,624,5," This came in the week"
1926,625,5," I purchased these items for students that were struggling with adding& the quality of the books are excellent and really easy to understand with the stickers included encourages the desire to learn."
1927,626,5," This is a birthday present for my grand-daughter and I am sure she will love it."
1928,627,5," These don't dry out easily& have sharp and clear colours and are easy to store with the provided lid. These are easy for children to use."
1929,627,4," good but it doesn't keep very long as it dried out. But I used it for all Christmas cards and to make a few canvases for the Grandparents so very useful for that.  The gold and red colours are nicer than the green"
1930,627,5," Great for baby/toddler handprints& pretty much comes off with a flannel or baby wipe and the rest easily came off in the bath!  Good colours gives nice bold prints."
1931,627,4," Great for making baby footprints. Washes off easily. Downside is lid doesn't secure so I wrapped cling film around it to preserve the ink."
1932,627,5," A very god size for small hand prints& the paint washes off very easy and it makes a lovely print with lots of paint for many prints."
1933,627,4," Very happy with paint pad& bought so that I can do handprints of my children. Have been able to recover and they are still useable"
1934,628,5," WELL I HAD TO PAINT HER HOME AN IM GLAD I DID& I CANT SAY TO MUCH ABOUT THEM& THERE THE BEST..."
1935,629,1," These do NOT glow in the dark!! You will waste an hour of your life sticking these miniature stickers on then when you go into the room in the middle of the night and you can NOT even see stickers.!! This item got one star as I have to put it to review this product. Well done seller for ripping customers off!!!!!!!!!"
1936,629,5," Quick and efficient!!"
1937,630,3," I previously bought this product for a new home banner and rated it 5* because it was awesome and didn't hesitate to buy it again for a birthday celebration but quickly realised that there is a fatal flaw in this product so am re reviewing at a 3*Product is great and looks great BUT (and it's a big BUT) there are only 2 letter Y's in the box!!!!! Eek!!!!Now& if you are going to buy a banner& I'm going to go out on a limb and say the word HAPPY is going to be in there somewhere. There goes one of your Y's. If it's a birthday then DISASTER!!! Birthday ends in a... Yep a Y!! You now have no letter Y's yet so Yvonne sorry you don't get a personalised banner& Ryan? Unfortunately you too! Emily& Jayne& and Mary - yep you guessed it - your personalised banner is doomed!!!Our celebration was for a Mandy - I tried to fashion some Y's out of left over V's (an artist I am not!) and even contemplated using an IE for comedy value but didn't want to be |that guy|. luckily we all call her Mand so I had to stick with that! But there's nothing worse than abbreviated names on a personalised gift!Hope the makers of the product read this - stop being stingy with the Y's!!!!"
1938,630,5," Plenty of colourful letters& numbers and symbols which hold together with small brass paper fasteners.  An ideal kit for simple banner making. Would recommend as a good buy"
1939,630,5," Delivered really quickly and a great item. Interchangeable letters/numbers and loads of them. Really pleased!"
1940,630,5," Easy to put together and looked ace when hung up& everyone was impressed with how artistic I appeared to be"
1941,630,5," This is great bunting have side it three times already very handy to have an easy to put together"
1942,630,5," This is so fab love the fact i can make what ever i like up on the banner& it did a perfect  job"
1943,630,5," Lovely colours and a fun way to change decor in daughter's bedroom"
1944,630,5," Brilliant& easy to assemble and perfect for my home decorations!"
1945,631,5," Excellent value for money"
1946,632,5," good"
1947,633,5," Bought to add to grand daughters Moshi collection."
1948,634,5," Just perfect."
1949,635,5," Great& bright red. The glitter sets them off and makes them a lot nicer than other candles. I would use this company again for candles like this."
1950,635,5," I used this product as a ruby anniversary candles on a cake but would be perfect for any occasion. is a great product and can be used again and again. easily lit."
1951,635,2," The wax went into black blobs as soon as they were lit andvran all down the side of the birthday cake! Very disappointed seeing as the cake was white."
1952,636,3," This card is v good quality& nice and thick.  However I've only given it 3 stars because it doesn't go through the printer v well at all.  Whilst it prints colours okay& because of its thickness the rollers have trouble gripping it so it slips which means all my designs come out completely in the wrong place (i.e. too near the edge or sometimes off the page).  I've used 300gsm hammered card before with no problems but I'm guessing this one must have some coating on it that my printer doesn't like.  Shame& because it is really good quality card.  If you're using it to fold and embellish& rather than print on& then it would be perfect."
1953,636,4," Arrived very quickly& perfect condition.  Very good price.  Only thing was that I thought it would be slightly whiter and a bil less creamy coloured.  Nevertheless& excellent service& product and price."
1954,636,5," Good quality& thick card.  Make sure your printer can cope before buying though!"
1955,636,5," Excellent quality card and a good ivory colour rather than too creamy.  I would highly recommend this to any card maker/crafter."
1956,637,5," Good quality stickers"
1957,638,5," These are so cute! I love them and so do a lot of the children in my class who want to win them.as prizes!"
1958,638,5," cute...my granddaughters will love these"
1959,639,5," I bought these for a sticker chart for my daughter& I still have over half left after the chart was complete. They are now used when we have had a good/week. Well worth the money& stick down well."
1960,639,5," Would recommend this product to others& great value& kids love stickers and there are plenty in this pack to keep everyone happy."
1961,639,4," Nice& but not enough glue"
1962,640,5," This is a stocking filler and looking through it I'm sure will be loved. It's  packed with things to do and should keep her occupied for quite a while."
1963,640,5," Was bought for someone who is monster High mad.good book with loads of different things to do which I am sure will keep them entertained for ages."
1964,640,5," Impressed with delivery - the book was delivered the day after ordering. Lots of activities and stickers with answers in the back. About 60 pages& good value. Great for our 7 year old Monster mad granddaughter."
1965,640,5," These books are so good& so many pages and really high quality. I bought 3 and my daughters love them!"
1966,640,5," Excellent item&far better than i expected&highly recommended for any monster high lover&many thanks"
1967,640,5," Bought for a birthday present for a 9 year old who absolutely loved the gift."
1968,640,5," My 5 year old daughter loves this and has nearly completed every page."
1969,640,5," Bought this for my 7yr old daughter and she loved it ."
1970,641,5," great companion to lower case letters!"
1971,642,4," This glue is the best for any decopatch or any craft product. It leaves the product glossy and stuck. It dries very fast and is great to use with any tissue paper. It is really amazing and you can really tell the difference against other glues i have used in both the process and with the finished product. Hugely recommend. This glue has lasted at least 4 months without hardening and has made many many crafts with it. The product is of very high quality and it is defiantly worth spending more for this glue than any other brand. Although just beware that it is cheaper elsewhere and you can get a lot more for 10 pounds rather than paying 7 pounds for it here."
1972,642,4," very good..does exactly what it should"
1973,642,4," exactly what it says good product"
1974,642,5," Perfect for decopatch."
1975,642,5," does the job"
1976,643,5," This ribbon is fairly good quality and I really like using it =). It arrived fine and despite me feeling like I use it all the time it has lasted me quite a while. I even bought it in another colour."
1977,644,5," I bought this kit for my 6 year old grandaughter to keep her amused when she visited us. She loved it - she painted the Pony so well and neatly with a little help - but not much - from Grandma and she was so proud of it that I bought her a little wooden easel to display it as she wanted to take it back home with her. A wonderful gift and such good value - It kept her busy for at least an hour and she thoroughly enjoyed doing it."
1978,644,4," Bought as a party bag gift after a Ceramics painting party as I wanted something different from the cheap little plastic toys. A little tricky in places but fun."
1979,644,5," I bought this for my nephew and he loved it! I'd definitely recommend the Reeves range of products& we also bought the underwater theme painting"
1980,644,5," Great little set& stocking pressie and she was thrilled"
1981,644,5," A future gift...Fast delivery and all intact."
1982,645,5," Precision cut so you have none of those white or colourless outlines.  They look good on any colour of card including black.  Ideal for card making.  The grand children love them too."
1983,646,5," Very cute!"
1984,647,5," This is fantastic. My 2 yr old loves stickers but also loves to pull them off again and gets frustrated when he cant. So this is just perfect. They're not really stickers but some sort of plastic that just works. He loves it!"
1985,648,5," Pleasantly surprised how big these are  compared to other that I have brought& these will have lots of use from the childminding children."
1986,648,5," Excellent"
1987,648,5," Great"
1988,649,5," Fab for small hands"
1989,650,5," As always& Djeco have produced a craft item that is great quality& just that little bit different and appealing to both adults and children. As a Mum I'm always delighted if my girls get a djeco present. This will be loved by my crafty niece."
1990,650,5," Bought for my 10 year old for Christmas.  We both really enjoyed making the decorations which look beautiful hanging up in her 'vintage style' bedroom.  Would recommed as very good value for money.  Can't wait to start on next Djeco project!"
1991,650,4," Bought this as a present for our granddaughter.She really enjoyed playing with it. A good buy to pass the time"
1992,650,5," Beautiful."
1993,651,5," The Woodware heat gun arrived with full instructions and was easy to use from the start. It has two settings& slow and fast& the slow setting is best for ultra thick embossing powder and general heat setting. The fast setting  heats  normal embossing powders quickly. It is a quiet and light heatgun& easy to hold with a wire table top rest. The metal nozzle is covered with an outer plastic nozzel to prevent burns.I would highly recommend this product."
1994,651,5," It is lightweight and easy to use. A benefit that I found was that it did not get too hot. Also it does not discolour the embossing powder like some other guns"
1995,651,5," Very pleased and arrived very quick Does what i wanted to do with it It is easy to use and safe if you follow the instructions Thank you ...................."
1996,651,1," I think the one I received was faulty - it wouldn't even turn on.However& I don't mind returning it - the handle seems clumsy& and the base is too large to hold by hand because of the handle. Did a lot of research for this& very disappointed. Would not recommend or purchase again."
1997,651,4," It's good qaulity and I really can't fault that. But it's like a noisy hair dryer so no good for what I want it for as it blows the shrink wrap away before shrinking it. Quick delivery though."
1998,651,5," Perfect and just what I needed will def be ordering another 1 just encase this fail's to work as need a spear to keep me going& thank you very much for this I really do love it"
1999,651,5," Item as described. First time I have used one of these. Instructions for use easy to follow and result is brilliant. Will be using for lots of items now."
2000,651,5," Good quality heat gun with two speed settings. I love that the handle folds down and I can use it in a |gun| style which is easier for me."
2001,652,5," These arrived very promptly indeed and were just as described.The are going to be used in some party games and will fit the purpose perfectly."
2002,652,5," Super item& really good size for craft activites with small children& we have used them as heads for Nativity figures and baubles."
2003,652,4," Fine exactly what i needed and arrived quickly. worth what we paid. This is what i like no nonsence. Well done"
2004,652,3," The spheres are slightly less than 25mm and some of them are damaged."
2005,652,4," what can i say foam balls as ordered"
2006,653,5," This is an excellent sketchbook for the price& the paper quality is amazing and great for anyone who uses paint& pencil& pen& charcoal& the list goes on.The front cover is made of canvas so its great for painting your own design on the front. The only downside to this is that you can't really do a detailed pencil drawing with it& which is what I was hoping to do but its still great for painting. Overall a great product and a great service from the retailer.***Its wasn't in the description when I purchased& the book contains 80 pages.***"
2007,653,5," For a student& this sketch book is great.  It allows you to decorate the front and back covers and make it your own. The paper is not the best& but it is perfectly serviceable for acrylic paints& water-colours& pastels& inks and pencil.  I have used this make four times now and can thoroughly recommend it."
2008,653,5," I brought this to practice in and it's shaping up fantastic! The paper is great for sketching and light coats of paint although I wouldn't recommend using water colours. It's got lots of pages and the ring binder is very strong. It's also great that you can customise it& lovely sketch book."
2009,653,5," Just what I expected& A4 canvas in good condition and good paper. Plenty of sheets for lots of art in the future!"
2010,653,4," This contains 80 pages of well-bound& thick& white paper. It was& at the time I bought it& the only spiral-bound sketchbook I could find with a white cover. I didn't pay much attention to the fact that the cover was a |canvas|& i.e. meant as a painting surface. The negative thing about it is that this surface has a really rough texture to touch& though I presume this is what a |canvas| is like. This being said& I bought it to use the papers& not the cover&"
2011,653,5," It's so hard to find sketchbook's for art that have any kind of personalisation on it. I had one of these years ago and I've found it so hard to find it again so I was delighted to get this for the price. The paper inside it is just slightly thinner than I would have liked but I just love the canvas so much it's perfect for charcoal& oil paints and acrylic. It also arrived really quickly& i know where i'll be getting my sketchbooks next semester."
2012,653,4," This was well worth the money. It arrived within a few days and was well protected. The paper is really nice and decent to sketch on. I haven't painted on it yet but it's quite good quality so I think it'll be fine. My only complain is the canvas cover sometimes gets stuck turning it over but that is me being picky. I don't usually leave feedback but was pleased with this product and the efficiency of the seller."
2013,653,4," lovely art pads. however they always seem to have a little black mark only pin size on each page but it can be a little annoying but still a good buy and would recommend them as i have brought three of these in total."
2014,654,5," bought these for my grandson who is mad about minecraft& he was thrilled with them and stuck them on his bedroom window straight away& will buy from again."
2015,654,4," Brilliant bought them for our sons bedroom. Just big enough for spreading around on one wall. Very good for the money. Will buy again if needed any more."
2016,654,5," Bought for party bags for 8 year olds. My son loves it. Good quality and arrived promptly. A must for Minecraft fans"
2017,654,2," Disappointed thought they would have be a bit bigger"
2018,654,3," GREAT STICKERS MY SON LOVES THDM However very pick for just 3 stickers. But still good buy."
2019,654,5," grandson liked the stickers but smaller than I thought"
2020,654,3," Not much for the price. Stickers are very good though"
2021,654,5," kids made up with these- stuck on windows- quite fun"
2022,655,5," these wooden craft dolls are fab my children love them& plus its craft they get to keep. I have brought a few diffrent ones for christmes presents  would recomend these a most by for younger girls."
2023,655,5," Superb present - educational and great fun . I got it for my 4 years old one - she loves it"
2024,655,5," Bought as gift for nursery party&very happy x"
2025,656,5," Loved them& crisp& perfect& clean& feel professional& nice crisp look to them (not cold)& worth the money!  Very happy bride to be!"
2026,657,3," Some of the shades are a bit strange& could do with a very pale colour and a very darker brown which is not actually black."
2027,657,5," Brilliant my children had fun doing these thank you !"
2028,657,5," got for multi cultural display at work very happy"
2029,657,5," These are brill the kids loved making faces"
2030,657,5," Very good resource for the preschool"
2031,657,4," got exactly what I wanted promptly"
2032,657,5," Excellent range of skin colours."
2033,657,1," Ordered by mistake. Pressed the buy button when scrolling lol. They looked ok though."

2043,661,5," fast delivery perfert for needs"
2044,661,5," happy with purchase"
2045,662,4," Beautiful. This paint pad made me feel like I had been transported to 1950's France...then I remembered it was for my four year old daughters birthday present and took the beret off! In all seriousness though: glorious colour ranging from subtle pinks to vivid neons and beautiful paintbrushes. Worth every penny"
2046,663,5," used to make communion cards for my son's class friends.Great"
2047,663,5," Love these - they really are great."
2048,664,5," This saved me drawing a dodgy looking donkey!  Numbered horns to stick on the unicorn. Kept all the princesses happy for 15mins at the party!  Arrived very swiftly too!"
2049,664,5," I ordered this for my daughter's 6th pony party. I didn't expect too much and got it out to fill some time and the kids all loved it... Range 3-8!! Was impressed with numbered unicorn horn stickers so everyone knew which was theirs!! It arrived promptly too!! Def for choice for a little time filler!!"
2050,664,5," This game was a massive hit! My little girl thoroughly enjoyed playing this traditional game with a modern twist. We had hours of fun and found that if we were careful we could take the stickers off and reuse then a few times. Superb value for money. It arrived on time and in excellent condition."
2051,664,5," The 6 year old girls enjoyed playing this game at our fairy themed house party..great find! Easy to use and very pretty"
2052,664,2," Was a little bit smaller then expected and the mask wasn't very good but the kids had five mins of fun"
2053,664,4," Ideal present for a unicorn fan and party lover!  It was a gift so havent seen it out of the packaging"
2054,664,4," This unicorn game added a little fun to our 5 year old's Unicorn Birthday Party. It's pretty simple& but also it's pretty cheap - a small poster of a unicorn& and some stickers (numbered horns) that the kids can stick on - as in 'pin the tail on the donkey'. But with a unicorn twist."
2055,664,4," This is a beautifully drawn unicorn& with stick on horns and a blindfold. will be a good game to play at a party& and woth 16 horns& so plenty to go at. I did think that the unicorn picture could have been a bit bigger& but still pleased with it though."
2056,665,5," My son loved sticking these all over the cards he made to give people.  Couldn't ask for more for the price."
2057,665,5," I bought this item for my primary school class and they love the sparkly stickers. They arrived very quickly and are great value"

2062,665,5," Nice item. Purchased for craft activities with my grandchildren. Good price and very colourful. Recommended."
2063,665,4," Lovely stickers bought to add to cards and the envelopes.  A little bit too dear but good quality."
2064,666,5," Excellent cards. Used to make Christmas cards. Did fit in the envelope after embellishing& but did not add too much. Will buy again. Nice texture."
2065,666,5," great quality and value for money. Fast delivery too!"
2066,667,5," My 6 year old loves these and are good to keep entertained! Seemed a little pricey for what it is but he loves them as much as I did when I was a child so a nice treat"
2067,667,4," Might be 5 star but haven't used this one yet with my grand daughter who is 5! Looks as if there is lots of scope for talk and she loves similar activities..."
2068,667,4," These are fab just wish there were more of them for the money."
2069,667,5," Really great little present& much loved by the recipient."
2070,668,5," Excellent present for any child who likes messing about in the garden - everything comes in a cute gardener's bag too for kids to carry round."
2071,668,5," We are trying to educate our 3 year old in a lot of different things and this is a fantastic little package that has given him real independance in the garden and an even better interest in digging!! lol"
2072,668,5," Very nice little gardening set for kids& well made with the essentials and space to add some parts if needed& you get Gloves& Trowel& Shovel and Border markers. There's space to add parts if needed but it has everything they will need to help out and get started into their gardening or allotment endeavors!"
2073,668,2," I was looking for gloves small enough for a 3/4 year old. These aren't that small& which is fair enough& but frustrating that there seems to be no indication of the size of the gloves. The tools"
2074,668,5," I bought these for my green fingered friend's children. They were delighted with them so hope they are as good quality as they look when the kids start working with them."
2075,668,5," The little boy I bought this for went straight outside and started digging. He didn't even want to come back in for his birthday cake!Enough said!"
2076,668,5," I absolutely love this and so will the little boy who I bought it for. Prompt delivery and absolutely lovely present. Really really pleased with it."
2077,668,5," The little boy I bought this for loved it. Robust& appealing to little ones and contains everything they need to help out in the garden."
2078,669,5," They seem a little small for the price but I've been assured that all the kids love them.  Just what a moshi fan wants!"
2079,670,4," I bought these to do craft work with my son and he loved sticking eyes and colouring / painting patterns on them. They are completely blank so children can design away from scratch. Also& I was happy that they were larger than I originally thought - about A5 in size (each). Good variety of animals too!"
2080,670,4," A good selection of templates& nice size for what I required though thicker would have been preferred."
2081,671,5," This pack is great. I got one for a friends little girls birthday. And it was so impressive I have now brought three more for Christmas presents."
2082,671,5," My boy loved these!"
2083,671,4," Ok. Son liked it."
2084,672,5," Very pleased thank you"
2085,673,5," Fine"
2086,674,5," They were smaller than expected& but my wife still loved them for the kids& sparkly."
2087,675,5," Excellent item just what I wanted thank you."
2088,676,5," These bullet holes look very realistic on my Chrysler P T Cruiser & I've used them to mask one or two scratches as I can't afford to have the car re sprayed! They look really good"
2089,676,5," Look great on the case of my laptop. However& one word of warning - if you do not have a SMOOTH case such as the HP these WILL NOT LAST and begin to peel.Other than that& great product as said."
2090,676,5," These are high quality stickers that give a perfect illusion of bullet holes. Don't mix them with other bullet hole stickers though."
2091,676,5," GOOD GIMMICK LOOK REALISTIC ON CAR BUMPER WOULD BUY AGAIN."
2092,676,5," What can I say the packaging says it all"
2093,677,4," Good enough! Good selection of sizes& stick well& look nice& good quality& the gold scratches off if it gets scratched but perfect for sticking on school work or reward charts."
2094,678,5," Such a lovely book and easy to do. My boys loved doing them."
2095,679,3," All seemed well at first but then my 4year old had peeled them all off within minutes and stuck them all over the house.....I'd say they are good for keyboards that young children don't have access too !"
2096,679,5," Has transformed my dull black and white keyboard into a bright and colourful one.  Some of the keys don't match up but that is probably because the computer is so dated. Still fab though!"
2097,679,5," Brilliant. I would recommend to any one buy this product."
2098,680,5," I was very pleased with all aspects of my purchase of my 1st. canvas ballerina my granddaughter will be thrilled"
2099,681,4," good value and promptly received great for arts"
2100,681,3," I was hoping for finer glitter but glitter is glitter& yknow? Fine for crafts or sending to enemies."
2101,681,5," great service and product"
2102,682,4," Nice addition to our Le Toy Van farm. Well made and stands up by itself. I've not given it 5 stars because the saddle is a bit loose and slips about."
2103,682,5," Very pleased indeed a lovely wooden toy horse very well made too ideal for my grandson he loves it to bits thanks once again"
2104,682,5," Good quality from a known brand"
2105,682,5," Granddaughter thrilled."
2106,683,5," Highly popular stickers - nearly all gone and much trweasured by those who have earnt them.  Great service& thank you."
2107,683,5," these stickers were so bright and sparkly& they were loved by my 3 year old great grand daughjter."
2108,683,3," The children at school just love these stickers"
2109,684,5," Exactly the colour shown in the photo. Very pleased."
2110,685,4," This was a great picture to paint& but thought it might be a bit difficult for a beginner. A word of advice before purchasing this& with te paints that they supply you your picture will not look anything like the picture shown on the box. I suggest you buy some different paints that are of darker shades than the supplied paints for that realistic effect."
2111,685,3," This was my first paint by numbers. It took me around 20 hours to complete and I thoroughly enjoyed myself painting it. However the finished picture was not like the picture on the box which had obviously been done by a professional artist. The actual painting did not have the same level of detail or colour. The acrylic paints even after being well stirred still allowed the numbers on the board to show through requiring two or three coats between drying to fully cover.Imo& the image on the box should be a facsimile of the finished painting and not a misrepresentation as a marketing ploy. So buyers can clearly sees what they can expect for their money.But this aside it was okay to start off with and I have since purchased other PBNs including from other producers"
2112,685,5," Excellent product& I was sceptical at first because there are some reviews that say the colours dont match the picture but i found that if blended correctly they match the picture exactly. Would highly recommend."
2113,685,5," I have just completed this painting by Reeves Night watch.I took just about 6 weeks to complete it& taking my time and when did about 2 hours at a time becouse of the fine areas so small at time one could not rush it.now it is finished and in a pictuer Frame it looks wounderfull& in fact I have done this for my son-in law but dont want him to have it really loll now.Well worth the time and effort ."
2114,685,1," I've bought two paint by numbers from the Reeves collection and they are nothing like the picture on the front. This wolf turned out like a patchwork quilt of the worst colours imaginable. They're so dissapointing and not something you would want to complete once you realise how badly matched the paints are and how misinformed you were by the picture."
2115,685,5," A terrific painting once complete& a little difficult in my opinion as I'm not the greatest but I enjoyed doing it. Delivery was very good and the price was very reasonable. I would recommend."
2116,685,4," Hard to paint especially when colours don't match the numbers but looks great when finished and I would recommend it to all animal lovers"
2117,685,5," AirBox Products are the best I have used before and I have and will continue to buy these superb painting brands of a whole range of paints& painting paper& drawing paper& Easle's& pencils& paint brushes etc.... There is plenty to choose from and as a keen Artist I have had Brilliant results from each Art piece with Quality assurance guaranteed every time. Delivery on time& well packaged and a Very Happy Customer Indeed. Thank you AirBox"
2118,686,4," I bought these for my sons reward chart but they were to big for the boxs on the chart so we used them for just making pictures. They are not really useable as the corners fold up when you pull them off but they are ok for the money."
2119,686,3," Lovely stickers& but they sent the wrong ones (twice).  First came Fireman Sam& and then another JCB set (not the ones shown).  I gave up in the end :o) but helpful customer services.  Great quality stickers though."
2120,686,5," Fantastic as a reward& potty training at the moment he loves going now to get a sticker"
2121,686,5," as expected"
2122,687,5," Loads of sheets filled with gold and silver star stickers& great quality! Doing great for us I use them on my daughters reward chart. Really recommend!"
2123,687,1," Disappointed with these as I use them as rewards with children I coach and they do not stick to their clothing. Wouldn't buy again"
2124,687,5," Great value for money& my little one feels very reward when sticking this to his homework chart."
2125,687,3," Arrived in time but a few strips of stars had a white line across them from printing."
2126,687,1," Lovely stickers brilliant value... Just don't actually stick .. Such a shame"
2127,687,5," Excellent item. Arrived on time. Very pleased. Exactly how it was described"
2128,687,5," Very easy to use. Stars peeled off easily unlike some I have bought ."
2129,687,5," They are fantastic for my daughter school work thanks"
2130,688,4," Good quality A4 craft card in 4 pastel coloursPros: Nice colours& strong enough for painting and glueing& lots of sheetsCons: Expensive but this is a good strong card& not paper"
2131,688,5," Very nice card& good quality and a very good price for the amount that you get. This card is perfect for my card making and cutting dies."
2132,688,5," Always useful to have a supply of coloured card for my crafting classes lovely pastel colours ideal for making cards thank you"
2133,688,4," The card was as I expected it to be . The colours were nice and my children enjoyed decorating them"
2134,689,5," Baker Ross materials always considerable above other companies and excellent prices."
2135,690,5," Colour is excellent.  Some places provide burgundy as more of plum colour. This is spot on."
2136,691,5," This is an outstanding image for anyone to attempt  &Painting by Numbers. .However I bought it for a dear friend who has recently suffered a Stroke &and cannot use his right hand..So although it will take him time and effort &I am sure he will struggle through and make a good job of it"
2137,691,5," I've painted about 9 or 10 of 'paint by numbers' and I must recommend this one as the best ever.  It is absolutely fantastic.  Some iv'e done and had to change colours around& but if anyone out there enjoys doing this for a hobby - this one is a MUST!!"
2138,691,5," This paint by numbers is not for the faint hearted.  It would not be for a beginner.  It is very intracut and will need a lot of patience to complete&but will be worth it. Great winter project."
2139,691,5," Birthday present for granddaughter looks fantastic finished will probably buy more for future birthdays.Also reasonably priced and very well packed."
2140,692,3," My four year old cabin boy pirate grandson was staying for the night and in the morning I left  it out and found him unusually quiet and engaged with the project. He spent over an hour humming happily to himself as he decorated both sides of the card scenes. He dressed and undressed the pirates& sent them off to the desert island& manned the pirate ship against raiders and really enjoyed the fun to be had.Later on when his cousin arrived& he proudly showed the scenes to him& then there was more fiddling and placing the figures. By lunchtime the set was exasperating& they 'res useable stickers' would not stay on& they fell off the board and generally misbehaved. What a shame.I was going to compare this set to the old fashioned fuzzy felt scenes I used to  play with& and so you'd think a modern version would be new and improved. However - this set is purely a couple of plays and in the bin& an ideal stocking filler to keep a three or four year old amused for a spell but no more.A lot of thought has gone into the art work and design& the jolly colours are really attractive and appealing& they just didn't give much thought to the sticky stuff!"
2141,692,4," This sticker set comes with a seascape scene to place a set of pirates on.  The characters are in their undergarments and layers of clothes and accessories can be added.  Then everything can be peeled off and started again.My girls both really enjoyed playing with this.  There was lots of Jake and the Neverland Pirates based make believe going on.  But the attraction eventually wore off& as did the stickiness. In fairness& the stickers are reusable but my girls placed them on fabric& so they picked up fluff and fibres and stopped working.Stickers are always popular with kids as are pirates too.  Overall it was good fun and produced some nice play."
2142,692,3," This pack contains a two-sided piece of card (roughly A3) showing a pirate ship scene and a beach scene& and a set of puffy pirate stickers plus various accoutrements - crabs& treasure& telescopes& swords etc.  You can dress the pirates and complete the picture with the other stickers.The scene cards have a |plasticky| covering so it is easy to remove and reposition the stickers.  However& there is nothing special about the adhesive and the reality is that the stickers stopped being sticky quite quickly& once they were handled by my 4 year old.After the first |go|& about 2-3 of the stickers had become unusable.  We lost quite a few more on the second go& and by the end of third outing I'd say we have about half left.It is a decent quality product but I do think that the |reusable| label suggests that the toy has more staying power than is in fact the case."
2143,692,4," My 6 year old son absolutely loved these. We go them to take on holiday for a long flight but they ended up getting used and lost well before the holiday. The stickers arrive on a sheet and can be peeled off and reused on the cardboard folding background. It has a handle but the stickers still fall off when carried. Best used on a flat surface. My only gripe is that I would have preferred an envelope or something to store the stickers in to stop them falling out when carried. Once the stickers had been used and stuck to other surfaces like the carpet they were pretty useless! But my son got so much fun out of them it was worth it. We loved it so much we got another one for my 9 year old daughter."
2144,692,3," This is a fold out card with two scenes& one on each side which are really nice. There is a good selection of stickers& which are a thin foam. The stickers stick well to each other and the card. I took ours on a car ride to amuse the children. They were happy for about 10 mins then got bored (3"
2145,692,5," Quirky stickers& easy for small kids to play with.The stickers allow for different outfits to be stuck over the men and a choice of 2 different backgrounds.Very handy to keep them amused"
2146,692,5," lOVE THIS.. BUT THE STICK IS HARD TO START WITH AND YOU NEED TO PULL THEM OFF FOR THE LITTLE ONES .. BE CAREFUL IF YOU HAVE WEAK NAILS! OH AND THEN GET YOUR CHILD OR CHILDREN TO PUT THE STICKERS ON SOMETHING OTHER THAN CLOTH OR CARPET AS THEY LOSE STICK QUICKLY BUT OTHER THAN THAT A LOVELY CREATIVE ITEM."
2147,692,5," A big sheet of stickers and a doubÂ­le sided wipe clean background means plenty of fun.As well as the old fashioned Action Transfers type pictures& it's great for short narrative work with pre-schoolers.Great fun& great educational value."
2148,693,5," Great for wall displays. Good quality."
2149,693,5," Fantastic for decorating the class."
2150,693,3," Does what it says on the tin."
2151,693,5," Great and next day delivery!"
2152,693,5," Good quality and price."
2153,694,5," bought for my husband he loved it will certainly be buyng more of schipper painting by numbersbest onne he's done"
2154,694,5," I have not completed  the painting  yet but  I have throughly  enjoyed  doing the painting  so far."
2155,694,5," I have painted this for my daughter and she loves it& i found it very easy to work with. GREAT."
2156,695,4," the paper has transformed our easle which we had previously only used for chalk and now both my boys (4 and 1) enjoy drawing on the easle. Paper quality is fine for kids drawings."
2157,695,5," Paper arrived in good time.  I wanted to use it for recording a family tree and it is perfect for the task."
2158,695,4," The children love this on their easel. We love it because they can amuse themselves for hours and control it themselves so we are not constantly looking for more paper. They can draw on it& paint on it and keep their game scores on it. Great product."
2159,695,5," From experience cheaper rolls have been a false economy as they tear in use& particularly when soaked in water paints.  This paper is good quality and as you'd expect fits the M"
2160,695,5," This paper is good& my children enjoyed using it for painting& and it never ripped when soaked with water by my 3 year old& it held and was still good. It has plenty to last a while& paper is white... not dull white."
2161,695,5," A good quality product which stands up well to the rigors of childrens play. I tape a length of  this to the coffee table top and it lasts all day"
2162,695,5," I bought the M"
2163,695,3," its thin easel paper on a roll and therein lays the problem the paper is constantly trying to fold itself back up when its cut."
2164,696,5," lovely large stickers"
2165,697,5," great product and very good service"
2166,698,5," I needed these for a request card and they were  truely nice and glittery. I made a few background cards and the little girl used the stickers herself !Even though my order got lost in the post& the seller kindly re sent another set. So Thank you from myself and my little friend in the Cancer ward."
2167,698,5," The stickers I got did not look like the ones displayed in the picture& but I was very happy with them nonetheless as they were very unicorny and glittery. Lots of pink& lots of rainbow. They've been a real hit with my friends& as well (I've been sticking them on postcards). Definitely recommend these."
2168,698,3," I ordered 5 sheets of these - received 3. Contacted seller - got 1 more. Contacted seller again - got 1 more. So I did finally get 5 sheets& but it could have been easier!The stickers are very very small but very pretty. I cut them up and used them in party bags."
2169,698,4," My 6 year old daughter was very pleased when she got them for Christmas. Overall quite pricey for the amount of stickers but i suppose you have to pay to have pretty unicorns!"
2170,698,5," These are really cute stickers& i was very happy with them and so was my 4 yr old girl who i bought them for& but& they arrived all rolled up and squashed& i felt that i may as well give them to her that day as they were not nice and flat to go in her xmas stocking (having said that&the creases certainly didn't bother her and i would still buy again.)"
2171,698,2," Arrived screws up in a little pouch. Folds bent the stickers. Not necessary as they are only a small pack could've sent them in a regular envelope. Stickers themselves fine but tear easily"
2172,698,5," Bought these for my daughter in law as she is obsessed by unicorns and am going to put them in her Xmas stocking.  Sure she will like them as they are so shiny."
2173,698,1," Cheap and nastyCould hardly get the stickers off backing without breaking...very upset child and very annoyed mum.Save your money&don't bother."
2174,699,5," I ordered this for a 5 year old to keep him out of mischief in the school holidays. There are a selection of pictures to colour and stickers are provided too. It cost a relatively small amount but provided some entertainment which is exactly what i wanted it to do."
2175,699,3," This was bought to keep my three year old entertained on a plane jounrney and definately did just that. It's small and easy to fit into a backpack and the colouring pages and stickers kept him busy and happy! A good buy for Ben 10 fans and allowed me to relax too!"
2176,699,5," Excellent stocking filler for my son who is nearly 5. He loves everything Ben 10 and this is good quality for the price& delivered one time and not bent (sent through royal mail) hopefully I will be the best mummy in the world when he opens it!!!"
2177,699,3," Well what can i say& its a Ben Ten colouring set which isnt really good value for money could have got it cheaper from the shops. The stickers ended up all over the house& but in fairness i did expect that. Buy a proper colouring book last alot longer and more value for money."
2178,699,2," Good quality and my son will be pleased with it.  However& I thought it was a bit pricey for a few pieces of paper and some bog standard colouring equipment.  Obviously in this case what you pay for is the Ben 10 brand"
2179,699,5," My son had a fantastic time colouring these pictures.. it helped him with names and colours of characters... just a shame they didnt last a bit longer! :) Though in that respect they are fantastic value for money!"
2180,699,5," Got this for my little nephew and he loved it and had lots of fun putting the stickers all over his toy boxes. Good for when you are busy and want to give the kids something to do to keep them out of mischief."
2181,699,5," i brought this for a friends children& (age 5 boys) as a little stocking filler for Christmas. i think its great and im sure it will keep my friends boys occupied for a little while."
2182,700,4," good quality. great for using to make sticker pictures. nice colours. not much more I can write as its just card."
2183,700,5," Great product for arts and crafts& not too sharp and easy to cut.  Loved the variety of colours and the price.  Recommend for all kids who love arts and crafts."
2184,700,5," This is a great idea if you are starting out  on cardmaking like i was. I needed  to experiment with colors& this mix pack was not very expensive&  not really hard type of paper"
2185,700,3," These cards were great colours but some cards were quite thin so OK for layering but werent thick enough to stand up as a card itself."
2186,700,5," These cards are great colours and sturdy to take a 2 year old's creativity. We've used it to make cards and for stickers and drawing"
2187,700,5," This has/will give me and my little boy hours of fun being creative on rainy days& well worth the money."
2188,701,5," Order was delivered very quickly and was as advertised."
2189,702,5," I was very& very pleasantly surprised with the quality here& when considering the price. These are gorgeous! They look and feel very high quality& the linen finish is fantastic& seller delivered the item promptly& and everything is completely to my satisfaction. Brilliant!"
2190,702,5," These cards and envelopes are superb quality and a great price too.  Am using them to make Wedding Invites.  The card is a lovely and textured& making them look really expensive."
2191,702,5," Very good value"
2192,703,5," Really great art kit!  My daughter really wanted this after her cousin received it for Xmas.  Unfortunately they sold out of this product at TK Maxx where her mother had bought it.  She was very excited when it arrived and she been spending hours creating new ponies.  She loves the stickers and stencils included and there are plenty of pony pages inside.  We received the sketch pad that was different to the one pictured.  We received the one with Rainbow Dash (not Pinkie Pie) on the front but that was actually the one my daughter wanted& as it had the particular stencils in that edition that she liked!  Not sure what price her cousin's mum paid for it at the store.  It may have been cheaper but it was worth paying a little more to please my MLP obsessed daughter!!"
2193,703,2," Good quality but for the price I wasn't impressed.I got this as a present for a young girl but I found that it's fairly difficult to use for her& it was more fun designing free hand instead of using the stencils provided."
2194,703,4," The pad that arrived was not as pictured. The pages inside had different designs than that shown. I'm sure my child will love it as they love creating new ponies& but I feel the pony designs were better on the pad pictured."
2195,703,2," Arrived I good time but was not pinkie pie on cover as pictured and stickers/ stencils did not look as good in this set so was not able to create main characters. Daughter was a bit disappointed when she realised this"
2196,703,5," Looks good for any my little pony fan.  bought for little girl next door& father said no more my little pony toys get something learning to do with my little pony.  Hope its a success as it looks like fun to me."
2197,703,5," Got this for my 5 yo who is MLP daft and loves drawing. It was a hit!There's so many |blank| ponies you can create your own and use the stencils and stickers to decorate."
2198,703,5," My daughter absoutly loves all this book hardly puts down lots of pages to colour and fab stancils and pens included well worth the cost"
2199,703,5," all the presents my granddaughter had for christmas and she says this is her favourite"
2200,704,5," This embossing folder is really nice& it has a lovely pattern really defined a nice size. 8 x"
2201,705,5," great but i found the same one for a Â£1 at a toy shop"
2202,705,3," kids require larger pictures than this supplies& they get very frustrated when trying to remove from book and apply to there work."
2203,705,5," Excellent value for money. My two year old gets a page of stickers at a time when she's doing her crafts and loves the variation."
2204,705,5," Another book of stickers for my two favourite little girls - they will love them and probably redecorate my lounge with them."
2205,705,5," Awesome little sticker set. Only top sheet is foil but fan to stick on letters for my son to write to his little pen pals."
2206,705,4," Lots to choose from. I used them for loot party bags. The kids love them"
2207,705,5," My 2 year old lives these stickers. Great price."
2208,705,5," this was a gift for my niece she loves it"
2209,706,5," my little girl loves anything to do with Barbie and this will keep her busy while im cooking Christmas dinner"
2210,706,5," Item as described and arrived on time. Nice gift for a little girl."
2211,706,5," Lovely book with lots of scenes and excellent value for money"
2212,707,5," Lovely sticker collection. Each page is themed so plenty of choice and good range of stickers.Great for birthday party gifts and rainy days as there are plenty of stickers so you can make some really imaginative pictures or cards. Also like the sticker collection for boys. Another great from Melissa"
2213,707,4," The stickers are rather small& difficult to detach without tearing and sometimes repetitive (even a 4 year-old gets bored with so many fairies based on 4 designs). It does not hold the attention like the others. Because I had previously bought the excellent Habitats book with plastic re-usable stickers I did not realise these were not. Will be more particular next time and pay the extra for lasting appeal."
2214,707,5," Very pleased with this sticker selection. There is literally hours of entertainment for a child into sticking. They do various themes and all of them are decent. Would buy again."
2215,707,4," decent quality stickers& plenty to choose from but some of them need to be handle carefully. its not easy for 5 and 2 year old so some end ripped but it didnt put them off."
2216,707,3," This book of stickers is not as good as some of the other Melissa and Doug books.  I bought the Habitat book and that one is better than this one."
2217,707,5," What can I say& hundreds of girlie stickers! A great range& definitely recommend them. Also have the boys version and also fab."
2218,707,5," Got this sticker set for my two year old daughter& and she loves it!! She's always asking to get these stickers out. She puts them on paper and we hang the pictures around the house. There's a great assortment of themes for the stickers& from farm animals& to princesses& to fairies. All things little girls generally love. I just bought a second set for my friend's daughter."
2219,707,5," These stickers are possibly the best i have ever purchased! They are large enough that small hands can un-peel them easily& and the variety means they appeal to little girls of all interest's. Since ordering these& I have ordered 2 more different kinds of stickers by Melissa and Doug as stocking fillers for my nephews and nieces. I'm certain I will not be disappointed!"
2220,708,4," This is very good value& just what I was looking for as my little 3 year old granddaughter loves crafts and we will have some happy hours making Christmas cards and pictures for her friends and family."
2221,708,5," Good value& I use these to put on cards and cards I put money in to go on the Christmas tree."
2222,708,5," great fun"
2223,709,5," fantastic item fantastic service"
2224,710,5," BARAGIN PRICE FULL OF ALL LITTLE ARTS AND CRAFTS"
2225,711,5," Both my grandsons loves them& they are in his bedroom and play room. i will keep getting them for them."
2226,712,5," I bought these stickers to hepl with a potty training chart for my daughter& she loves peppa and they have given her great encouragement to do well and get a sticker in reward.. brillant& lovely and bright.."
2227,712,4," Product alright but delivery was poor. Came many days after the actually time it was expected to come! But daughter loves peppa pig so worth the wait!"
2228,712,3," Not what I expected& thought there would be more stickers but such a small packet& not many at all! Ok"
2229,712,3," Hadn't realised this was just one sheet of stickers with a reward card to stick them on. Ideal for some but my daughter wants the stickers on her not a card so would have preferred more stickers and no card. Stickers are nice though."
2230,712,4," I was really looking forward to getting these stickers as bought for potty training rewards& they arrived promptly& they look great and my daughter loves them!! However am very disappointed with the number of stickers in the pack!!!!"
2231,712,5," These are very substantially made stickers& not thin paper ones& but coated.  they last for ages& sticking and restocking.  And there is a good range of reward type choices& so just what I was looking for."
2232,712,5," Stickers are perfect for any use with regards to awarding my granddaughter& she absolutely loves peppa pig. Although there are not many stickers& which I was aware of& she loves them.  They can be reused."
2233,712,3," Good quality and anything Peppa pig related is a winner in our house!! They don't stick brilliantly to clothes but on the same vein I have not found them stuck to things I wouldn't want them to spoil!"
2234,713,5," LOOKS GREAT BUT HAVE NOT PAINTED IT AS YET - BUT LOOKING FORWARDS TO TRYING - GREAT QUALITY AND WOULD RECOMMEND - BUT TRY THE REEVES ARTIST PAINTING PRODUCTS AS WELL - THEY ARE SO MUCH CHEAPER"
2235,714,3," These stickers are very basic& just a shape really which resembled a form of transport. I bought these for my 1 and a half year old to play with on our flight and he liked them and enjoyed guessing the shapes and colours. They are fine for the price."
2236,714,5," My son absolutely loves these stickers& he's only 2 so a bit young to create scenes etc but they are helping him fund his creativity!"
2237,715,4," Nice stickers& sparkly&  just what I needed& deducted one star as came folded up in the post& so several of them bent."
2238,715,5," good design& easy stick& bright colours& together with another 10 similar sets I have now one sticker / day for months to come. I ordered from the same seller and the price of shipping dropped to almost nothing / pack."
2239,715,5," Bought as a Gift/stocking filler& it is a s described and has been enjoyed :) lots of fun on little craft projects  with my 3yr old son"
2240,715,5," They're really good and the amount of stickers as you usually only get one sheet of stickers and end up paying the same amount"
2241,715,3," Nice stickers& but tainted by the fact that they were folded to fit into the envelope."
2242,716,5," vital if you need 'em.very motivating in a funsome way&in the right hands."
2243,716,5," All the kids wanted to wear the stickers"
2244,717,4," A little bit small but do the job."
2245,718,5," fantastic quality and brillian price. Bargin and free delivery. Highly recommended"
2246,719,5," Does what it is supposed to do neatly& perfectly. I am delighted with them"
2247,719,5," love love love it& excellent tool for any card maker. :-)"
2248,719,5," great - it helps a lot with my crafting"
2249,719,5," Brilliant price& arrived promptly"
2250,719,5," Great product& would buy again."
2251,720,5," Great party bag favours for my two year old's birthday party. Really good value.Would buy again if my son were to turn two again and have another farm party (I'm just adding words for the sake of it now)."
2252,720,5," these where bought for party bags for my nieces party at a farm + did not disappoint& each sticker is colourful + easy to use"
2253,720,5," good value for money."
2254,721,5," grandson very happy"
2255,722,4," I bought this Wurley back pack buddy for part of my granddaughter's 7th birthday. She loves it. I was surprised that it was bigger than I imagined& quite ezpensive for what it is& but its a 'must have' from the Moshi collection. It's very colourful and pleasing to the eye& you can see why the kids love the Moshi monsters."
2256,723,5," Jar good value for money& but too big for small hands. I decant some into yoghurt pot and son has had great fun making everything sparkle."
2257,723,5," Excellent product. Lasts forever lol. Bought to do glitter xmas gifts and still have almost a full jar left."
2258,723,5," Loads goes a long way!! Decorated the whole of a Santas grotto with it and still have over half left!!"
2259,723,5," Giant jar and fab for my ruby slippers project. Thankyou!!!"
2260,723,5," Great"
2261,724,5," My 4 year old and 6 year old loved this and spent hours and hours setting this up and 'performing' show after show.A brilliant present- like it so much that I am buying it for my friends daughter too!"
2262,724,5," Present for my niece - who loved it! Simple but a lot of fun for someone who likes to perform. Excellent value for money for a small gift for a small person."
2263,724,3," Two 7year old children really enjoyed dressing the spoons - useful toy to play with especially on wet afternoon."
2264,724,5," an easy to use toy to give your children hours of fun bought as a gift for christmas.good price too"
2265,724,5," Great fun was had by all"
2266,725,5," My daughter had an activity to do for her childcare course and had chosen to do quilling with them.  She wanted yellow papers but couldn't source them locally so we turned to Amazon and they turned up earlier than expected and she was therefore able to plan and prepare her activity before implementing it."
2267,725,5," Gyorsan megÃ©rkezett& jÃ³l csomagolt Ã©s szÃ©p szÃ­nek! KÃ¶szÃ¶nÃ¶m szÃ©pen!"
2268,725,5," Great Service and product thankyou"
2269,725,5," Good as always."
2270,726,5," Thank you for my purchase. Very happy"
2271,727,4," Arrived very quickly. Was happy with my purchase. It was my friends wee girl for Xmas.I'm sure she will have great fun."
2272,727,5," Birthday present for our Grandaughter as she loves anything to do with design&"
2273,728,5," It is the small plastic moshling as described.  It is one that my daughter needed to and she is very happy with it.  If she is happy& then I am happy."
2274,729,4," Purchased these stickers for my son's Birthday party. My son thinks they are cool so Kiddies should be happy. Better value than HMV."
2275,729,4," My son is a Minecraft fan and has these displayed in his bedroom.  He loves them and shows them off to all his friends."
2276,730,5," Bought for my 2 year old son after he was able to sit on the wing of a Red Arrows at RIAT. He loves it& it hasn't popped despite him smashing it around the house for two weeks."
2277,730,3," Bought as a joke for a friend of ours and the quality is good and product as described."
2278,730,5," Brilliant my daughter will love it"
2279,731,5," Having purchased several cheap dingys from shops selling an assortment of beach tat& that last no time at all. I was surprised that this was soo reasonably priced& but first time we inflated it I was impressed at the quality.six weeks later it is still going strong having been frequently abused by children."
2280,731,5," Fantastic buy - better quality than I expected for the price - very happy with this purchase.  Easy to inflate and deflate with a pump and packs away to a reasonable size"
2281,731,5," Good size. Excellent sturdy quality. Easy to inflate and deflate with the boston valve. This fits a single teenager or 2 x 6 year old olds sitting cross legged. It will be a bit small for an average sized adult. I was particularly impressed with the sturdy material& and that that the upper part of the boat has two inflatable sections& so if one fails& the boat is still safe."
2282,731,5," Can't belive how cheap product was and such good quality"
2283,731,5," Took a long time to arrive but worth the wait.  My grandchildren love messing about with it on the sea."
2284,731,5," Great boat."
2285,731,5," Fantastic for the price"
2286,732,5," Lovely! Bought this fun water set together with the box (the Aqualock -  616) to my 3 and 7 years old boys and they absolutely love them! Amazed by the quality& needed as much as the boys are playing. Several boats and cars are included and it is easy to assemble. The brilliance is that the sets can be connected with each other& so we have built a whole aqua world in the back of our garden. Think this will be this summer absolute hit!"
2287,732,5," played with this a lot only down fall it leaks you have to make sure it sticks on the tape before you put water in it otherwise it worth having. for the play value."
2288,733,5," Such a brilliant item. I use mine for face painting to hold water. Perfect that I can scrunch it up in my kit. Removable handle too"
2289,734,4," Purchased 2 of these. They are a good fit for my 3 year old and 6 year old. My 6 year old will get at least another years use out of it. They are nice colours and come with a bag to hold the chair when folded. The bag zips up and has a small carry handle. The bag isn't the strongest material so I expect it may rip in time. My 6 year old can carry it well& but it is a bit heavy for my 3 year old to manage. They fold open and lock in to place so cannot fold or trap any fingers while a child is using it. You have to hold a clip down to close up the chair and this can be stiff and fiddly. Comes with a drinks holder which is a little weak and one already has a small hole in- however the drinks still holds well."
2290,734,5," Great and easy cleaned"
2291,734,4," I'm sure my grand daughter will love it."
2292,735,5," Not as large as I thought it would be but suits my grandson. We got a yellow one which is just the colour he asked for!"
2293,735,5," During the recent heavy snowfalls & my kids have been busy building snowcastles in the back garden."
2294,735,3," Broke too easily"
2295,736,4," Ordered two of these for my boys age 12 and 15 from amazon. Although I asked for both colours I received both in the flame design& which has not made any difference to the tremendous amount of fun they have both had& in the 8ft pool today"
2296,736,5," My children always want a bodyboard when we go on holiday& but totally impractical to take with us and can't ever find one to buy on holiday& so I bought these instead. They are fantastic. Great price on amazon. Super small packaging& inflate easily and well and great fun to surf on in the sea. Have since bought more as gifts!"
2297,736,5," Good quality for the price. My son loved this and played happily in the pool and sea for hours& (not in UK waters tho...!) and when he wasn't using it others asked to borrow it! One of the best things to bring on holiday& it takes up very little space in the case. Would highly recommend."
2298,736,5," Product is plenty big enough for an average ten year old to extract plenty of fun out of. Arrived in incredibly quick time (next day at no extra cost) and was well packaged. Looks and feels very sturdy but& as yet& it's untested under the duress only a ten year old can exert!"
2299,736,5," The blue one arrived extremely quickly after ordering& blew it up"
2300,736,5," Bought for our children for beach/pool holiday. It was robust& maintained it's status once blown up. Handles were fixed securely and didn't tear off as on other models."
2301,736,5," We bought this on holiday.  It is essentially an inflatable Boogie Board for the pool - your child's legs hang off the rear& in the water.  I wouldnâ€™t use it in surf& personally& as it does not have the rigidity needed (and inflatables at sea are dangerous as wind can carry them away) but it was good in a pool.The plastic seems not very thick but if it lasts for 2-3 holidays then I am not doing badly.You get one repair patch in the box."
2302,736,5," Three boys under ten all had good fun on these and they survived a.week long.holiday in.Welsh streams and ponds- ie rocks!"
2303,737,5," Got this for my daughter who is 5& she loves Hello Kitty and really thought she was the |Cat that got the cream| with this Body Board down at Southerndown."
2304,738,5," This lilo is fantastic& it is sturdy and one of the the most comfortable I have owned& once pumped it seems to stay pumped for ages& even I'd I leave it in the sun all day.Also it is great that the sitting surface is white& this stops you having a shock when you sit on it after it has been out all day& the cup holder even works a treat.I expect this will be around for more than 1 summer& unlike other cheap versions I have bought in the past.Totally recommend."
2305,738,5," Bought this last year for my holiday to italy and absolutley loved it. My husband could not believe how big it was. I am making him carry it again when we go away in a few weeks and have refused to go without it. Really made my holiday."
2306,738,5," Fantastic !! Amazingly comfortable chairs& the best we have ever had for comfort and relaxing."
2307,738,5," Great quality Pool Lounger& heavy duty and comfortable. Definitly worth every penny"
2308,738,5," i'ts very very good to rest and it's very nice and a good material"
2309,738,5," Every one loves floating in the pool on this a real treat"
2310,739,4," Prompt delivery.  Item was used as a prop for a show.  Had expected item to be larger but still worked for the job."
2311,739,5," Arrived when stated & good fun item for theme parties"
2312,739,5," They were great for the play we did"
2313,739,4," good quality& done the job nicely!!"
2314,739,5," Very pleased with these items"
2315,740,5," This was bought for my grandaughter for her dance class and she loves it great value for money"
2316,740,3," cheap and cheerful... did the job and that was it"
2317,740,5," Come very fast just as it looks"
2318,740,5," excellent& my kids love them"
2319,741,5," I bought these bags as party favours for my daughter's birthday and all the girls loved it. I still see some of the girls use it in school to carry their stuff."
2320,741,5," Great bag for the price& quite strong and a nice size for an 8 year old. Very happy with purchase. Speedy delivery."
2321,741,5," I bought this for my step daughter at a good price and she is using it which is a bonus!"
2322,741,3," Nice bag good price better if it was a little bit bigger"
2323,742,3," for the price there ok& purchased for a kids water party half have fallen apart but for the price and quantity I would purchase again."
2324,742,5," Great party bag presents"
2325,743,5," Bought for my dog& she loved it and it's lasted all through the summer now packed away for next year& nice thick material& would definitely buy again."
2326,743,4," This was bought for my ducks after they destroyed their first one! It was a super size and depth. Really excellent for children. After being filled and emptied every 2 days over three months the sides seperated from the base& however& come summer I will buy a new one for the girls! Good delivery time."
2327,743,5," I bought this little paddling pool for my dogs during the heat wave! It's been perfect - and surprisingly robust!"
2328,743,3," I bought this pool as a last resort& every other pool was sold out.  It's okay but I don't expect it to last long as after one use the sides are bent& however& it lasted the weekend and with a bit of luck it may last the rest of the summer.  Don't buy this pool if you want something solid to last indefinitely."
2329,743,4," Ideal size for my two young grandchildren.  Even though the walls are quite lightweight it worked well.  It need standing on a smoothish surface"
2330,743,5," Delivered early which was great because its been hot lol. I got it for me and my 2 dogs& yep only me gets in. It's great& take it out of the packaging and it's up and ready. Will recommend to anyone to buy"
2331,743,5," I bought this item for my five dogs& they got loads of use out of it and it was fab& until the puppy decided to chew it up.sad&but great thank you"
2332,744,5," After trying every to get my  nice"
2333,744,1," no plug to empty water & so was unable to empty it to put fresh water in . it was to heavy to lift over to empty"
2334,744,5," just great for older children& ours is used by 12 year olds& lots of room. quite deep for it's size."
2335,744,5," Good fun last summer until cat decided to play with side with his claws"
2336,745,4," We had the fish boat last time that my granddaughter (aged 1 year) loved but 'he' was damaged on holiday. We thought another one would be boring and although the shark is the same size she was terrified and would not go near it!!!!!! Back in the bag for next year but would recommend this type of inflatable"
2337,745,4," Bought this toy for my grandson. He has had lots of fun with it and it was great value for money and perfect for him."
2338,745,4," My daughter loved it"
2339,745,5," Very pleased with this item. My little boy loves it. It's a very good size. I have no faults with this at all."
2340,746,5," I bought this as a gift for a friend& we're both geography students at university and anything like this will keep us occupied for a while. The only thing with it is that& when i looked at it before wrapping it up& was that i couldn't really read the names of the countries& but to be fair i probably should have had my glasses on at the time.This is a hugely entertaining gift and according to my friend is coming in pretty handy as we're only a month away from our thesis deadline.I'd definitely buy this for anyone who is into travelling or geography or who is looking for a novelty stress ball to give as a gift!"
2341,746,3," It came with a price/batch number sticker stuck to it& even though it looked like there was a chance that peeling it would remove some of the globe design graphics and myself being aware of this and taking it of very carefully and slowly& it still tore of the graphics..it is a white foam ball under the extremly thin graphics& suggest to the manufactures not to put such a sticker on it."
2342,746,1," Used once& went to pull out plug to let out water& it came off the surrounding plastic!! Couldn't believe how poorly made this pool was.Anyway& tried to get a replacement thinking it must just be a one off faulty one....Seller said they would send out a replacement& and it never arrived. Contacted them to enquire as to its whereabouts& they assured us that it was en route. It never appeared."
2343,746,5," Great sized paddling pool for little ones& big enough to join them! Needs a lot of puff to inflate. So best to get a pump as well."
2344,746,4," The paddling pool is ideal for a small garden and still big enough to cool down and have fun in.  It can be filled fairly deep.  I believe it can be used as a ball pool too.  My 9 year old daughter and her friends have had a great time in it."
2345,746,5," I can't believe what a bargain i got when i got this pool. For a little over 13 pound even my other half can lie comfortably in this and hes quite big built. Aswell as having enough room for my toddler to play around him.It's bright and colourful& exactly what we wanted for our little girls and can hold tonnes of water comfortably& although emptying the pool is another story but i guess that can be the case with any large inflatable pool.Each individual ring needs inflating separately aswell as the base so i'd say a pump is a must if only to save your lungs.All in all i am very pleased& hoping it will last for many more summers to come."
2346,746,5," Needed for stress filled child with family problems. He appreciated the globe type layour& and promised he will not play football with it...fat chance."
2347,746,4," This is great for giving your hands a bit of a work-out. Great help if like me you suffer from a touch of arthritis."
2348,747,5," This is a good size pool for a quick paddle in the hot sunshine. We bought this for our dog and she likes it."
2349,748,5," Really very good& takes a lot of water& and very flat ground sensitive& but in general have been very& very pleased with purchase."
2350,748,5," took this pool to spain with me as the poolat villa was closed this year and it done thejob brill kids had lots of fun and the fillter donegreat keeping it clean would use chlorine tabletswith it as this did help to"
2351,748,3," the swimming pool is ok& and our children have had great fun but the filter unit broke as soon as it started up and spat bolts and plastic straight into the pool. plus delivery company threw the products around with no care and attention."
2352,748,5," Excellent value for money and overall very easy to set up. Filter pump works very well and overall I am very impressed with the whole set up. Be advised that the heater really is an essential purchase to be able to provide comfortable water temps but this connects flawlessly to the whole system and I feel will be money well spent. Note that set up and filling will take several hours (3-4) at least so don't have the kids hanging around waiting whilst you do it. Be prepared to shell out for the & ground sheet& cover/solar cover& chlorine floater and cleaning kit if you want to do everything right and have crystal clear water but I think for the initial outlay for everything it really will be money well spent ......if the warm weather ever arrives."
2353,748,5," Fantastic!!!!!!!Very easy to set up& my three kids LOVE it. They are 7& 10& 11.I put a step stool at the side for my kids to get in and out of it....It arrived on time and recommend it to all my friends."
2354,748,4," No problems we used a underlay under the pool to prevent anything from damaging the bottom& it took a bit of pulling out to eliminate the creases in the bottom& it does take two people do do this but not too much effort& it did take most of a day to fill& we are thinking of buying a heater as the grandchildren thought is was very cold& it didn't stop them getting in though!"
2355,748,4," This is the best thing I have brought in a long time& my family"
2356,748,5," Set this up today. Arrived a day later than said which in a Scottish summer could mean missing summer all together! Didn't realise it was coming from Germany.Brilliant and easy to set up. Allow a good two hours to fill from a hose. Children have had the best time. Set up filter tonight& will see how it is in the morning! Best pool we've ever had."
2357,749,5," I brought this product due to all the hot weather were experiencing& and the other pool had a puncher! it was easy to order and arrived the next day& which is great service.It is a good size pool& for 3 young children to sit in and play and cool down."
2358,749,4," Delivered very quickly not had chance to use it as rained ever since buying it but the last oone was excellent after we had mastered the inflating process bottom to top I think.just the right size for little ones and for filling basically water fun for all"
2359,749,1," Is smaller that I feel photos suggest and after we had it blown up and filled two rings promptly deflated. Worth payng a bit more for a better quality product as I will have to buy another now anyway."
2360,749,5," It took me a long time to consider which pool to buy& but made the right choice with this one. It is perfect for my garden& and is  sturdy& great pattern and colours and the grandchildren love it and when the weather has been nice they have spent hours in and out of it. Would recommend to anyone who wants a pool that can last for more than a few months& and anyone with a smallish sized garden& my grandchildren are between 8 and 14 and they love it."
2361,749,4," Turned out to be a little smaller than I thought& but still had great fun in it and lasted a lot longer than I thought it would."
2362,749,5," very strong paddling pool& not had to fix repairs so fair and has been used loads so far."
2363,749,2," This pool initially blew up ok& it was used once then left in the garden under a trampoline to protect it from the elements. I tried to pump it up the following week and the bottom ring sprung a puncture. I had a pool  last year which was used endlessly. I think that this pool is VERY POOR QUALITY. I will think twice about buying from Intex again."
2364,749,5," Excellent value for money! Great size for my 1 year old to paddle in...she loves it!"
2365,750,5," Great little addition that we bought together with the Playmobil - 4859 Family Camper 2010 for my four year old daughter. She has been playing with it almost everyday since. It provides hours of fun& and you can even add water if you are feeling brave.The wading/paddling pool comes with three Playmobil people& umbrella& sunlounger& hullahoop and little parts which my daughter loves.Playmobil toys are made to a very high standard. I find it pays to shop around for good deals and this set in particular is a fab buy.5 Stars!"
2366,751,4," This really is a nice toy& my son loves it.  There are lots of different play modes and many different ways the toy can be expanded so plenty of future potential too.I would say its quite an expensive product& not exactly huge value for your money but still a very good product (typical Swedish product& similar to Brio trains in many ways).  It takes a bit of time to assemble first time out of the box so make sure you have a large 5 foot square flat area and about an hour to build it (quicker on subsequent occasions as much of the initial time is in installing rubber seals).The product is definitely worth 5 stars but the one we received was missing several components.  Amazon rapidly replaced the whole product& but the second one also had components missing."
2367,751,5," Bought for my sons 4th birthday and he just loves it.  With or without water he will still play.  Looking forward to being able to put it outside in the summer and allowing him to splash as much as he likes!  We will without doubt continue to add to the set.  Great quality& would recommend without hesitation!"
2368,751,3," My two little Grandsons age 2"
2369,751,5," The kids have not stopped playing with it. Even on bad days we got it out and they played with it in their wellies and raincoats!!! :) Definatly its money worth it!"
2370,751,4," Good. Leaks a it and clips snap easily but my grandson loves it"
2371,751,5," If you would like a quiet summer& buy one of these and pop it in the garden.  My children are kept occupied for hours every day!  This set was as a present for my brother's kids as we love ours so much.  We also took our set on holiday as they are easy to transport and put it outside our tent.  This resulted in lie-ins for a week!"
2372,751,5," my children played with this in the 80's"
2373,751,2," Wasn't sure whether it should be one or two stars.  One star says |I hate it|...but I don't hate the product& in fact I think our little fellow will love it.I hate the way it was packaged.Arrived in a box which looked like it had been repackaged (I hadn't ordered a second hand version!)& and when I opened it and took out the various pieces it seemed pretty obvious that it wasn't a) complete& b) completely new.  At least two pieces missing& though we can still make something up from the pieces that were delivered.  And forget about trying to make a little suitcase out of even two of the big pieces. But the killer was the badly photocopied& hole-punched A4 sheet that was supposed to show us how it would look when assembled.I would have returned the product but for the fact that we go on vacation tomorrow and it's a surprise or our 3 year old.  I think he'll love it& hope he'll spend hours with it.I don't know if the fault lies with Amazon or with Playlearning International& but it's pretty poor service and definitely not what I expected for the amount of money it cost.And that's why it gets the two stars."
2374,752,4," Got this for a birthing pool for my 3rd child at home which I used for a bit of the labour& good compact size for small rooms but also once cleaned out is a perfect paddling pool for my other kids great buy and I love the design."
2375,752,5," Didn't realise quite how deep this pool is - small children definitely need watching in it. Love it though& nice and bright. Had to buy a pump to blow it up& but it is so much nicer than the shallower supermarket one that I kept having to repair."
2376,752,5," I bought this for my grandson& and he loves it.  Its very colourful& and the blow-up base makes it very comfortable.  I also enjoy lying in it as the sides give good support for my back."
2377,752,3," Really great pool. The only thing I don't like is the position of the plug"
2378,752,5," Seems absolutely fine for the purpose intended but my granddaughter only visits rarely so the pool has only had one outing!"
2379,752,4," This arrived quickly and seems very sturdy - It is the first paddling pool I have found that an adult can sit in! It is also quite an attractive design. The padded bottom is an excellent idea.I am in Southern France and the pool on my residence shuts end of September but it is still hot& I can now cool off in my garden.I would have given 5 stars but it came without the promised repair patch"
2380,752,5," I am disabled and my OT was unable to find me a shower chair for me and one to be made for me was silly money so we bought this wonderful pull. We fill it up with a hose and empty it with a pump and all for less then 100Â£.I am lowered into it with my hoist and bath in it just wonderful.As for children its a great pool but Mum's and Dad need to keep an eye on little ones as the pool is deep."
2381,752,5," I live by myself with a fairly small garden. I love being out in the sunshine as long as there's water around. This pool is an ideal size for one person to sunbathe in& it's nice and deep (up to my shoulders) but also grat for the kids to play in. I have spent hours in it and feel its the best investment ever. Thanks"
2382,753,5," This pool is very strong and well made. Not the flimsy types you get. There's plenty of space as its quite large and due to the ease in deflating& very easy to store away. With kids& I look for the good quality products for safety and this one ticks all the boxes."
2383,753,5," arrived on time and it's brilliant! inflated in a couple of minutes last Friday and has been up ever since and used every day! Sturdy construction and just about the right depth. I have 2 daughters aged 4 and 1 and they both love it& especially during the recent heatwave. But it's better than that because I can lay full length in it& as can my wife and there's still room for the girls. As stated& it's excellent and it's also great value for money!"
2384,753,3," I bought this thinking it would be big and deep as shown on the picture. It's mis leading and not deep or big! Just about fit 2 adults in length ways. Disappointing."
2385,753,1," The product I'm sure is fine! But the service from amazon is diabolical. I ordered this paddling pool 3 weeks ago and it's still not even here. It wasnt cheap and I wanted it for the hot weather. Where it has taken so long I am now back to work and the nice weather has gone. Totally dissapointed and will never be ordering from amazon again!"
2386,753,3," We ordered this with all the hot weather happening& and although a quality made pool felt a little misguided by the pictures. The pictures show a whole family in the pool yet it only fits 2 children comfortably. we was a little disappointed but the children were hot and desperate for a pool so kept. Probably buy another for next year."
2387,753,5," the item was well packed&arrived on time&good value and all the family realy enjoyed it in this rather hot weather weve been having the children especially were able to play safely in and around it.-------could not understand that onwebsite it was pared up with a pool cover which was not the correct size?>what was all that about?"
2388,753,4," Bought this rectangular pool for the use of our grandchildren. This is excellent value for money and so easy to inflate and to deflate afterwards.Much better than previous ones bought. . Fully recommend this for children aged 4 to 12 years of age."
2389,753,5," I got his as our dogs broke our last pool..they have been banned from this one as we love it so much. Best pumped up with an electric pump!!!!! good thick plastic and keeps it's shape when on flat ground"
2390,754,5," This pool ticks all the boxes. Safety& ease of usage& style& price and that makes it what it is - great family fun. I was so impressed& I'm going to buy another as a gift for a friend. Thank you."
2391,754,4," Ok& it hots and we all want to cool down& so I bought this item and was swayed by the positive review. It's not a bad pool& says what it does on the tin. Its large enough for 4 adults& or about 6 children& the pump that came with it was a god send (can you imagine how red your face would be to blow a 8.5 ft pool up!)The only down side Ive found is the plug is situated on the underneath - as you can imagine this is very handy (not) when you want to empty the pool to put fresh water in to it. Hopefully the makers will rectify that problem as it is a problem and hassle. Ive been told (not by the advert) that in a pool this big you should really be using chlorine crystals to stop any wigglie's as I call them (little tiny types of worm) and chlorine strips to ensure the PH is safe. Otherwise your going to be emptying the pool every 2 days. Now I didn't know this&but if you look in a rain barrel you'll know what I mean. The other thing& it doesn't come with a cover& the one i did see had poor reviews& I tried looking for a solar one but gave up as they are so expensive but this kind of item does need a cover so I'm going to have to bite the bullet as it'll stop bugs/flies etc getting in it. So there you are. The actual pool is a great size& its fairly sturdy when you lean against it and the pump is brill.  4 stars !! would have been 5 if the additional info or cover had been included."
2392,754,5," Perfect for 3 or 4 children to play in! With the pump it went up in no time.. didn't take long to fill.Very good tough durable material& took a good battering with 6 hours continuous play with 3 children and still looks new!.Impressed with the delivery speed and packaging."
2393,754,5," Great size for the children.  Pump works a treat and they have had great fun in the recent warm wather"
2394,754,1," Shop around for products! This was an expensive item which I have found a lot cheaper elsewhere by it was too late!"
2395,754,1," Got this pool today but not what was advertised and no pump with it. Very disappointed children"
2396,754,5," This is one of the best items we have bought lately all the children have enjoyed playing in it immensly"
2397,754,5," Having purchased numerous pools over the years for my daughters they always seem to get a hole or puncture.  This is a great size and so easy to put up.  We love it.  Lovely colour and holds loads of water. x x x"
2398,755,5," We have had one of these pools for four summers now. It is a major attraction during the warm weather and popular from babies up to teenagers and a few adults have been tempted in as well. The soft& inflatable edge makes it incredibly safe and this summer my son and two of his friends spent a day running across the garden and launching themselves over the side and into the water! They couldn't have done this with a rigid sided pool. Once the kids are in bed& parents can get a look in& wallowing in a couple of large swim-rings with a G"
2399,755,5," I naively thought this was a big kids (or indeed adults) paddling pool. I was wrong. This is a serious bit of kit. In the title where it says 10ft diameter dimensions& it literally does mean 10ft diameter. Of course I know what 10ft looks like& but here's a tip& IMAGINE in your head what 10ft looks like& then in reality add about 50%. You will probably come close to the actual size of this thing. You don't imagine it being as big as it is! It is huge. I am soooo glad I didn't go for a bigger one.So Step 1: Get over the shock of the size of it& it will be useful to get confirmation& counselling& in depth discussion and opinion from your neighbour& wife& postman& anybody willing to listen...Step 2: Preparation. Although it is sold as a simple concept 'easy set'- beware this is not an ankle deep splash pool. This a small swimming pool! You will need a level garden& you will need a huge amount of old carpet to put down on said garden to protect from punctures& before you then lay your pool on top& and you will need to say a loving farewell to the grass underneath - you wont be seeing that again - within 10 days of installing& the grass is already as dead as a dead thing.Step 3: Installation. It is recommended you buy an electrical pump. |Ha!| I thought. |I don't need an electrical pump.| 100 exhausting puffs later with little to show for it and I had a rethink... actually not quite - luckily for me my free stand bicycle pump& if you unscrewed the end& fitted the nozzle perfectly (about 2.5 cm in diameter). It's only the upper ring around the top that need pumping up& I personally think that's a waste of money for a electric pump -just don't try to do it by lung power alone. Installation time could well be extended by several hours& and you could well collapse.Read more â€º"
2400,755,5," This pool's design requires that you set it up on an *absolutely* level AND smooth surface. The sheer weight of water will flatten the base lining over any (and all) small lumps"
2401,755,3," This pool is really big& it takes an age to fill up 4 hrs on hose pipe!) and you dont want this if you are on a water meter. The ring at the top is easy to puncture if you have loads of kids round. The adults enjoyed it loads in the heat wave tho. I would recomend supervision of small children in this!"
2402,755,5," I waited to review this& as I wanted to get a couple of seasons out of it and give a fair opinion.First of all& I have to say that it absolutely did not disappoint in terms of strength and quality - it is still as strong and durable as the day we bought it (we have had two seasons from it so far).I decided to purchase the Intex branded pool& as we had heard from friends that the cheaper brands just did not match up to this quality and durability-wise - I have to agree on this one!The pool comes with everything you need (pool& filter& pump& inlet and outlet hoses& fixtures and fittings& etc.) except for the pump to inflate the top ring.The electric pump can be purchased for a small price& and is well worth it.Set-up was fast and very simple! I managed to set it up alone one morning& and it took about six hours to fill (with good water pressure).I would recommend that if you do purchase this& you also purchase the easy set swimming pool cover to keep out debris (and warmth in until you are ready to use it for the day) and a groundsheet to go under the pool before you set it up& as this will help to protect the base.The filter is brilliant and very easy to connect and use& however& you do need to swish the water and bits that sink around a bit to get them up as the inlet and outlet tubes are connected quite high up. We just used a soft& clean nylon brush for this and a small long-handled fishing net to scoop bits out.I recommend that you also purchase a couple of additional pool filter liners (which are also very reasonably-priced)& as you will need this throughout the season.We did choose to chlorinate our pool water& as it will last longer and not stagnate very quickly!Read more â€º"
2403,756,5," You can certainly get some pressure on this beauty and it shoots a jet of water with great accuracy. I bought mine because my collie keeps jumping up on my fence panels and barking at the birds& I don't know why he barks at birds but a quick squirt with this and he thinks it's play time and is running up for more....The important thing is that he's not wrecking my fence panels any more and we are bonding by spending 2hrs a day chasing water jets around the garden.......all in all a great product which is proving quite sturdy and is not suffering from a lack of pressure as time goes on. I might let the kids have a go in the summer although I'll have to keep the dog indoors....."
2404,757,5," Great pool and everything worked as expected.this pool is described as age 3+ I don't agree with this I would suggest this is a pool for age 1 to 3 years as this is not built for heavy or robust use. there are several sections that need to be pumped up especially around the slide which is fixed to the pool& the only section that is detachable is the blue ball pit. I would suggest NOT pumping this up to the limit but sufficient for an average sized toddler to be able to rest/sit on the side of the pool (yellow). the flower jet and shower do work and there is a tap on the connector so you can turn it off at the pool rather than running backwards and forwards to the garden tap. the connector has a threaded section to take an adaptor (supplied) to connect to a push fit hozelock type garden hose connector (not supplied).The balls are included.overall a good buy but really meant for toddlers& our granddaughter (1) absolutely loves it and I would like to think she will get 2-3 years out of it."
2405,757,1," Lovely item& but not the best quality only had it up in my lounge to check it was ok and my little girl and her friends were playing on in once it was all up and it ripped under the slide"
2406,757,4," Really easy to blow up& did it without a pump. It's now been up for weeks and hasn't needed any more blowing. To keep it up properly it needs to be blown up fully the first time or else it will deflate. My son loves this"
2407,757,5," Very good for the price my kids love it"
2408,757,4," Kids absolutely love it! Hours of fun. Bottom is a bit thin and easily ripped so make sure dogs stay away!"
2409,757,1," Bought this product for my grandsons& as they dont visit regularly& and the |british weather didnt allow us to use straight away I used it for the first time last week. It stayed inflated all of 20 mins! I cannot contact seller or return so am left Â£35 out of pocket!"
2410,757,5," Item arrived relatively quickly and was well packaged. This pool is perfect for my daughter and is well worth the money. I wouldn't fancy blowing the main part up without a foot pump though. My daughter is nearly three and this pool i the perfect size for her."
2411,757,1," Do not buy! I bought this in April for a birthday and have just put it up due to the weather and its ripped under the slide! I can't return it now as it is passed the return date! I now have 1 very unhappy 3 year old!"
2412,758,2," This item is very flimsy the plastic bends so you can't just tip it out you have to use buckets to empty until the last bit. I would not recommend this item as it won't last!"
2413,758,5," Bought this for my dogs and they absolutely love it& they have sand in one side to dig and water in the other to paddle. They spent hours in it. Delivered on time."
2414,758,5," my girls had this shell as a sand pit and paddling pool 30 years ago and now their children are going to benefit from this one.my daughter had such happy times playing in hers that she asked if her twin daughters could have one for their 1st birthday.Delivery was amazingly fast& very well packaged too and a great price."
2415,758,5," The sand/water mussel mould looks substantial it will not be used until the better weather but our grandson 18 months fits into it with plenty of room for the sand or a little water to paddle in.  It arrived on time no hassle thank you and we will use your company again."
2416,758,5," This was very reasonably priced at just over Â£20.  My son loves it.  He has a sand table but gets fed up with it as he usually wants to mix water and sand together.  This is just so simple to fill up and use and clean up for storage over winter."
2417,758,4," Great item for the garden grandson spend lots  summer days having fun.Down side water part could have a rubber plug fit for easy release of water"
2418,758,4," Very good and big enough for my daughter to play in when we change the garage into a play area for her. Would recommend to anyone with young children"
2419,758,3," Flimsy plastic - not like the ones I remember for 15 yrs ago"
2420,759,3," This is in no way big enough for my just turned 3 year old (he got it for his 3rd birthday) I'd say more around 2 years old. The sun shade doesn't stay up either& it flops down on his head. There isn't leg holes either like I thought there would be - that turned out to be better for him though."
2421,759,5," Great for my 15 monthhold granddaughter"
2422,760,5," Wow - I really wasnt sure about this but it is great.  I have just had 2 weeks in Barbados with it and I am just about to pack it away and bring it back to the UK ready for my next holiday in the spring. Just so you know it is light and flat packed but it is round and quite wide so if you are travelling with a small 'hold all' you might not get it in.... Just something to think about it.  Apart from that it was the high light of my holiday."
2423,760,5," This was expensive but I must say I was very impressed. It was easy to blow up just using my lungs as it's just two or three chambers you inflate. It stayed inflated for the whole two weeks of our hols with two adults using it daily- sometimes nodding off in it! My only criterism would be the mesh fabric you sit on. It looks like it could tear with either heavier use or if you have boisterous children playing with it. But I think this inflatable is more suitable for an adult than child anyway. Perfect for cooling off!"
2424,760,5," Only had this for 48 hours but I already know this is one of the best Â£40 worth I've ever had. This is seriously comfortable - can quite easily see me having a few siestas on a hot sunny afternoon. Well-made& sturdy& and very well designed - especially the mesh that supports you whilst allowing water to cool you& Also& delivered in excellent time to me here in Spain by Amazon. Definitely a great buy."
2425,760,5," Spring Float Recliner& Inflatable Pool Lounger& Luxury Lilo I took this to Dubai it was fantastic & I sat on it everyday reading& it was very comfortable & it was also really good the way the netting below legs and on my back let the water in so you didn't have to keep pouring water on yourself .it felt stable not the rocking feeling on a normal float . Worth every penny !!!"
2426,760,5," We bought this in Florida but you cannot buy replacent at supermarkets we have these for 6years carrying them In our lugwge getting a bit worn now so thinking oh getting new ones expensive at the price especially in uk. Ut but value for money"
2427,760,5," I have had this for a couple of years now and used it on about 6 holidays. I have to say it is the best item I have purchased for a holiday and well worth making the room for it in my case! It is always the talk of the pool and so many people ask to try it and love it too. The best bit is you can lay back enjoying the sun& keeping cool with your feet in the water and drinking a cocktail or two as it has a drinks holder. This is a must buy item for your holiday!"
2428,760,5," This chair is great& I had people coming up to me on holiday saying how good it was and trying to strike up conversations in all sorts of languages!It even fits in our splasher pool at home so when there is no little ones about I get to float about reading my kindle!"
2429,760,5," Love this Lilo..never found one up until now that you can get on without feeling very ungainly and finding it difficult to get on and off. This is ideal and also keeps you cool as a small part of you is submerged in water"
2430,761,5," Brilliant"
2431,762,5," I run a disability swim club for kids- this jacket is great for a serve downs syndrome lad we have. HEIS HAPPY WEARING IT AND IT IS A GREAT FIT"
2432,762,5," JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR MY AUTISTIC GRANDSON I WILL BE PASSING THE INFO FOR THIS ITEM ON TO OTHER PARENTS"
2433,762,5," Excellent& probably the best on the market. We use with disabled children hence security and safety is paramount."
2434,762,5," Got for my 8 year old disabled daughter it does its job would reccommend"
2435,762,5," Looks really good for my 9 year old daughter who has dyspraxia (very mild form of cerebral palsy). Will be trying it out in Portugal very soon"
2436,763,5," Best paddling pool we've bought. Sides are a good bottom-width thick& and because it's inflatable it maintains shape regardless of who's in it and what they're doing. Like sitting on the side.Decent size too& meaning our four and five year old plus their cousin were able to enjoy time together without really getting in each other's way.The only downside to the size is that it takes some time to fill and releases a lot of water when you empty it. But that should be pretty obvious and not something that would detract from a five star score."
2437,763,5," Great pool& bigger than i thought for the money& nice and deep. Easy to inflate with a hair dryer on the cool setting. Has a drainage hole for emptying. Looks fab filled up. Well worth Â£28 and can easily fit my 3 kids 11& 9 and 5 in"
2438,763,5," Despite the recent bad weather& this pool more than paid for itself. We managed to get two full grown adults and a child in it& with plenty of room to spare.The pool is easy to inflate and to fill"
2439,763,5," Great pool for the money& easy to inflate with a hairdryer on cool setting& easy to empty with a drainage plug& nice and deep& well worth it"
2440,763,5," This is the first pool we've bought that did not leak and get thrown away after the first season.  Looks nice&  good size for up to 4 kids to play in&  up to around 8 years old.  And very cheap.  Maybe we were lucky with this one&  but highly recommended."
2441,763,5," Great size... looks like it'll be fairly robust as worry about blow up things as they often aren't!  Looking forward to it's first use as a ball pool for adults so fingers crosses it' will bring many hours of fun!"
2442,763,4," Ordered this pool in the evening& arrived within a day or two& very happy with it& and it was a lot bigger&than I expected& can easily fit three children in it at one time. All round a good pool."
2443,763,5," Plenty of room for 2 children& can fit 2 freinds in too. Easy to blow up& takes a while to fill but thats because of its size. Delivered quickly. Would buy it again& looks good quality."
2444,764,5," Do not buy any other pool cover. I have had 3 over the past 5 years and this one is perfect& it fits as it slightly bigger than the 12' pool which prevents you tearing it. Its easy to fit and the draw string is subtantial and durable unlike other versions.Highly recommended."
2445,764,5," Had an old cover before that a was pain to tie around pool this one just slips on and you pull gently on the cord and the cover is secure & and it sits nicely under the lip of pool."
2446,764,5," worked well all over the summer - had no problems and am happy with it - would buy one of these again"
2447,764,5," Although the pool itself goes on forever (it seems!) every few years the pool cover deteriorates and needs replacing. I always order the same one so I know what I'm getting but this year Intex have changed the colour of their covers to a darker shade which has the added benefit of absorbing heat on a sunny day and helping to warm the water in my pool! Double benefit!"
2448,764,4," was gutted it was dark blue. too much hassle to send back. however very pleased with 12ft cover. it cant be used as safety cover but my boy isnt as interrested in going over to pool if it has cover on& which is a great deterent. if its not on his for ever trying to fill up a bucket.would recommend"
2449,764,1," HmmmI don't get it!!!!!! loads of holes in the stupid thing supposed to help keep the heat in the pool& Intek  how the hell is that supposed to happen if you designed great top and ruin it by putting holes all around it.DONT BUY IT!!!!!Better covers on the market"
2450,764,5," excellen product& warms the pool when the cover is on so no real need of a solar cover& just as good as mine has not arrived from amazon! the cover was black not blue but thats no issue. good design and promptly arrived. easy to put on pool by one person alone."
2451,764,5," Takes 2 people to cover pool& draw string pulls cover on tight. Covered and uncovered the pool about a dozen times during the summer holidays& just ripped a bit where the draw strings pull tight. Folded it up for next year."
2452,765,4," our little lad loved this on holiday. spent hours in the pool swimming around in it!"
2453,766,5," Perfect"
2454,767,5," Purchased this as a gift for my girlfriend who had been seeking a new pal for pool days& thus Cornelius was born.This is well sized float just as advertised& sturdy quality built& it takes a while to blow up manually so a foot pump is recommended to make life easier. It's great for relaxing and spending hours by the pool."
2455,768,5," My little girl absolutely loved this& it was her first time in a larhe outdoor paddling pool& she was very nervous about getting in the water at first but being able to float around in this really helped. Love the string attached so you can keep a hold and lead it around& very good quality. I'll be buying another."
2456,768,5," this is a small dinghy great for small kids and good in a swimming pool as it is not too big& nice and bright good value and good for packing in a suitcase& I don't know how strong it is as I bought it for my grandchildren but at this price its worth buying"
2457,768,5," Brought one of thease to take on my sons first holiday he loved it. Good value for money and has lasted the pull rope comes in very handy! I would say age range from 1 to about 4 maybe 5."
2458,768,5," Just right for my two little grandsons now that we've got a larger pool. Would recommend. You don't get a choice of colour though. Just what they send you. But wasn't a problem."
2459,768,5," Bought two of these for a holiday for two youngsters to play with in the pool. The kids loved them and they lasted the whole trip. Excellent value for money"
2460,768,1," Nice little biat& however within 10 minutes 40% of the air had escaped.  You get what you pay for...but it left a very disappointed 3 year old!!"
2461,768,5," This was excellent for the price and our granddaughter loves it& filled with soft balls or as a little play bed for her and her dollies!"
2462,768,5," My children love this inflatable boat. It can only fit one small child at a time& but they have such fun rowing it around the pool."
2463,769,5," Grandson saw another child with one whilst swimming. He loves having his own and it gives him heaps of confidence in the water. Looks cute too (my grandson& not the swim ring)"
2464,770,5," Excellent value for money.Perfect size for my small garden and my one year old.Appears to be quite good quality.Arrived promptly and was well packaged.Happy Happy"
2465,770,5," Fantastic item& ideal for hot sunny days"
2466,770,5," really really great kids love this really great fun"
2467,771,5," I bought this gun for quite a cheap price& so it is most definitely worth it.  A really powerful and accurate gun which includes a twelve dart clip and this is great for nerf wars as most my other guns only hold about 6& 7& 8 bullets so I've always got more shots than anyone else in the nerf war although i don't win all the time as my dad practically never misses a shot.  It of course isn't THAT educational but it's a toy so...Powerful?  Definitely.  Accurate?  N-strike elite guns guarantee twenty metres of range and it shoots further than twenty metres but it fishtails slightly after about thirty metres but thats pretty good for a for not the biggest n-stike.  Its about sixty centimetres long but you can add on components on the end of out if you have any.  Overall a great gun.Hasbro A3698 Nerf - N-Strike Elite - Alpha trooper CS-12"
2468,771,3," Can't say I didn't enjoy the first day with this but unfortunately after this the pick up stopped working very well and chewed up half the darts as they went through. On cocking the nerf gun there was a stoppage pretty much every other time. What a shame."
2469,771,4," this is a fantastic gun. it is affordabal has fantastic ranges and looks greatdont us old darts though because they shoot badly"
2470,771,5," Great gun. Never jams& although I do check my darts regularly to make sure they are not damaged. I also put a touch of Fairy Liquid down the inside front and back edges of my magazine to lubricate it. This stops the friction dragging on the darts and causing them to not load properly into the breach of the gun. Overall excellent value."
2471,771,4," Prompt delivery. Easy to use for young kids. Good quality Nerf gun."
2472,771,1," My son was very excited to receive this however he quickly gave up when every other bullet  got jammed. It was difficult to get out of the barrel without squashing and ruining the bullet too."
2473,771,2," Missiles get stuck in the gun& and when they do come out& they just drop to the ground. Not able to remove the cartridge magazine to refill. Very disappointed - returned product."
2474,772,5," Brought this pool after buying a larger one last year which took ages to set up&this one is great&brightly coloured and quick to set up and fill. My 4 year old daughter and her friends played in it for ages and it didn't take forever to put up so no impatient girls.Would recommend something underneath just in case there is a twig or stone."
2475,772,5," great service and a great product will surely buy from you again.the children are having hours of fun in the paddling pool even i have had a paddle!"
2476,772,4," This four-ring pool is doing rather well. It takes a bit of effort to blow it up (I don'thave a pump) but when it's inflated it stays up and the children like the bright colours.As mentioned in the title& this is the pool's second summer and it's still going strong. Ihave found that when it's filled to the brim& it tends to loose its shape a little& especiallywith the hot weather making the plastic a little more pliable.  However& at 5 1/2 feetdiameter& and around two feet in height it's just the right size for my daughters (3"
2477,772,2," We have used this pool a total of three times and the green layer has popped already.  Look nice but isn't durable."
2478,772,5," I bought this paddling pool rather bizzarely in the middle of a snowy winter.  Fantastic price. seems good quality and very happy with delivery etc  I am using it at the moment as small child play pen so my very young son can roll about on the floor and not bang his head against furniture.Can't wait to use it for the one hot day in the summer too!!Takes a wee while to blow it up& but worth the effort (say 30 minutes).  Handy to have four separate rings to inflate one by one& with regular breaks."
2479,772,2," We bought this last Oct 2012 as it was the tallest pool I could find that was still a paddling pool& around 24 inches high. The rings had a diameter of around 5-5.5 inches each. Unfortunately the bottm ring suddenly inexplicably deflated and has a leak. We were using it as a ballpit for our baby and at this height he can not throw himself out. We decided to order a new one. To our annoyance we have found that & despite carrying the same product code the new pool is significantly different and inferior to the last. It hs a total height of 18 inches which is the same as the original with a deflated bottom ring! As we had simply gone to our old order to reorder it we hadn't checked any product specs - not expecting them to so markedly change!The rings are around 4 inches in diameter and the whole pool feels smaller although the diameter is only slightly less.Very annpoyed that we have wasted money on this as baby cannot use it as it is less robust and not high enough for him to stay safely inside."
2480,772,5," we bought this for my grandaughter as the type of pool we wanted was hard to find filled it with 600 balls and she has a great time in it"
2481,772,5," I ordered this pool in a hurry because the forecast was so good for my grand daughters birthday and I don't regret it. It blew up quickly with a battery pump ( I wouldn't try and blow it up with lung power!) and it holds a lot of water so even the big kids enjoyed it."
2482,773,5," Bought for the dogs to use in the hot weather. It stood up to a large GSD pup playing in it so can recommend this to any dog owners looking for something to keep their dogs cool next summer"
2483,773,5," I was a little sceptical about ordering this pool as the size given just didn't add up.It is actually 5ft.It is easy to fill and will not suffer punctures.Quite large enough for my grandsons aged 7 and 9."
2484,773,5," For the price I paid it's a fantastic kiddie pool. It's great for swimming in or even just water play. It's nice that after you're finished using it you can easily fold it away. No dealing with removing all the air or having to pump it up either."
2485,773,5," Fantastic! I love that you don't have to bother inflating it or worry about punctures. My 3 year old got this for his birthday (30th June) and it happened to be a heat wave on the same day (28 degrees) - he played in it all afternoon! It's brilliant. I used kettle bells and a watering can to hold the sides up whilst I filled it - you will need something like that - or a few people! but once it's filled it's fantastic!"
2486,773,5," Ideal for my GSDog.  He frolicked around in it all Summer long!  Also useful got bathing in the warmer months"
2487,773,4," Bought this for the dogs during the hot weather& they loved it and it's still in good condition so we can use it again next summer."
2488,773,4," Item as described. Only thing I will say is when I got this item I got it out to see how big it was and it was very hard to get back in the original form it came in its not an easy pool to roll. But this is minor and something I will learn. Other than that a great pool :-)"
2489,773,5," Per description& 5 ft wide pool and works as expected - my little ones love these pools and it's a better size than the smaller ones for the kids to splash about in.5* as I think this is great for under a tenner."
2490,774,3," Brilliant fun for all the kids& but a shame that 1/2 of them were broken!"
2491,774,5," Great fun."
2492,774,5," Perfect..."
2493,775,5," I bought this ring for my 4years old daughter & it arrived very quick but my 4yrs old could  not even put one feet in it . it says in the box for over three and on the seller's description says for age of 3-6 years . I am confident it is suitable for just under three as the ring and its hole are too small for over three !!I have to keep it because it doesn't worth to send it back .Although I kept it & the seller got in touch with me and offered me a full refund & without confirming with me they kindly refunded the item and postage fee . So & a BIG thank to seller and I am going to send it back.By the way the ring itself is lovely and very likable by your princess we have the same brand armbands and my 4yrs daughter adore them."
2494,776,4," We are over the moon with this pool - although I have to add that we bought an extra 18ft thermal cover to put on top of the ground sheet as the base seems a bit thin and we did not want any old twigs which we missed on the ground to rip the bottom.Up sides - easy to set up (30 mins max)& seems very strong once water is in it - bit wobbly when empty.Big Down side - The intake valve for the filter is at about the 42 inch point so the pool HAS to be almost full before the filter can be used& and therefore the heater - IF you have younger children and are worried that they can't stand in deep water or and don't want to fill it to the top (because you are on a water meter) then this pool is not for you.Mini down side - you really must get a solar cover to go with it& and make sure you have a plug socket near where you want it to go as the lead is quite short.If you are in a cooler climate - I strongly recommend the Intex heater to go with it."
2495,776,5," We have had this pool for a couple of weeks now after purchasing it from Amazon. Delivered very quickly in just a couple of days. Pool set up was relatively easy and took about an hour but filling the pool took a little longer 23 hours - much to my daughters' frustration! The pool temperature took only a few days to reach a very acceptable temperature(and is at present 23 degrees) so I don't think you need a heater even in our poor summer climate..We did purchase a solar thermal cover separately which is a must as it does keep the pool temp up.Overall a great pool easy to put up& great value and very well constructed. I would also recommend the 48in depth which is great as my kids like to spend a lot of time under water and you can't really do this in a shallower pool. Pump works really well and it comes with pretty much everything you need apart from the chemicals."
2496,776,5," Straight forward assembly (according to my dad!) but it did take all night and most of the next day to fill (so be warned).  Skimmer works fine and the cleaning kit is easy to use - my mum says the hoover part is brilliant.  The only thing we found difficult is that the ground has to be very flat/level& which ours isn't - but it's not a big problem and we manage to have as much fun regardless!!  I LOVE MY POOL !!"
2497,776,5," Very happy - easy to erect. Erected at beginning of June.  Pool temp has gone up to 25 degrees with a heater (which requires a high voltage extension or outdoor power) Would recommend a solar cover so as temperature does not drop to much overnight."
2498,776,5," omg we love this pool and its HUGE took me a while to figure it out but once got the first few poles in there was no stop in me ermm lot bigger than I thought and on that I had to saw some of my fence out  hahhaa kids love it the only struggle is putting the cover on you need at least 4/5 people to help you which I don't have so im now looking into getting a solar one as it just goes on top of the water I think  best pool ive ever bought too 38 hrs to fill ouchie hhaha"
2499,776,5," Making a flat base was the hardest part of setting up of the pool. The pool itself was reasonably easy to assemble with two people. We always had two extra of the connectors and all the holes lined up making the pool set up easy as long as you followed the instructions. A good buy. We have used it every day with El nino solar panels and with an intex heater to extend the useage. Lots of fun."
2500,777,4," My 4 year old son loved this inflatable& he is having swimming lessons at the moment but is still short on confidence. This helped no end in getting him in the swimming pool on holiday. He liked the red thing on the front which he thought was a horn to beep and I liked it because I could pull him around the pool.By the second week he was swimming without any aids so we left the inflatable in Portugal to retire in the sun.One small issue is that it faded fairly quickly. Recommended."
2501,777,4," We got this for our boy when he was just 2 and it's still with us almost 2 years later and it's been with us to both the swimming pools and the seaside. Maybe a little rough at the edges for delicate skin but overall a great purchase."
2502,777,5," brilliant for my chunk 14 month old! not just sure if this ones 100% ok as its not staying inflated brilliantly but should of sent it back but for using once a week I just blow it back up again before I use it which suits me! fab price too"
2503,777,5," Bought this for my daughter for her holidays. It's great and I know she will have lots of fun with it. Delivery was quick."
2504,778,5," A brilliant pool for all ages. Great for toddlers to have a splash and also for older ones to enjoy a nice cool drink and enjoy the benefits of in pool seating."
2505,778,5," Brilliant family pool - bought a hand pump from Argos to pump it up and lasted all summer. Even took it to France on holiday for two weeks! Really looking forward to next summer to get it back out again!"
2506,778,5," This pool is brilliant & it is good for toddlers too as you can just put small amount of water in it and they can sit on the&chairs it's big and hours of fun& great for older kids too &great design & I used the intex 10ft easy set pool cover on mine which covered it overnight ."
2507,778,5," this is one of the best purchases i have ever made& the pool itself is well built& the look on my kids faces was priceless"
2508,778,1," Lovely for the first week but after that the stopper refused to stay in and so we can't blow it up and it's now useless. Cue distraught children. So disappointing as this was not a cheap pool."
2509,778,5," Absolutely love this pool  the kids love it cant keep them out amazing thank you so much x if you are looking for a pool this is the one x"
2510,778,5," Very pleased by it& excellent size and easy to handle. We have two kids and a dog and all seem to have lot of fun with this pool."
2511,778,5," Excellent service and pool is excellent value for price. We are an all adult family and this is ideal for those hot lazy days lounging in the garden - may the lovely summer continue!!"
2512,779,4," this is a great product. it feels heavy when you receive them but when you put in water they sink slowly and they move under water"
2513,779,5," Swim rings arrived quickly and they have given the kids hours of fun in the pool. I have a confident swimming 9 year old who can dive and pick them up from deep end& and my less confident 5 year old is improving his swimming trying to retrieve the rings& if he cant quite manage to dive down and get it he can use his foot to hook it up. Would definitely reccomend this product& good price too."
2514,779,5," I bought these for my grandsons 3 and 5 and it has helped them learn to get to the bottom of the pool.  Great fun and highly recommended!"
2515,779,5," Brought these for my daughter& she loves and has had great in the swimming pool with them. Would definitely recommend"
2516,779,5," Simple play items for kids swimming/diving. The kids really enjoyed them and they worked well& being easy to see in the swimmiong pool. it's quite easy for adults to hold the rings by threading them on their arm - an advantage if there are several children. These toys not allowed on water slides."
2517,779,5," I purchased these rings for my 5 and 6 year old kids to try and get them to be more confident and get used  to swimming under water.Well it certainly did the trick. The kids love them (and adults too). They are quite small around 5-6| diameter however they are brightly coloured. The red and blue ones are very easy to find in the swimming pool where as the green and yellow are a little more difficult which creates endless fun for the kids to find. They can also be thrown quite far. As they land in the water they slowly sink so they also give you the chance to try and retrieve them before they reach the bottom.I would highly recommend these to others as they are a very good product and well made and create loads of fun. They are also great value for money."
2518,779,2," These were smaller than envisaged.  But they are fine& and my nephew liked the way that they looked like the Olympics rings for 2012.  Postage was as much as the price of the item which was a bit disappointing."
2519,779,4," I bought these for a recent villa holiday in Greece for my 5 and 7 year old to use in the pool.  We placed one on each step to try to encourage my 5 year old to put his face in the water.  The only slight problem& is that they don't all remain standing at the bottom of the pool and my idea was that he would be able to grab the vertical ring"
2520,780,4," 2 years ago I purchased a metal frame pool& but tried to clean it with a skooba vac in line and made some holes in the bottom mainly where the seams were.  Tried mending but didnt work so purchased the easy set pool which now sits inside the old one. Its great - had to make some new holes in old pool sides to take the hoses but works fine. The Intex pool seems of better quality than the o blue frame pool so all is well. The metal frame supportsthe inflated ring and little heads hitting the inflated ring is softer than the metal poles!!."
2521,780,1," The idea of the pool is ok but the pool is too big for the construction. The sides are weak and they go out which means there isn't much height to it. I want a refund as its rubish but amazon will no not accept even thought it hasnt been used only filled with water& I wouldnt recommend you to buy one! Get one with sides and poles its loads better!"
2522,780,5," This is such a great product& great value& exceptionally easy to set up and such fun. The grandchildren can't wait to get in everytime they come. Don't forget to also but a ground cover and a ladder as they really are essentials."
2523,781,5," Arrived quickly and my 4Year old is loving it"
2524,781,5," Excellent range and lots of fun.  Speedy delivery too."
2525,782,1," The one star review is to get your attention and has nothing to do with the functionality of this pool: it's actually great. The padded floor is a fantastic idea and the sides are good and supportive for little ones when inflated fully. My big issue here is that the second ring down& the yellow one& is absolutely plastered& all the way around& with a stupid health"
2526,782,4," Great paddling pool. My sons love playing in it. Takes a while to pump it up though but worth it in the end."
2527,782,5," A really great smaller paddling pool! My little one loves it. It is not too deep but enough to give it a bath feel. The padded bottom is brilliant. Yes& it got saftey print all over the yellow part of the pool as someone mentioned in an earlier comment& but I still find the overall impression of the pool is bright and colourful& text does not bother me. Very very pleased with this buy!"
2528,782,1," Utterly unfit for purpose. None of the valve stoppers would remain in place without minor surgery. Of the 3 rings that make up the wall of the pool one wouldn't retain air upon receipt and a second went the same way within 2 days. Ended up in the bin within a week."
2529,782,5," I brought my pool to use as ball pit for the grandkids& but will use it as paddlng pool in the summer. It's lovely having the padded bottom. I'm really pleased with it& and so reasonable."
2530,782,5," Great pool for our grandson. Especially like the inflatable base as this keeps things nice and soft.Also using it as a ball pit so fun can be had indoors and out."
2531,783,3," Gelli Baff is not bad. I got it for my 2 young children and they loved it. It turns the water into a watery goo and then you add the |goo dissolver| and it turns the goo into a coloured water. I would recomend that you were a swimming costume when using this product."
2532,783,5," I Brough as gift for my nephew  He absolutely loved it  thank you for making him a happy boy  !"
2533,784,5," Haven't used it yet but hope is good"
2534,785,5," Very pleased with the pool& however it does need some kind of algae cleaner together with the chloride tablets. I will get the pump for next year as this will help. Mine gets dirty with algae after only 3 days& nightmare to empty and try to clean the algae out. Is there such a product for this problem ??"
2535,785,1," A paper made design& don't expect to use it next summer& mine kept getting tiny holes in the inflatable top& rendering the whole thing usless and unable to hold water. Don't waste your money."
2536,785,5," when i got the pool some items were missing but amazon soon rectified this& overall a very good purchase"
2537,785,4," Whether this is a disposable product after a season or not& this brings a lot of fun for money - even more so if you buy the pool in the wet season at 2/3 off the price for the next summer. On a hot day& you can get 4 or 5 kids together having great time for two hours at any one go. Compare and contrast with going to the cinema& your pay-back is almost instant. Even better for birthday parties if they ou are lucky with the weather.Having said that& the pool requires care and maintenance so that you don't need to change the water and clean the pool every week& which is fastidious. Buy a top& to prevent bird drops& leaves& particles in suspension and insects and ensure you cover the pool straight away after each session. Get chlorine and algaecide. And invest in a pump to as a third line of defence against algae - and mosquitoes larvae.That should last for three years.Let the children enjoy."
2538,785,5," Much stronger design than the bestway pools& doesn't distort.Connected to a heater and filter we have it up from April to September. they normally last five years or so& compared to one or two with the bestway equivalent."
2539,785,1," First time of inflating this pool it deflated within ten minutes and had to inflate x5 times within the hour have now ended up buying another pool as I had brought this product earlier in the year it is no longer able to be replaced even though have only used once &.I have had easy set up  pools before with no problems &i have not over inflated this pool .Would not recommend buying an Intex pool stay clear ."
2540,785,1," I must say& I'm really disappointed with the pool. After inflating the top I started filling the pool. By the time the pool was full the top ring had deflated. Obviously a small leak somewhere. A week after the pool being filled& (but hardly used) the screw plug seam has a leak! I am losing around 4| of water a day. I will leave it now to empty itself through the leak then chuck it!"
2541,785,5," Kids and adults love it very strong material& only down side is it takes about 2 - 3 hours to fill& but well worth the wait"
2542,786,2," we've had the pool for only a matter of a couple of weeks and have had the puncture repair kit out four times.... the pool now looks less like a spaceship and more like a deflated blancmange....we chose the wrong one maybe...."
2543,786,1," Easy to blow up as doesn't require much air - the downside of this is that the sides are not particularly strong and water easily escapes whenever a child gets in or out. The base is very thin and was riddled with small holes after the first use. The sides are also pretty thin and the top developed a puncture after an hour or so. Overall we felt that it's just not tough enough as a pool for children - of any age. Item discarded and replaced with a tougher model."
2544,786,5," So glad I bought this item for my little boy.  I was surprised how big it was and the depth if it.  I have not filled it to the fill line as too deep for my son.  It seems very durable.  Just wish they could make a cover for it.  As costs a lot of money to keep emptying and filling.  I did however make my own with light weight tarpaulin from b"
2545,786,5," My children love this pool. They have had hours of fun in it. It is value for money& educational and extremely durable."
2546,786,5," I was worried by how small the package was (fearing it could not be strong enough) but it has proved amazingly robust and a huge success.  It hasn't actually been used as a paddling pool because it's not been warm enough& but a 6 year old and two 4 year olds have plunged in and out of the inflated (empty) pool (being seals& lions& monkeys)& bounced on the inflated sides& dragged it around the garden upside down over their heads and best of all& using it like a hamsters wheel& three small children can roll it on its side at some speed across the grass!  I wouldn't expect the maunfacturer's warranty to cover any of this& but for two grandparents looking after 3 energetic grandchildren for 5 days in disappointing weather& it has certainly been excellent value.  Hopefully it will be warm enough to actually put water in it next summer."
2547,786,5," I THINK THAT EVERY CHILFD SHOULD HAVE IT BECAUSE:it is cheapbigger than looksover 5 peopal can fit invery tall (no one can fall out)AND LOTS MORE"
2548,786,5," Bought this pool for the grandchildren... they loved it.. plenty of room and a good depth as well.  The plastic was good and strong on it too."
2549,786,3," This is flimsy and the grandchildren were not very pleased as they found the sidea not deep enough for them"
2550,787,5," This was a birthday present - very well received!"
2551,787,2," It doesn't last long."
2552,787,5," Gun...water... boys... summer... what more could they ask for !"
2553,788,5," Great bath toy and/or pool toy.Our 2 year old really loves to play with these sharks and fish.Fun in the tub!"
2554,788,5," My son loves them and easy to catch the fish :)Nice and soild"
2555,788,5," Brilliant& the children in my swimming lessons love them"
2556,788,5," Nice and sturdy little toy& good shopping experience"
2557,789,4," The product on it's own is good. However& we bought my son the Niagra for his birthday last year"
2558,790,5," This is the best one on amazon uk usa etc...!"
2559,791,5," helped with my little ones confidence when first learning to swim.  You can get armbands very cheap in discount shops& but at the time it was more important to me to have a design that she really loved as a reward for even getting ready for swimming.  Two valves& one at the front& one at the back.  We've used these now almost weekly for 6 months and they're still going strong."
2560,791,5," I brought these cause i didnt want just plain boring ones that the store sold& with my little princess having disney princess arm-bands it goes with her disney princess rubber ring and she loves it & easy to blow up& keep her afloat and so easy to deflate and pop in the bag"
2561,791,2," These inflate easily enough and stay inflated& however after 1st use I noticed the ink on the inside of the armbands had smudged and stained my daughters arms& doesn't improve after a couple of use's and is an absolute pain to remove without making my daughters arm red and hurt from scrubbing& needless to say these are now in the bin and I'll be purchasing another pair from a trusted retailer."
2562,791,1," Although it's to be expected when paying Â£2.19 these arm bands look and feel very cheap and packaging was poor - loose in an A4 envelope.  I'd be surprised if these were genuine... They slowly deflate with each use so probably won't be much use after several uses."
2563,791,4," Our daughter was very happy with the arm bands and they work well. However& they leave an ink mark on the arm where the ink from the safety instructions on the inside of the arm band leaches out onto the skin. Thankfully it does wash off and will reduce over time."
2564,791,5," I know you can get these in various shops for cheaper. But its the luck of the draw if you actually can find them. They are lovely and my daughter can't wait to go on holiday with them. So it was still a good buy."
2565,791,4," Bought the armbands for my two and a half year old& who like most little girls love's pink and princess. They fit well and she loves the design although i think the design could be a little brighter."
2566,791,5," Absolutely brilliant. Daughter loves them.Great seller too... One of the armbands had a hole in them& and they immediately sent a new pair out to me. Thank you!"
2567,792,5," I was looking for a pool for my great grand sons.. and found a good one with this.They loved it.seems sturdier than some."
2568,792,5," Very good value. As yet& we haven't tried it& obviously but have inflated it and it more than matched our expectations. Strong and deep& it should provide hours of pleasure for the children& weather permitting. I would suggest placing it on a waterproof mat or sheet just in case there are any sharp objects which could pierce the bottom of the pool. It comes with one spare sticky patch for just such an occurrence. I would also suggest buying an electric inflator. we have a battery one but it is not nearly powerful enough. ."
2569,792,5," Good value inflatable paddling pool - nice size for a range of ages: has been ebuoyed by a 4 and  a 9 year old child. I think it will prove well above average in durability."
2570,792,5," perfect bargain quite big would easily fity a few children for a splash around im using mine as a ball pool bought 4000 balls and still not filled up lol"

2575,794,4," My little one loves it when ever we go for swimming. its worth money so can be useful for baby up to 3 years."
2576,794,5," Brought this for my son to help him learn to swim. He loves it and his swimming has come on leaps and bounds."
2577,795,1," Thought this paddling pool looked really good& nice shade for the children and it would be if it stood up! Not only that after two uses it no longer stays blown up! It has only been on grass so unlikely to have got a puncture so soon!"
2578,795,5," Lovely pool& great size (fits quite a few little ones) and fab design to have a shade attached. And what a bargain too!For info& the shade only really balances on with little bits of velcro under each leg& but it works fine for us and is actually quite nice that you can easily pull it off if you want to."
2579,795,3," Bought this paddling pool because of the shade it was supposed to provide but was left disappointed with the product. The paddling pool itself is fine. Good size and colourful.The roof bit on the other hand is only fixed into place with small velcro pads that dont actually do the trick. I got a bit fed up with it and its now in the shed. All we are left with now is an overpriced paddling pool.Shame because in theory its a great product."
2580,795,1," This item was terrible.  The top would not stay on.  It would not inflate properly and the bottom ripped.  A complete waste of money!"
2581,795,5," My kids were very happy when they saw the pool. the sunshade is very good& i dont need to worry about the sunburns& they can be there as long as they want. you can take it of if you want. nice& colourfull pool. *****"
2582,795,1," used this about 4 times wasn't happy with it roof kept falling down to one side bined it"
2583,795,1," I didn't realise the top was not attached to the pool. With getting in and out of  the he pool the top keeps collapsing and falling off and when it's not doing that my 16 month old keeps pulling it off. It attaches to the pool with little Velcro patches."
2584,795,3," The pool is big butt the roof is not that great"
2585,796,5," I ordered 2 as a gift for someone not confident in water& they were well packaged and arrived promptly.  It would have been nice to have been able to choose the colour i wanted as i wanted pink and yellow really& rather than pink and blue& but hey& they are floats and not fashion accessories...They are a decent length so an adult could use these - which is the plan. They were cheaper than those on sale at my local pool - and they only had blue.  I am pleased with this purchase."
2586,796,5," EXCELLENT PURCHASE HELPED MY 87 YEAR OLD NEIGHBOUR TO ONCE AGAIN SWIM AND EXCERCISE AFTER STROKE AND ILL HEALTH"
2587,796,5," Just the thing for my 2 year old granddaughter she loves it. plus fast delivery it will make her learning to swim a lot easier."
2588,796,5," Best thing to teach kids to swim. My nephew is confident to swim around on his own with this under his arms. Highly recommended!"
2589,796,4," We had used one of these for swimming lessons so knew what to expect. It is a great aid to swimming and is fun too."
2590,796,3," its a nice product. I bought it for my 18 month old son. well it is suppose to float and it does that.  I took to swimming pool and my son had a nice time holding on to it and floating in water.. only downside u cannot chose the color. they send me a pink one..  so if u r color conscious& might be better of shopping where u can chose the color."
2591,796,3," Not great to be honest& but all options on Amazon seem to be similar quality. Just peeling the sticker off caused some of the foam to come off and they don't look like they'll last for long. However they do the job for my 5 and 2 year old at the moment and delivered quickly as promised."
2592,796,5," Item was purchased to support my son to learn to swim. Would highly recommend as he now feels confident to actually let go of side of pool. This is a big step for him and a step closer to learning how to swim"
2593,797,5," My 2 year old loves these and swims round quite happily with them. No problems so far and much better than the rolll up arm bands we had before!"
2594,797,3," The armbands seem quite small but are supposed to be for ages 2-6.  However they are fine for my grandaughter who is 2."
2595,797,4," nice little armbands that fit my 2yr old perfect&they stay on and dont move around like some do&very good price."
2596,798,5," Great value strong and durable. Top tip buy an electric pump to blow up or you will be there all night!! we use every day for our baby to play in and fill will plastic balls!"
2597,798,5," Fab. Doesn't come with anything to help blow it up so I had to blow it myself which took a good half hour. But once up very good..padded bottom every good. Reccomend x"
2598,798,4," I purchased this before the summer for our twins for use in the garden (Around 8 months old at the time). We had a great time with the pool and filled with warm water on sunny days keeping it a little in the shade.The main reason I chose THIS pool was for the cushioned inflatable base which supports the babies when crawling and splashing around& which is why I think it has a slightly higher price point.I just deflated it last week and hope it will be put to good use again next year.PROS-- Cushioned base- Durable- Fun design- Good size for babies under 12 monthsCONS -- Not big enough for adults to sit with children"
2599,798,5," Great size for babies and children and even big enough for me to get in too!My 5 year old loves it.Inflatable floor is a brilliant feature.Recommended purchase!"
2600,798,5," Balcony friendly heatwave booster. Stopped my baby melting so love this. Her 6|7 Dad took a dip to cool off to and it didn't burst so extra points there..."
2601,798,5," Great size& easy to fill snd empty on your own. My grandson is 3 and loves it.! Inflatable floor great as added safety when on slabs."
2602,798,5," This pool is lovely& Great value for money& The inflatable base makes it great if you have to place pool on hard floor such as patio. Does take a lot of air to inflate for a small pool& so i would recommend an Electric pump. Good quality too! Very pleased with purchase. Many thanks. :-)"
2603,798,4," Perfect for one or two kids& bit small for four. I would upgrade to the larger pool by the same maker& I was happy with the quality of the Intex pool. Never bought one this summer as it was a wash out& fingers crossed for a hot summer when I can buy a big pool."
2604,799,3," The product arrived with 3 air holes in need of repair and they can be really hard to find. We decided to send it back but the we thought lets fix it. Kids all like it but this a product that in my opinion you get what you pay for. When we found and repaired the holes the kids had fun.It is a great pool and fun."
2605,799,5," Very sturdy.  Quite big& ample room for several kids to play in together.  Took ages to inflate& so we have kept it blown up all summer.  The combination of a slide and the spray feature make it more interesting for little ones to enjoy."
2606,799,4," Takes a long time to inflate/deflate but my son loves it!"
2607,799,5," Bought 2 of these one for my grandson. He absolutely loved it and had hours of fun in it. Roll on next summer."
2608,799,5," Lovely play centre. My two grandsons love it &lots of fun and nice size"
2609,799,3," Great product& great size and build quality and delivery service great. Lost two stars due to the inflatable holes& well not actually having any holes!!!! Had to carefully use a sharp knife to make the jokes in each of about 6-7 inflssnle plug parts! Precision work considering one wrong slip and the entire pool would be useless. The pump would not inflate unless I made the holes. Could have returned and exchanged the pool but more hassle I did not need! However once I was able to inflate it& relatively straight forward and durable from what I can tell so far"
2610,800,5," My son loves this. Buy a pump to blow it up though"
2611,801,5," I bought 2 of these jackets for 3 and 7 year old non swimmers. We were staying at a villa with a pool on the patio and I was so worried about the safety of it before we went. I knew me or my husband would have to be with the children at all times& but from previous experience I knew how quickly a child can sink to the bottom if they fall in by mistake without armbands on. We had a rule that no-one go outside even just to play without wearing the jacket& and because the kids loved the jackets& enforcing it wasn't a problem. No-one did fall in& but the jackets helped them to play in the pool with confidence and meant that whoever was watching them could actually read a book or look at the view without fear of that split second accident. I've never written a review for a product before& but I'd highly recommend these for giving peace of mind& as well as being an aid to learning to swim. Worth every penny."
2612,801,3," I have had to return the jacket and ask for a larger size. The 2year old fits size 3/4 and I have requested 6/7 for the 4 year old"
2613,801,5," I bought this product for my Grandson who is trying to learn to swim he finds this so much easier than arm bands as it gives him so much more movement in his arms he is doing great& I also bought smaller sizes for grand daighters as they dont swim& although we still have to watch them we have the added bonus that they will now float and be seen& with this product the removable floats means that as they get more confidence you can remove them in pairs as instructed and they will get less bouyancy from the jacket as they get better swimmers.Steve Reynolds HULL UK"
2614,801,5," my grandchildren are now safe and sound in the swimming pool.the jacket has given them confidence to trust the water and have fun . The delivery was fast and efficient . I highly recommend this product to anyone who has toddlers.at the moment they wear it with arm bands as they are only just 2years old. They swim quite happily by the side of me. also they jump in from the side of the pool and surface immediately. thank god for the konfidence float jacket. p.s don't be tempted to buy one too big &a good snug fit is better.."
2615,801,5," Excellent product.Well worth the price. Fits very well as it clings to the childs body being made of wetsuit material.  My daughter age 4 has learning difficulties and this jacket has given her the confidence she needed to enjoy the water - with a little help from us of course! Not clinging like glue as in previous trips to the swimming pool. Purchased one for my younger daughter of 21 mths at the same time and she loves it too! The only comment I would make is that for a 4 year old child without learning difficulties it would probably be quite easy to undo the zip as the velcro on top fastener doesn't prevent this much. For my needs it definately gets five stars."
2616,801,5," Brilliant - he'll now swim in just the vest. I bought the 6-7yrs jacket while he was 3 1/2 yrs old but he was in age 4-5/5-6 tops as he's always been big for his age so these do come up small."
2617,801,5," A brilliant little jacket. My 3 and a half year old has gained so much confidence with this on. I agree with other sizing comments. Got her a 4-5year jacket which is a lovely fit. Recommend this jacket& and it's worth paying a little more as the quality is great."
2618,801,5," The child has to move their arms and legs otherwise they flip on their back& or front! But after a few goes& my 2-3yr old figured it out. She wants to swim by her self like a big girl. Great compared to clinging on to us for dear life!"
2619,802,5," Got this swim ring for my Toy Story mad son to take on hols. Its so cute. Cant wait to see him in the water. Service was the best!Fastest delivery ever! Thank you very much& very happy with my purchase!"
2620,802,5," This swim ring is great for your little Toy Story Mad swimmers.  Its a great ring for a great price and my son loves his!!!!"
2621,802,5," Brilliant - This gets my friends son straight in the water as he is Toy Story Crazy.He is aged two"
2622,802,3," It is good& not as robust as the Zoggs Kids Kids series which I bought as well."
2623,803,4," This was bought for my son when he was 9 years old and these jackets are excellent as a buoyancy aid and gave him the confidence to stay in the water all the time. Unfortunately he hasn't fully got the concept of swimming."
2624,804,3," Brilliant fun for all the kids& but a shame that 1/2 of them were broken!"
2625,804,5," Excellent product. We had a fantastic water fight which did end up with a few casualties ie six of the pistols but they were being used quite enthusiastically by twelve year olds so I was actually amazed so many lasted. Much better than supersoakers and much more fun.Would definitely recommend."
2626,804,5," I haven't used them yet but they look like they should do the job... just need the sunshine to test them out!  I used them as party bag gifts and the children were thrilled to receive them"
2627,804,5," Great value for money& would recommend"
2628,804,5," Cheap and so didn't stand up to five year old boys very long& but what does and did the job for summer party play / party bags"
2629,805,5," When I couldn't get a pool anywhere else& Amazon came up trumps. Delivered in just a couple of days so we still had time to enjoy the heatwave with it. And absolute bargain! 2/3's the price of a similiar sized plain pool. The 3d effects and glasses are a great added extras. Thick walls and the ring stayed inflated for the whole of the summer holidays despite plenty of play from my 3 kids. They all played in it together comfortably. Cannot recommend highly enough. Was sorry to put it away and cant wait to bring it out again next year :)"
2630,806,5," really strong and hard wearing last all holiday even wearing them every day"
2631,807,2," Pump is too poor to suck up water from a bucket& it probably needs to be submerged in a pool to work.  No instructions at all!"
2632,807,5," My granddaughter is 8 years old she loves this& and so do I& great value and fun."
2633,807,5," Absolutely great ! Better than expected.  Arrived on time& in all very pleased"
2634,807,5," Simple to use and quite powerful. Very fair price."
2635,808,5," Used this as part of decorations for a hall hosting a beach party& very effective& hung from the ceiling& looked very good"
2636,808,5," Great for a pool"
2637,809,5," my daughter loves these and they hold her up well in the pool she is 20 months old and fit perfect x"
2638,809,5," My daughter loves wearing these. They were easy to inflate and very good value."
2639,809,1," Poor quality and look nothing like the picture and no daisy just Minnie Mouse and are a dull pink not bright pink very disappointed was looking forward to receiving the ones in the picture"
2640,809,5," Brilliant. My little girl loves them. They fit nicely and have good valves. We swim for usually over two hours at a time and they stay up all the way through. Very pleased with them"
2641,809,5," Great little armbands& good size for my 2 year old"
2642,809,4," My daughter definitely stayed afloat& she totally likes Minnie Mouse. All is well in the world of flotation devices here."
2643,809,4," If your little girl loves to watch Minnie Mouse & she will love these armbands ! These are a bit hard to find & less popular than the Peppa pig ones but I have seen these a few times . Just make shure you put her in her shoes and she is safe . They sell these in 3 sizes for 1-9 year olds including 1-3 years & 4-6 years and 7-9 years . Make shure when wearing these she is no deeper than 1.5 metres !!!"
2644,809,5," Very happy with my purchase my 2 year old loves Minnie mouse so can't wait to put them on- result!"
2645,810,5," ideal for a small baby"
2646,810,5," Great little pool perfect for either a paddling pool in the summer or a ball pool in the house."
2647,811,5," I bought this for my little ones first birthday party. He is Mickey mad and as soon as it was blown up he loved it and wanted to play with it. It even squeaks quietly when squeeze. Great colours and great size. The face is printed on and doesn't look as good as the picture. However I have attached a photo below and it's great overall. If it breaks I will definitely be buying another one. It's made of the same material as a swimming pool ball& hope this helps."
2648,811,1," Quick delivery& packaged in just a brown envelope and when I blew it up it went down with in 5 mins. Was in the bin before having it an hour."
2649,811,1," the advert looks like you would receive a inflatable mickey character however it was in fact a inflatable hammer& it was supposed to be for my little boys party and i was very disappointed when a hammer arrived instead of a character.I have emailed the seller however he has not bothered to reply.this advert is very mis leading!!!"
2650,811,1," didn't like it wasn't what I thought it would be and it wouldn't stay blown up so it went in the bin"
2651,811,4," Bought it as a christmas present for my nephew& He's mickey mouse on the brain so I am sure he will love it. Apon reading reviews on here I blew it up and let it for a day....seems to still be fully/ mostly inflated so will be suitable& And is about as durable looking as any inflatable and at its price that won't bother me when it gets busted which I am sure it will with a 3 year old/"
2652,811,5," Very easy to blow up without a pump& good size and very durable& mickey has been carted ro the shops park and everywhere he is allowed and is still going strong with no signs if wear at all& very pleased thank you!"
2653,811,5," Every1 loves mickey! He's cheap he's cheerful"
2654,811,1," Absoulty furious it's a hammer not a character mickey mouse total rip offs how dare they was for my sons party livid!"
2655,812,5," Purchased as a present for a very active little boy& this is a great paddling pool and looks like it is one that really will stand test of time. The inflatable base is brilliant for small children and adults! Nice to have something a little more comfortable to sit on.The wall panels are both attractive and very sturdy. Nice to have a pool that won't spill water everywhere each time a child launches themselves out of the pool on their stomach! As someone who hates soggy lawns or wet slippery patios thanks to pools sloshing water everywhere& this feature is really important to me. The shape is not just a nice alternative design feature. It seems to add some decent structure to the pool and holds the shape well despite very rough play when there are 4 children jumping in and out.Thanks to relatively cool weather& this pool has been used as a ball pit so far and the sides are high enough that this option also works well. While there is not a canopy like many& don't let that put you off. Slides and swings don't have canopies either! Just position it in the shade or with an umberella. I have had collapsing canopy pools and ones with roofs and they are a hassle to keep inflated properly as well as dry out and stop mould. Never again!All in all& worth the extra money. I know you can purchase a pool at a fraction of the cost - and I have done so many times. However& this is not your average |dispose after a half season| pool. Made of nice thick plastic& this should last a lot longer than one season - more environmentally friendly option and should even save money in the long term.In fact& I think I will order a second one for my own children."
2656,812,5," Deep enough for adult to sit in and easy to inflate.  Took a few minutes to inflate using our breath.  Very quick to deflate with large stoppers removed."
2657,812,5," Strong& easy to inflate and good design.Needed an electric pump tho!Seems like it will last also& so seems to be good value."
2658,812,5," this pool is excellent value i got it for Â£19& it looks expensive! it is very colourful"
2659,812,5," A good sized medium pool& doesn't take an age to fill but plenty deep enough for my 8 year old to happily play in& seems to be very sturdy with very rigorous play& very quick to put up and down& one of the best pools I've used and I've been through lots of pools with my son who plays in them for hours! The inflatable bottom is great as well and makes it really nice to sit in. I got 2 adults and a child in it easily. Will definitely get another one if needed."
2660,812,5," A large deep pool which was easily inflated with an electric pump. The base is an inflated cushion making it comfortable on a hard lawn. Our grandchildren (6"
2661,812,5," This pool took a while to blow up even with an electric pump that we had to hand.  I have to admit it isnt the pump that you can purchase for pumping up paddling pools& but once it was done it was great.  As we have the paddling pool on our patio the inflated bottom is ideal and the grandchildren loved it."
2662,812,4," I blew the pool up twice using lung power...you can do it but it does take a while....half an hour or more.  Good size pool.  We wanted one with an inflated base so it could be used as a plunge pool at the bottom of a slide...did the job.  Quite pricey but quality seems good."
2663,813,5," Beware of poor imitations that lack glide ... this thing glides underwater for ages. Great for kids and adults. Highly recommended."
2664,813,5," This on really is great fun - with a little practice& it really will fly far. If thrown just above the surface& it can start by surface skipping around 5 meters. Under water the powered throw will probably be less& but its weight allows it to still go quite far& and in any case it ends in a gliding sink which extends the reach depending on the depth of the pool. This also mean that you have to either be really quick& or dive after it (which the kids love too)On the other hand& the fact that it does sink& may mean that this toy is less suited for the beach. And less suited for kids who won't/can't dive (unless in a very shallow pool)."
2665,813,5," Great item to take to the pool and on holiday. Gave us all hours of fun. A good toy regardless of age - I've bought 3 now& one for my 4 year old& one for my 11 year old nephew and for my 8 year old nephew (us adults enjoyed playing with it too!)."
2666,813,5," This was a great interactive toy with my 8 year old son.  We devised a game which involved launching it along the surface of the pool waiting 5 seconds and then trying to get it before it sunk to the bottom (|detonated!|). Once caught you had to get it to the side of the pool and then you needed to get below the surface to stop it activating it's |motion trigger|.  The points system was based on how long you stayed under after recovering it to the side. 1 point for 10 seconds& 2 points for 20 etc...Was great fun.  Enjoy."
2667,813,5," I bought this for my 5 year old granddaughter who loves it!. it goes really well and she loves chasing it under water.It has been a great success with her swim group at the local pool."
2668,813,4," New design not as good as old one. I'm a swimming teacher& an I use Toyedo alot for building water confidence with kids and just having great fun. I lost my older Toypedo and replaced it with this new one. But have found it doesn't seem to glide as far or travel as fast as the older one. Plus when its finished gliding it seems to hang in the water before sinking which is good for less able swimmers but not as challenging for more able swimmer. Still a good design an has some plus. Will use it but now looking to purchase older model so have options to use with different ability swimmers."
2669,813,5," everyone on holidays wanted to know where you could get one...the kids absolutely loved it....definately worth the money...a must for holidays"
2670,813,5," This is the 2nd one that I have been asked to buy for my grandson age 9yrs. Great fun to play with& while swimming& and very durable."
2671,814,5," Bought in Dec 2010. A great sleigh. Seems strong but is very light.  Kids have been able to pull each other along with no difficulty on the flat. (aged 8&11&14).  Great on hills. Excellent pruchase.  Now it just needs to snow again next year.  Super fast delivery.  Got here within a couple of days despite Christmas post and snow.  Had not expected to get it till after Christmas.  Don't think we got a choice of colour but I may be wrong on that as it was 6 months ago now."
2672,814,5," I ordered this sledge on Monday and it arrived on Wednesday!!Great product and great service to match."
2673,815,5," I bought this to take on holiday to blow up a fairly large inflatable boat for my teenage sons. I deliberately went for the smaller size pump as it is very small and lightweight& ideal when you only have a 15kg weight limit each. It is easy to use and the boys were able to inflate the boat before they got bored of pumping (which doesn't normally take very long). Would certainly recommend it."
2674,815,4," This pump is good value& easy to use and inflates things quickly.  It took just three minutes for me to pump up a single airbed& with very little effort& and I am in my 70's.  It is also a neat smallish size so takes up very little room to store away.  Would recommend."
2675,815,5," brilliant product &looks and feels lightweight but certainly did the job& and I might addwith very little effort& ( I am 70yr old female &)I would definately recommend this product.and company&great service & many thanks"
2676,815,5," I'm going to try and write this with as little smutty innuendo as I can! But this hand pump really is great& makes light work of your pumping needs and is small yet powerful. Pump my single airbed mattress is less than 5 min. Cheap and light to carry& I'd recommend it. Although I am wondering how long the pipe will last...as it seems a bit flimsy."
2677,815,5," No longer is my right arm bigger than my left.This came with me to a festival this year as got fed up with naff battery powered pumps that worked about as well as an asthmatic gerbil. A large double air bed went up in 10 minutes with some fairly vigorous pumping and it was small enough to stuff in my bad :)"
2678,815,3," The adapters were the wrong size but that was my fault for not checking& however with a litle thinking i was able to use them by making a hole in a milk carton screw on top and shoving one of the pointed adapters into it.Bobs your uncle problem solved and air bed inflated.The pump works a treat now."
2679,815,5," Excellent product easy to use and sturdy used for pumping a double airbed in very reasonable time. When is situation equally easy to top up without messing around with noisy electric car pump."
2680,815,5," only needed another pump because old one did not have right connecter for new airbed. It proved not only cheap but brilliant& never had bed up so quick& hope it lasts forever."
2681,816,5," FANTASTIC ITEM! Nice weight to it& and quite realistic. Unsure which caps to use with it but i am going to try single shot caps? Failing that i will try paper strip caps..."
2682,816,5," It so realistic and much bigger. It has a long barrel so it doesn't look fake and it is heavy and the plastic is more of a metal I highly recommend it. The thing that lights the fuse does pull back so it's really fun to use!!!!ðŸ˜Ž"
2683,816,5," Good quality prop& but slightly on the small side for an adult. Note that you can use fun snaps as oversized caps for this by putting them in the pan when the hammer is pulled back."
2684,816,5," Top quality item feels like the real thing it has weight to it& highly recommend for authentic look"
2685,816,5," Lovely piece& bought for my son who had previously had a Disney Pirates of the Caribbean one but had lost it& couldn't find a replacement anywhere. This one was just the ticket he loves it. Good quality& looks good and very reasonable price."
2686,816,5," This pistol looks amazing& probably half size but boy does it look authentic. Made of metal and it feels really nice. I would recommend this to anyone!"
2687,816,5," Great pistols for pirate re-enactment festivals. The 'wood' effect is very realistic and the barrel length is perfect."
2688,816,5," Could do with being a little bigger& but for the money an excellent addition to the pirate costume."
2689,817,5," Another addition to our well loved waterplay set."
2690,818,5," Bought one as gift for classroom wet playtime toy& saw how good it was and bought 2 more as presents. Well built wooden not plasticky&all seems proper just miniature."
2691,818,5," Excellent for a 7yr old - lots of fun AND learning to play with other people. would certainly buy again."
2692,818,4," The pool table is good and I am enjoying playing with it. The size is well enough to play anywhere."
2693,818,5," Got this for my 2 year old Grandson. Good value for money and he loves it. Has it out every time he is across at gran's. At the age my Grandson is must be supervised at all times. Or the pool table would be in bit's...."
2694,819,5," Geat fun for the whole family"
2695,820,5," Wish I had bought an electric pump though as it took nearly 3 hours in the baking sun to pump up with a single cyclinder plunger style bike pump.Worth the effort though. Feels stable.Great size& four grown adults sitting& one in each corner and a toddler running about& fit comfortably with room to spash. Excellent for one grown adult to lounge about and sunbathe in.Also might be worth getting a cover and a chlorine pod as it takes quite a while to empty via the small hole& and is massively too heavy to flip when full. The inflated rings deflate quickly when the bungs are removed. Also if you put too much pressure on the sides - say& by tring to flip it and folding it instead - then the armband style fill caps pop open and release some pressure very slowly and quietly."
2696,820,4," this seems to be a reaaly good quility product& very quick dispatch. love it. however if you dont hve an electric pump as we didnt& it take quite alot of time and willpower to pump it up. end result is worth it though"
2697,820,5," The look on our children's faces was priceless& it's large enough for two adults"
2698,820,5," This pool is super easy to set up - just a couple of minutes to blow up with an electric pump& and it takes us about an hour to fill up as our water pressure is not great.  We had a larger inflatable pool last year (10ft)& but after a few weeks we could not be bothered with the filter and it contained so much water it was a real chore to empty it. This pool is a perfect size for a couple of adults to sit in/kids to splash about in& and you can easily drain the water out& let the air out and pack it away until the next warm weekend.  It feels really sturdy when up& holds its shape nicely& and you can comfortably sit against the walls.  I love the way the outer sides are clear so when the sun shines through it all you see is the cool lime green interior of the pool. It is great value and great fun and I would really recommend it!"
2699,820,5," Best pool ever so my 5 year old granddaughter said&shes had endless fun with her little friends all summer inthis pool. Good price and a very quick delivery wouldrecommend this pool."
2700,820,5," Great size just what you need to cool off in the summer& we love it. Well made& use a foot pump to get it blown up and we empty it every few days give it a wipe round and your good to go again."
2701,820,5," Bought this pool for my two young children who are five and three. As soon as the pool was inflated they couldn't wait to get in it.The only downside to this purchase is that we now have a back garden full of the neighbours children too."
2702,820,5," Fast delivery fab colour& & you do need an electric pump we are using ours as a playpen for our living room so cant comment on how it holds water & but really really pleased with this product :)"
2703,821,5," This is a great& sturdy pool.It inflates in three separate sections& so if you have a little one& you can choose not to inflate the top section so that they can get in and out more easily.  Inflates in about 1 minute per section with a decent electric pump and has plugs to stop the air escaping straight after you unplug the pump.It has a drainage hole in the bottom of the pool so that when you come to empty it you can just pull the plug out and let it drain rather than having to scoop the water out or tip it up - which would be impossible considering its weight when filled with water.We have a water meter and estimate that it costs us around Â£1 to fill it pool as we never fully fill it anyway.  The size that they state for the dimensions are the outside of the pool.  MY boyfriend is over 6ft tall though& and he can lie down in it fully with his arms out so it has a substantial inner size.As suggestions - we also bought the INTEX cover from a different amazon seller.  It fits easily over the pool.  I was a little worried that it would have no overhang as they state that the cover is the same size as the pool but this is not the case.  This will save us having to empty and re-fill it every time we want to use it.Also& we'd recommend that you put something under the pool (an old piece of carpet& a large flat cardboard box etc&) as the |floor| of the pool is just a thin film so you do feel any bumps underneath it.Overall& really happy with this purchase and the seller was very helpful."
2704,821,3," The sellers are superb but the dimensions are taken for the outside of the pool and as it is very thick you don't get as much space as you would expect from a 10 foot pool. It is quite deep on a positive note though."
2705,821,5," Really easy to blow up and perfect size for 7 and 5 year old."
2706,821,5," Lovely size pool& my kids have lots of summer fun in it."
2707,822,5," Fun& fab and sturdy.  Bigger than I thought.  My 3 year old grandson loves it."
2708,823,5," Worked as expected fun toy  the 1st couple of times shooting it may be a bit hard but after 20 times its perfect"
2709,823,4," Came as described& but like the original only comes with eight disks when it's max capacity is ten disks. The primer can also be a little stiff."
2710,823,5," fast"
2711,823,5," top notch for modders at Â£10"
2712,824,5," Excellent product. Daughter wore them all day every day on holiday and loved them. Although they're recommended from age 3& my daughter is 2 and they were perfect."
2713,824,5," My 2.5Yr adores the armbands. Although the instructions say 3-6 year old& it is good to fit any 2yrs old if you inflate them fully (always inflate them fully once they are on the arms).Inflatable on both sides of each armband& which allows you to nicely regulate the amount of air providing the level of support the little one need.Great value for the money. Very good quality of the picture."
2714,824,5," hard to review these really& but for the price they are very good& they float which is quite useful for arm bands and the fit and stay on my 4 yo arms which again is a bonus! the design is sickly awful but she likes it and wouldnt have the HR Geiger ones i wanted to get her....."
2715,824,5," Great swim bands.  My 2 year old loves them and they work as they should.  Only downfall is the colours are not as bright as I thought but if my little girl loves them then that's all that matters"
2716,825,5," My niece lovely them"
2717,826,4," My 9 year old daughter loves pink dresses& pigtails& puppies& kittens& makeup and... Nerf guns.  She loves shooting things& (tranquilising stuffed animals to take to the pretend vets& balloons& Nerf target& her Dad)& and now has several Rebelle (girly Nerf) toys.  This one is probably the most fun.  The magazine holds 12 Nerf darts (supplied) and they can be fired off one at a time whenever you want& or very quickly almost like a machine gun.  It's easy to reload the magazine too.  Be warned though& it needs four AA batteries& but they seem to be lasting quite well so far.The main unit feels quite sturdy but I imagine that the dart magazine could be easily cracked / broken if you're not carefull.  For this reason I wouldn't recommend spending Â£20+ on it.  Shop around for a lower price."
2718,826,5," For my grandchildren this is the third Neuf Rebelle product after the â€˜Heartbreakerâ€™ and â€˜Agentâ€™ bows& and it takes the form of a gun that shoots darts.  It is â€˜motorizedâ€™ and requires 4 AA batteries (not included) to supply â€˜blastingâ€™ power for its 12 darts with 6 plain and 6 with coded messages that all fit into the girly pink magazine.  There is a decoder that is somewhat gimmicky but a sliding panel on the packaging shows how messages may be read (some foreign!).  Forget this - it is fire-power that matters and the â€˜Neuf Rebelle Rapid Blasterâ€™ has it in spades!  It is more powerful than previous bows with a range up to 20 yards or so& and with enough â€˜wellieâ€™ to knock over light unfixed targets.  The gun sights well and it can shoot singularly as for a sniper or it can shoot speedily like a machine gun - so what else?  As a granddad I donâ€™t really understand the popularity of the Neuf products marketed for girls - but I acknowledge this â€˜Neuf Rebelle Rapid Blasterâ€™ as a 5-star product."
2719,826,4," Now this is a present for my niece& but I had to try it out :)It requires 4 AA batteries (not included) so make sure you have them ready for us.You load the |darts| into the magazine& and then there are 2 triggers to pull. The first in the handle you pull to activate the power& and then you have the main trigger to fire the darts. The gun does make a whirring noise when you pull the power trigger& but don't worry about it as it isn't too distracting and holding the power trigger is easy.The darts do fly a good distance and they are pretty accurate& I set up some empty coke tins to test this out. They are nice and soft& so while they do fly well and hit the target& you will not have worry about injuries. The design of the gun is quite nice as well& not too pink but still having that essence that it is designed for girls instead of boys.Only negative is the weight and the fact it uses 4 batteries in the nose of the gun which makes it slightly nose heavy& but not sure how you get around that. I think my niece will really like it."
2720,826,5," Great Nerf& design is aimed at the girls rather than the boys& lilac and purple which are a nice combination.The Nerf itself works brilliantly& shots fly across the room at some speed& and there is no excuse for not knowing who just got you as the darts are also a pink and blue.Easy to load and light weight make it a very nice weapon to carry& a lot of thought has gone in to Nerf& made for a target audience that is sure to love the colour and size."
2721,826,4," It's a nerf gun& in pink& designed for girls. It fires out single shots from a 12 bullet clip. Takes 4 AA batteries. The secret message gimmick is just that& a gimmick& and pretty pointless. No real special features otherwise to make this anything other than a bog standard nerf gun& except that it's pink!! My daughter loves it!"
2722,826,2," Bought Xmas 2014. We had bought several other Nerf guns and water pistols before& all had a reasonable build quality and all had worked well so I had no hesitation to buy this one. Unfortunately& the one which I had received was not of a great quality. The first bullet in the magazine is not presented correctly in the breech& every time you change the magazine you need to lift the breech cover and fumble around trying to push the bullet into the correct position. Even if you get it firing& there is a high probability of blockage after 3 or 4 shots. Some shots do not fire correctly and just fall out of the end of the gun.Also the breech cover needs to be closed correctly for the gun to fire. Unfortunately& it doesn't close correctly. A male adult hand is big enough to hold the gun and push down the breech cover at the same time - an eight year old girl's hand is not big enough.When you do manage to get it to fire correctly& it is pretty accurate though.It requires 4 x AA batteries. Rechargeables have a voltage of 1.2 V& whereas the ordinary& one use batteries provide 1.5V. It doesn't seem to work well on rechargeables."
2723,826,5," My 9yo daughter loves nerf rebelle and can't wait to take this to her cousins house for a full on war (cousins have several 'boys' nerf guns). I agree with the other reviewers that the secret message gimmick is pointless& as mentioned it would be better for the other team to read them& not the 'sender'. Having said that it does exactly what it's meant to do& which is fire the darts in quick succession and pretty accurately. All in all a great fun for a great price (currently on offer at Â£12.50 on here). I've just ordered a second for my little niece so she can even the score with her older brothers!"
2724,827,1," Unfortunately my son who's three had this on& fitted perfectly got in the water and sunk. The worst few seconds of my life&  ruined our holiday as he wouldn't go near the water again and now has a fear. I bought two one for my 4 year old& who also didn't float. The lifeguard actually took them from us."
2725,827,5," I was so pleased with this jacket when it arrived - I brought it for my grandson who I was taking swimming for the 1st time.  He felt safe and really enjoyed our time in the water by the end of a 2hr session he was confidently making his own way round the pool and reaching out for the pool toys etc.  All in all a very good buy.  Service from the supplier very efficient."
2726,827,4," bought this one with removable foam inserts to replace one that doesn't and rides up around his neck& this is better but still doesn't always stay round his middle"
2727,827,5," Great Product. Delievered on time. Would use again."
2728,828,4," WHAT A GODSEND. AFTER SEARCING THE COUNTY FOR SOMETHING SUBSTANTIAL TO ACCOMPANY AN ADULT WITH LEARNING DIFFICULTIES"
2729,828,5," I am nearly sixty and determined to learn before my next Birthday. These armbands have given me so much confidence and I am really enjoying my time in the water& something I never expected to say. People looked at me strangely to begin with but then all started asking me how was I doing! The armbands more than support my weight (9.5stone) and never give me cause to fret about sinking! I recommend them to any other non-swimmer adult."
2730,828,5," My husband is disabled& his legs don't work properly& he panicked in the pool and so lost his confidence. To the extent he refused to go in at all. On a recent holiday I persuaded him to try these armbands (bought without his knowledge) and he reluctantly found they were just the job. After a while his confidence came back and he managed to swim widths without them. We are both delighted."
2731,828,5," Ive been looking for some armbands for my mum whose 62 and these have been fantastic& they have helped her so much to gain confidence in the pool& extremely suitable for older people.  would definitely recommend."
2732,828,5," These armbands are very good and supported my weight & no problem & as an adult learner very handy!! As I was terrified of going under the water whilst learning"
2733,828,5," Absolutely brilliant! I've been searching everywhere for a long time trying to get swimming arm bands for my daughter who has special needs. I bought the BEMA Armbands because of the size 12yrs to adult. They are made of good quality materials and will last for many years to come. I was a little dubious thinking 'would they really fit an adult?' But I was wrong& they fit my arms and I'm 45! Will definitely recommend to my friends"
2734,828,5," These armbands are brilliant for teaching small children who are very nervous& as well as adults"
2735,828,5," This has been an absolute dream to use for my wife who is learning to swim in her 40s."
2736,829,5," Best for younger ones under 6 as my daughter is seven and couldn't ride it. It's still great fun and brilliant quality for the price."
2737,830,5," Fabulous fun with this& we have an above ground pool which was difficult for the older generation to get into so got this for them and it fit the bill perfectly. They were able to enjoy the heat whilst staying cool. Easy to clean& fold and take anywhere. Would recommend an electric pump to go with it."
2738,831,4," This was bought for my son when he was 9 years old and these jackets are excellent as a buoyancy aid and gave him the confidence to stay in the water all the time. Unfortunately he hasn't fully got the concept of swimming."
2739,832,5," We took this on holiday as there was a water park on site and the kids loved it.  I was expecting it to pop at some point but we bought it home with us ready for next years holiday."
2740,832,5," Good quality and big enough for an adult"
2741,832,4," Very good but not that intresting"
2742,832,1," This item arrived on time but failed to inflate as valve was faulty! Would not recommend this product."
2743,832,5," great size and had lots of fun with it on holiday."
2744,832,5," Excellent ring& kids loved it on holiday."
2745,833,4," Bought for stopping the cat taking over the kitchen work surfaces for her forensic ornithology studies& it's gentle and effective with a surprisingly good range.  Very useful!"
2746,833,4," I bought this to distract our two dogs when their play gets a bit noisy or boisterous in the house. A quick squirt or two does stop them in their tracks. The gun is good and squirts a good stream of water for quite a distance. Sadly I removed one point as it has seeped water out of the end of the nozzle onto sofa covers a couple of times. (Having said that& it is far more reliable than a cheap toy version) It is a good size so would be great for fancy dress too!"
2747,833,4," As a water gun its fine but if your getting it like i did for alcohol i'd not recommend it& as to shoot a shot you'd have to shoot about 30 times."
2748,833,5," Fantastic purchase just what I needed and a great low price too"
2749,833,5," Great thanks"
2750,834,5," AquaPlay is great if you've got a garden& however large or small. It keeps the kids occupied& especially since they love playing with water. I bought these to go with the AquaPlay 660."
2751,834,1," Would be nice& but the weird bears topple over and fall out& which is very frustrating to a toddler"
2752,834,5," Bought to go with Aqua play they provide hours of fun.  A great buy and so is the Aqua play set."
2753,834,5," great buy& grandsons loved them"
2754,834,5," My son loves them x"
2755,835,5," What a great item good looking great realistic weight what every Pirate needs great for fancy dress party or just having some Pirate fun buy with confidence"
2756,835,4," Just got this product and it looks good and it has a decent weight to it but already noticing that some of the screws are a bit loose tried to tighten a bit to no effect would be a good prop and it is fun to play about with too not sure I would buy it again but if its a cheap in price prop you want or a good toy gun buy this"
2757,835,4," Pretty realistic& we used for a school show and although the moving parts broke from over exuberant 'firing' it looked the part. I wouldn't think it would last long as a toy but as a prop it was spot on."
2758,836,5," Apart from some minor gripes& it's absolutely perfect and my nephew loved it to bits. If you've got the space& it's a really excellent toy.Assembly is a little difficult& and really I don't think a child could put it together very readily. It took three adults half an hour to assemble it out of the box and there was a lot of humming and hawing and |Am I doing this right?| moments. The joints don't really click together& and you often have to brute force things. Despite this& nothing broke& and the joints were all watertight (although my nephew quickly managed to splash water everywhere. No real surprises there). Once assembled it was sturdy and we were able to move it with no bother.The other wee problem was the boats that come with it& which I think are just kind of naff. Some of them aren't watertight& so wind up filling up with water& making them totally useless. In general they're just a bit too big and fat. The canals themselves are massive& and you could scoot decent sized boat toys around them no problem& but the ones that come with it are just a little unwieldy. Not holding this against it& though& because it's easy to get- or make- other boats to put into it. What you're buying here is the canals& and they're beyond reproach.I looked through a few Big Waterplay sets before finding this one& and it seems to be the only one with a lock/pump/slide mechanism. This is the best part- allowing your child to raise boats up with the pump& then send them down the slide on a torrent of water. It's great fun and a very cool mechanical lesson too. I was a little dubious as to whether it would all work at first& but it works a charm. The pump& the watertight gates and the lock all work.Read more â€º"
2759,836,5," Great value& good quality. 3 different layouts are possible.  No probs with leaks&  Obviously gets bit splashy.  Great fun re the process of getting the boats moving ( or blocked if you decide one boat is a villain's!) and lots of scope for imaginative play.  Small kids from around 2 would get a big kick out of it and plenty of pleasure to be gained from it I'm guessing for up to 9 or 10 if bigger siblings.  My 6 yr old girl loves it and so do I her 43 yr old mother.  Am sure Dad will too&  Good price compared to others on market.  Prompt delivery.  Very pleased with it.  have also used it dry as a run for zoo zoo hamsters and hex bugs. Big so need space."
2760,836,5," My 7 year old boy LOVES this toy& and I knew he would. I am so impressed with the price and the quality of it. The plastic is not cheap or flimsy but robust and pretty thick. The rubber seals around the joints work a treat. The selection of water vehicles is interesting and fun and I love that you can turn the handle on one of the pop-in bits and create a current to send the boats round the canals. It is possible to play with this toy alone& all you do is sit near the pump and move the pop-in current maker to one of the closer sections of canal. We have lego divers swimming around and the odd matchbox car dropping in for a swim just to add to the fun. Now looking for the add on toys for this series :O)"
2761,836,5," This Waterplay set is amazing and lots of fun for my grandchildren. The quality of the product is very good and it was easy to assemble. Great value for money."
2762,836,5," HAVE JUST BOUGHT THIS FOR GRANDSON& MY OWN SON HAD THIS WHEN HE WAS TINY IT NEVER WORE OUT AND HE NEVER TIRED OF IT I GAVE IT TO THE NEIGHBOURS KIDS AFTER 10 YEARS OF USE. KIDS HAVE SO MUCH FUN WITH THIS AND HAVING A SMALL AMOUNT OF WATER THEY ARE SAFE HOWEVER VERY LITTLE ONES STILL NEED WATCHING."
2763,836,3," My little boys loves this but I find it impossible me to put together without leaks. Maybe there's a nack to it that I haven't found yet."
2764,836,3," First one came with part missing and so did replacement which arrived a day later... But I had naughtily taken one piece of connection when returning previous box so that if there was a problem I wouldn't have to build dismantle rebox again.  And sure enough the replacement which was brand new too had one piece missing (connector) ... But I had the spare piece !! So relieved!  I hope the manufacturer/supplier recognises this problem"
2765,836,1," This looks like it could be fun but if your a single mum with no strong hands around do not buy this as its impossible to put together.it says just click together so very not true.So i managed to get a friend who fixed it together.it lasted all of 5 min ..As soon as we put the water in it leaked out so we have not been able to use this.very frustrating watching my child so upset coz it didnt work"
2766,837,5," Bought this in 2008& i was a super buy& at the time I remember being sent this instead of a red smaller one& and feeling a bit disappointed as it was too big&for my baby back then&  and now I'm so glad of it& it works great as a ball pit& as a small paddling pool at the beach& at home in the garden used for sand tray& and back on holiday as a push around  Water with baby sat up& then when they grow bigger with two paddles they did it themselves& in our pool& and then mummy was behind it pushing at full force and making waves& then 6 yrs on& it is too small& for a 6 yr old we now shall give it to the nursery for their outside fun filled time and hope the memories are shared too&"
2767,837,5," Really cute inflatable was great in pool and kept a one year old (who was just pushed around in it) out of the cold water but was able to join in the fun"
2768,837,5," My son loved playing in this in the house while the weather outside wasn't good. We have not used this in a swimming pool as it was more for decoration for a space party for kids."
2769,837,5," Our 2 year loves this!"
2770,837,1," The delivery of this item was spot on but when we blew it up for our little boy it lasted less than 24 hours.  The seam between the body of the rocket and the front |dashboard| had split leaving an unfixable hole.  Our son isn't rough with his toys and he was really upset that his rocket had to go in the bin. Really shoddy and disappointing.  I know this wasn't expensive but I would have expected it to at least last until we were on holiday!Wouldn't recommend this product at all."
2771,838,4," This was bought for my 4 year old son after he spent a whole afternoon playing with someone elses. Both he and my 6 year old both enjoy playing with it a great deal. The individual bits have also become very popular in the bath& especially the pump.Only minor caution is that despite (or because of) my great care putting the seals on& some of them leak& so put towels down if you're using it indoors."
2772,838,5," My son had this for his 6th birthday and he loves it (so does his 9 year old sister& his friends& his Daddy& relatives& and me!) We spent hours playing with it. It is fun and even educational- teaching about locks and water (waves& floating/sinking& water power etc.) Not sure if ours leaked as we were making a mess which was even more fun. I wouldn't use it inside as it is good to let the children play without worrying they are going to make a mess. It is great that this set can be added to if you want to. I was worried about spending this amount of money but it is well worth it. It is great to have a change from the usual toys (trains& cars). Great toy."
2773,839,4," Excellent value for money. A good size for up to 3 young children. Bought this to use as a ball pool for the winter and paddling pool for the summer and its great. Only disappointment is that there is a whole bunch of text that covers up the pictures and so doesn't lookas good as the pics. Prompt delivery however."
2774,839,5," Great for little boys& and bigger boys also fit in too. It's much more cheerful than the photos look. First one had a hole in the middle ring. Amazon returns worked a treat and picked up from our hose& return sent within a few days. Replacement is perfect."
2775,839,5," Grandchildren had great fun in this product but did not arrive as soon as expected never the less good value"
2776,839,3," ok"
2777,840,5," Fast delivery& good value& recommended& ideal for a little and friend."
2778,841,5," It is what it is& absolutely nothing wrong with it& its actually a very good size& we use it as an indoor ball pit and about 4 one year olds will happily sit in it. Buy it!"
2779,841,4," This is just the job for visiting young grandchildren - not sure if it would stand up to prolonged daily usage but that is not why I got it!"
2780,841,4," A good sized pool - not so big it takes a week to fill& not too small for our 6"
2781,841,5," So lucky to have this heatwave even I have been in the pool cooling off with the gradchildren - so far so good though at that price if it punctures its not a tragedy either -Kids love it - wouldn't say it was big enough for kids over 7  but under that age its perfect"
2782,841,5," Very good value for a small pool& useful for water in the summer and for a ball pool inside in the winter."
2783,841,5," My daughter wanted a small play pool for her 21 month old daughter during this hot summer.  The product arrived promptly and was a perfect size for a toddler."
2784,841,1," I ordered a 3 ring pool as described and pictured& but what I actually received was a similar looking 2 ring pool. I was not informed about this by the seller and only realised the mistake when prompted to post a review. Sending out a product of lesser value and not informing the customer& also not immediately refunding the difference is unacceptable customer service. To top it off the pool I received had a 1mm diameter hole in the top ring as a result of a manufacturing defect& so it deflated within minutes of inflating.Despite these issues the seller immediately accepted return and full refund incl. return carriage. However& to save the hassle of returning the item and being without a paddling pool for my kids (essentially I still received a paddling pool)& I was able to repair the hole quickly and easily with the repair patch provided and the seller agreed to refund the Â£2 difference between the pool I received and the one I purchased.I'm satisfied that I was able to come to an amicable agreement with the seller& but dissapointed at not receiving exactly what I ordered and not being immediately notified about it."
2785,841,5," Excellent value and very good service from seller.  Bought this as ball pool for my 15 month old twins and they love it. Hours of fun diving into it but have spent loads on balls to fill it as its a very roomy pool. But kids love it."
2786,842,4," This toy was purchased for my two sons aged 3 and 1. It was very much enjoyed by both of them. The youngest enjoyed playing with the pump and splashing in the water however my eldest gained the most from playing and it led to discussions about dams and water flow etc. they quite literally have spent all day playing with this toy in the sunshine and it was money well spent!"
2787,842,1," I really wanted this to work especially as it was my son's birthday present.  We never got the pump to work so the lick gates didn't work.  This was also true of the replacement Amazon promptly sent.  There's also a major design flaw that when you hold it by the carry box handles then the bits fall out of the big holes in the bottom."
2788,842,4," Easy to put together and take apart. The children loved it from my 2 year old to even the grandparents. Great fun had by all."
2789,842,5," My 2 and 4 year old absolutely love this& they've had great fun pushing the boat"
2790,842,5," My niece loves this& something for her to play with in the garden when she visits& just fix together& fill with water and away they go& keeps them cool and playing for hours& my only gripe some of the accessories are a little expensive for what they are.But this is worth buying it has bits and pieces with it already."
2791,842,3," It is a noch Water toy but expected it to be more fun. The pump is not really working and the car can only go a tiny way.... My two year old girl ( and she loves water and can play with it for ours) was not too impressed"
2792,842,4," Love this& small enough for indoor play& kept children busy for a long time working it all out. Only 4 stars as instructions for assembly were minimal and you have to dismantle to make it portable."
2793,842,5," Excellent& my granddaughter loved it for her 2nd birthday and my 3 year old grandson had a great time& so a complete success. Actually the 9 and 11 year old granddaughters liked helping."
2794,843,5," No frills& just a basic smaller paddling pool that fitted both my sons when i visited my mum.I find the larger ones are hard work and my two lose interest after a while."
2795,843,5," Good basic paddling pool at a good price of Â£3.58& although it seems to be double that price now. Attractive and a reasonable size."
2796,843,5," Description doesn't mention size - which is about 1.4 metres (from memory) - perfect for my two year old."
2797,843,5," Had loads of hammer over a long time now. No problems."
2798,844,5," My four year old little brother really liked his nemo swimming items. would recommend although they are on the smaller side. lovely bright colours."
2799,844,3," It's does have nemo om both sides. As it has instruction and some information on the back of arm bands"
2800,844,4," Son loves it but defenitly sutiable for younger children x"
2801,844,5," Good for the money."
2802,845,5," Hours of fun& worth every penny. More cost effective than having lots of days out in the summer& and loads more fun."
2803,845,4," Very good& do what it says in the instructions and ensure ground level before filling pool.  Kids love it they are never out of it."
2804,845,4," Well packaged and easy to get set up.  A very good value product that is just the ticket.  The pool is made of a very durable material and we have had it out in all weathers in a very demanding climate."
2805,845,5," Whats not to love. Amazing for the kids and grownups alike. Beware though the ground has to be 'PERFECTLY'  level and you do need to maintain it so be prepared for and extra chore. Unfortunately i cant comment on the pump as i 2 as sent one with a 2 pin plug. I was given a refund of 15 but still had to pay another 10 to get a pump-so value for money wise i feel a bot let down"
2806,845,5," We are delighted with this pool& it has made our summers in Greece a much cooler experience. Easy set-up and whilst it does take time to fill-up it is worth the wait."
2807,845,1," This is the third pool we bought. Fairly easy to put up. The kids loved it& but only lasted 3 weeks until the top part popped. Extremely difficult to repair. Have since bought a steel framed pool and wished I'd bought this in the first place"
2808,845,4," Had to return this product due to it being unsuitable but that was my fault not the product.  It's immaculately presented and of very good quality.  If you're lucky enough to need one of these then look no further. A great product. My error was poor measuring of space for this rather generous pool."
2809,845,4," perfect size and perfect depth.you can relax or get fully submerged.strong material & but do not leave out threw winter (30c to 5c degrees)."
2810,846,3," Good size& sturdy& comes with a patch if we do get a leak but survived so far without it. Only criticism is that there is no way to get the water out without using a bucket (or a strong man to turn it over!"
2811,846,1," Very disappointed. The size of the pool is no way near the size as described in fact it's at least 5 inches smaller on the width& length and dept (yes I have measured it). You could no way fit a fully grown adult and two children like the picture in the pool. Great if you are after a smaller pool at a higher price than others but do not buy thinking the measurements are correct."
2812,846,1," We just inflated the pool and it is much smaller than described on the box and site: Instead of 2.0x1.5x0.5m it is 1.8x1.3x0.4m. This is a rip-off - very disappointed!"
2813,846,5," Quick delivery and the pool was perfect for what we needed having 2 young children 3 and under its big enough and deep enough for playing& swimming and splashing. Only slight issue valves to pump pool up are large and comes with no adapter. Other than that great buy"
2814,846,5," We love this pool big enough for 5 little kids to play in . It doesn't have a plug which is a pain but you can empty it very quickly buy deflating it& or empty it by bucket which is useful as you can water the plants so water isn't wasted. Overall very pleased with pool perfect for a nice summers play."
2815,846,1," very disappointed with this product the description clearly states its 79| long x 59 | its not - its only 73| x 51|  - how hard can it be to advertise the correct size - would not of purchased this if  it had the correct sizes advertised"
2816,846,5," Lovely size & very sturdy and lovely bright colour . I was really pleased with it as it allows about 3 wee ones in safely ."
2817,846,5," This was an excellent compromise on size. There are larger pools but they need a LOT more water to fill them. This is just right.It's easy to inflate (although designed for use by a pump rather than by mouth) I had an electric pump already and it was done in seconds. 4 people can easily sit in it. The bottom is quite thin& though& so if you have a bumpy lawn expect to feel every bump when you sit in this.There is a plug at the bottom& to make draining easy. The only negative thing to say is that the box states that a repair patch is included but I didn't get one. Otherwise& this is an excellent pool and just the right size for a family."
2818,847,4," We bought this product for our child. I thing is good material. I like the how does look like& nice material that is not reflecting to much the sun light& it is very big enough for me so I can play with my child."
2819,847,3," A cheap and basic pool& quite difficult to inflate without a pump but value for money.  It is good quality material so should should stand up to normal wear and tear."
2820,847,5," Son loves it age 8& easy to inflate but need pump& we just used air bed pump& great for small garden.Definatly recommend"
2821,848,5," I ordered this on a wednesday and it was with me by Friday morning& now that is super quick! My 8 year old son loves it and has had lots of fun this summer in his new boat. Its a good quality product."
2822,848,5," I wanted a small one for my 4 year old& and it really is small just right for what we wanted. It states suitable for one adult& I'm not massive 5'4| and struggle to get in& but its perfect for small to medium children. I really think this is great value& a must have& so much fun and easily packs away.  You do need a seperate pump& a manual hand one is fine. There are some sets with a pump included& or you may have a proper pump already if you have other boats."
2823,848,4," It was delivered in one week. it is big enough to sit 2 little Children(3 and 5). But we can't inflate the bottom of the boat& and the instruction doesn't show how to inflate the bottom part."
2824,848,2," First time out it developed a split along a seam and the returns process was so difficult decided not to bother - thought it would be better than turned out to be given description"
2825,848,5," Great little buy the children love it and we have managed to safely get a 5 year old& 7 year old and 8 year old in it.  Quick delivery and a sturdy piece of kit."
2826,849,4," My Twin boys loved it.Easy to inflate and deflateNice colour and printAvrage size& not too deep& can leaks easily as the thickness is not much"
2827,849,5," Just what I wanted and expected& quite small and good for bathing the dog!!"
2828,850,4," These are perfect arm bands for children& with two places to inflate on each.  Im happy I got good value for money here"
2829,850,5," Fast delivery brill very happy with the arm bands as I got 2 sets thank you very much more than happy"
2830,850,5," Love the design and fits well&bright colours &my kid loves them&great value for the price&exactly what was described in the add."
2831,850,2," My son loved these arm bands and wanted to wear them for our next swimming session.  All was great& except one of the stoppers does not stay in properly and the air keeps escaping which made the arm-bands useless."
2832,850,1," bought these for my 18mth old son and they hardly kept him afloat :/"
2833,850,5," Grand daughter loves them so much she wears them in the bath at home"
2834,851,5," The best float on the market& I bought one of these 5 years ago and had to replace it and everyone on our holiday was asking us where we got it. And the best way to sunbathe and keeping cool"
2835,852,5," Very jolly colours with moveable parts for toddler to play with.  Ideal size for  baby with interesting decoration to keep attention."
2836,853,5," I purchase these for my little 3 year old and he loves them. Floats have given him so much more confidence in the pool and he loves toy story."
2837,854,5," Fantastically priced and easy to use paddling pool for these hot days (make the most of them!).  Unfortunately my garden isnt completely level& so one side of the pool didnt stay completely upright when filled but didnt spoil the kids enjoyment!  Big enough to muck around in as I got the 6ft one.  Just right for sunny weather!!"
2838,855,5," Very nice product for the price. My Son's 2 and a half and a bit big for his age and they were a very good fit. Although they were dispatched promptly they didn't arrive but when i contacted the seller they were quick to respond and sent out a new pair which were received very quickly."
2839,855,5," bought these arm bands for my little girl for our holiday and they served a purpose.  she loved the little fish on them and didnt seem to mind wearing them so guess they were confortable!"
2840,855,5," Arrived on timeTried"
2841,855,5," There isn't a lot you can say about armbands- however& I liked these as they were a bit different& bright"
2842,855,5," I bought 2 of these for my twin toddlers who are under 3 and it does prove to be excellent to keep them afloat even when I leave them on their own& Of course within my easy reach. The quality is really good and the colourful design is loved my by li'l ones. I'd surely recommend this product even for under 3s."
2843,855,5," Fantastic value for money.  Bright& cheerful picture and colour.  At least not many people seem to have these& so don't run the risk of someone stealing them (that's what happened to our last pair).  Most importantly& they don't go down!"
2844,855,5," These are the best armbands we've ever had and my daughter loves them.. They only take a few seconds to inflate or deflate&they are bright&colourful and have a lovely design. They also appear durable.A complete bargain."
2845,855,5," They are good support! Neutral design suitable for boys and girls! If blow too much air& my child's arms could not fit in and if yes& could with red marks& even in wet condition. So just don't blow too much air in."
2846,856,1," We really liked the look of this paddling pool"
2847,856,5," we have had this paddling pool in and out the garage& and its still in perfect condition. The kids have been playing with it for the last two weeks and it has with stood lots of rough play. Its not very deep but enpugh for the kids to enjoy. The cannon is great and stays put& and the sword have with stood lots of play."
2848,856,4," Great fun toy& especially when full of water. As with any blow up toy& you may have to keep blowing it up as air inevitably seeps out a little. The mast with the flag on doesn't stand up straight but tends to be at about 45 degrees. My 4 year old boy and his mates love this toy and wack each other repeatedly with the swords until one cries and we we take them away! The water cannon is surprisingly powerful and accurate but we are on a water meter - D'oh!"
2849,856,5," Grandchildren rate it but wont inflate it! i have a compressor &might benefit if it had its own pump like camping beds."
2850,856,5," This is great. My 4 and half year old and 2 year old daughters saw it and asked for it& and what a great choice.  Ive not noticed the wheel or the flag tilt over& their still straight& and its been pumped up (we blew it up manually) for over a week& with only a quick top up in that time. Its a good size too& im 5ft 5ins and can lie down in it almost straight. The girls love it so all good!"
2851,856,3," got this for my sons 3rd birthday as he loves boats"
2852,856,4," Lovely pool& my 3yr old loved it on sight& am a little disappointed tho that the mast dosnt stay upright& it dosnt deflate& just tends to flop down into pool after being out a short while& over all tho a really nice little pool for toddlers and much fun to ba had with imaginative pirate play"
2853,856,5," Excellent& my children have had so much fun in this. It's been left out in all weathers and remains strong and still brightly coloured. They sail in it and shoot water from the cannon whenever it's sunny ."
2854,857,5," awesome piece of kit..........made for nutters with a rabbid problem .......me and my mrs are such people........someone said that kids can buy these??? I mean kids.....playing with kids toys????.......whats the world comeing to????? BAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!"
2855,858,1," We are on our second one of these.  Each time& the slide part has torn away from it's fitting and punctured& despite just having  two young children sliding down it.  Not exactly heavy use.  They love it while it lasts& but are upset a few days later when it's broken."
2856,858,5," Firstly& let me say how big the Rainbow Ring Play Centre is.........HUGE!!!!  Not a bad thing though as if you have very young kids& there is plenty of space in either of the pools to get in with them for supervision.  For older kids& there should be enough room for a good few of them to get in without contention tantrums. :)The material and seams appear to be very durable& having had to drag this around the garden a few times to reposition it.  The shower nozzle is a fun feature and has an adapter to fit a Hozelock-equipped hose& but beware....the shower nozzle needs securing or it thrashes about under the hose water pressure and soaks more than the pool occupants!The biggest feature (literally) is also the biggest drawback"
2857,858,5," Brilliant product! Just the right size for 2-5 year olds. Will need an electric pump to inflate it. It is a nightmare to clean but as are most inflatable pools. Highly recommend!"
2858,858,5," We have had 2 summers worth of fun out of this and it is still in good working order. Thank you."
2859,858,5," Great item& my children love it& so many features they dont get bored. Glad I bought an electric pump for it though as it is rather large! Fab product"
2860,858,5," Fantastic pool for the younger kids! But remember to buy electric pump first as takes a while to pump up! I would highly recommend!!"
2861,858,1," The only positive thing about this product is the timely delivery& for which you pay big money. Instructions are insufficient. I spent several hours trying to inflate this monster using the electric pump I bought especially for this product. It is a lot of fun when kids are all ready to get in and you cannot move it once it is inflated. Try to find pump long enough so as the monster is more than 2 meters away from any structure (as required by the product). Well& after spending 3 hours inflating (I took breaks) it looked ready. We filled it with water. We did not even finished when we realized the monster deflates!!! I checked all the valves - they were closed. I did not find any hole& but there must be something somewhere that makes the air disappear from the main (bottom) ring. Now I have to sort the return& pay for it (on top of the money for the delivery and money for the pump). STAY AWAY!!"
2862,858,5," My grandchildren can't wait for the hot weather to get in to this fabulous pool.  Bring on the sun soon"
2863,859,5," brilliant buy& powerful like it said"
2864,859,5," Greay"
2865,860,5," Great"
2866,861,5," Got this pool end of May 2015  well worth the money realy big my grandson loves it  we could all get in  it's great"
2867,861,4," It is a good deep pool and good value for money"
2868,861,5," Great buy& decent size"
2869,862,5," I've had this item on my wish list for a while as I knew my son would love it in the summer but the price was a little high.Eventually it can down to under Â£20 so I bought it. It arrived quickly and I got it out excited to see it but also to check the size as some people said it was smaller then they thought. I then looked at options to blow it up and it is a wide hole for the body and a small water wings style for the tail. Now unless you have the lung capacity of a blue whale I suggest buying a pump.I ordered the one suggested and this takes about 5 minutes to blow up each section. When done it really is a great piece of kit and enough room for 2 toddles with plenty for maybe a third. My son loved it and was playing in it despite the lack of water.A must in summer and good quality with the added shade of the tail."
2870,862,5," I brought this for my daughter when she was about 8 months old and it was a good depth for her to sit in (assisted of course!) then as she grew the pool got more and more use.  On really hot days it is ideal to put the whale's jet on and kids can run through it and the whale's tail acts as an excellent shelter in the hot sun.  We had hours of fun with this pool and it doesn't take long to fill up!"
2871,862,5," Excellent quality&fast delivery&great price.My kids loved it and they cant wait to get it back out for next summer.Cant get any better then that.."
2872,862,5," I purchased this pool on a whim as it was in a flash sale and I could not leave it for the price! I wasn't sure what to expect but I was so pleased when it arrived.Due to the awful summer we are experiencing& I have only used it twice but we had hours of family fun with it. The pool can comfortably fit 3 babies/young toddlers with a little room to spare. My son is now 20 months and can stretch out and still have another length before he reaches the other side. You will need a pump to blow the pool up& there are 2 sections which take a few minutes to inflate. I purchased Milestone Camping AC240V/140W AC Electric Air Pump inflator/deflator for airbeds paddling pools"
2873,862,5," Bought this for a family party where we had two small children coming& they had a great time& the spray worked well so all in all an excellent purchase. The pool is quite robust so lived up to expectation. Fortunately we had an electric pump to blow it up as it is quite big. Put away now for next years party!!"
2874,862,3," Smaller than I imagined& and the tail comes quite a way over the pool area& not a great problem& but the whale pool I bought some years ago was better. Not had a chance for the grandchildren to use it yet so not sure how it will go with them."
2875,862,5," This is a fantastic paddling pool& great value for money. We pumped it up with a bike footpump as it would be impossible to blow it up yourself! The squirting tale is a great feature that the kids absolutely love"
2876,862,5," Bought it this summer as my 2 year old niece was visiting. What a buy! It is bigger than expected& good quality and she loved it. Lots of fun was had and she loved the spray which gave added fun."
2877,863,4," It is a miracle this arrived intact as there was no packaging either over or in the box& which spilled its contents on the doorstep as it was delivered. There were only the most minimal instructions as to how to assemble the unit& and for a long time I feared that the pump& possibly the most important element& was not working"
2878,863,5," great play for children in the warm months.  Kids just love mucking about with water and I love play equipment that children can play with and use their imagination and interact with each other instead of just pushing buttons indoors.  Easy to assemble and light enough to move about."
2879,863,4," We have used similar one at our nursery for years and the kids love it. Chose this particular model as it exactly fits on an outdoors metal table.  Would recommend you seal joins with clear mastic otherwise water does seep out no matter how well you press joins together"
2880,863,4," This is a well designed toy which will give the children fun and entertainment. Well made& although putting the peel off rubber seals on the joint pieces was tricky. Not a lot of plastic for the money though - best bought second hand?"
2881,863,2," The set is fine but it didnt come in a specific presentation box - rather an over sized standard large card board box. Not very interesting for an excited four year old.  So now have to find somwthing to put it in"
2882,864,5," I used these for years in my last teaching post& I have now moved to another school and was thrilled to find these at such a great price on Amazon. They are fantastic construction toys that work well in both dry sand and water. Great for encouraging cooperative group play. They are also lots of fun!"
2883,865,5," My son loved this outfit"
2884,866,5," Brilliant & came on time & should wear with a ripped shirt & it looks better that way"
2885,866,4," Great hulk outfit good quality"
2886,866,5," is what it is - awesome"
2887,867,5," First frozen dress did not light-up fully & but received replacement which does and my grand-daughter delighted with musical/light-up Elsa Dress.  Good price and prompt delivery"
2888,867,5," W e received &this dress in the time stated& it was well packed &the dress was just as described& and our grandaughter was over the moon& Thank You so much"
2889,867,2," Dress looked OK.  Lights didn't work.  Item delivered to neighbour without any details to us of where it was delivered"
2890,868,4," Was very good& could only wear once but looked very good on."
2891,868,5," Just what we were looking for"
2892,868,5," Looks great"
2893,868,5," great"
2894,868,1," Cheap"
2895,869,5," bought this for my grandson& as he had to dress up& for school book day & he loved it & so did his mates & good service and fast delivery"
2896,870,5," A great costume"
2897,871,4," Sizing is a tad on the small side! The top didn't fit at all. However the costume itself was very attractive and good quality. I was sorry to have to return it due to the size&"
2898,871,4," Ok for price paid& not a bad fit& quite generous size& a little see through."
2899,871,5," Great fit. Good value for money."
2900,871,5," Brilliant get up.  Easily shortened legs with double sided tape.  Fits any size clearly and I really looked the part at a local fancy dress.  Have kept it for future use!"
2901,871,4," I ordered this outfit for an abba tribute night. Delivery was good. The outfit&is fairly small fit&but looks good and is good value for money."
2902,871,5," Quick delivery really good"
2903,872,5," Well worth every penny what a surprise i got when i got home and this was being modelled what fun we both had"
2904,873,3," I think for what you pay the quality isnt good at all. Over priced. Would not recommend.  it is a good fireman sam look alike though"
2905,873,5," perfect..... just what the 3 year old wanted!"
2906,873,5," Just what I was looking for my little boy is obsessed with fireman Sam little bit pricey but what I expected for fireman Sam goods :)"
2907,874,5," Very happy and extremely impressed with delivery speed and quality :) perfect for a halloween party!"
2908,875,5," This was great for a 3 ft Santa I had made& very authentic looking. Everybody asked where I had it from. I pulled some of the curly bits out and was able to use them for his fringe.  Would definitely buy again"
2909,875,5," Excellent produce& just as advertised.  Haven't used it yet& but look forward to doing so."
2910,876,5," I really liked this costume!The |dress| was good quality and fitted well I am a size 10 and got the 8-10 size and it fitted great it is meant to be loose fitting.The tights where bog standard& but stood up to a night of partying and frequent trips to the toilet& this also included a few stumbles but the mud washed out all okay!If you're not brave like me I would opt to wear thick black tights underneath as there aren't very warm and can be a little see-through."
2911,876,4," I bought this outfit to wear for my fancy dress Peter Pan themed birthday party& and wore it with the teen girl Peter Pan wig which worked really well& I got alot of good comments from people& friends and strangers alike& it was comfortable& I got the small and it had plenty of room (I'm size 8-10) and it was pretty short on the leg (I'm 5'6''). It was a bit pricey for what it is& but it did the job and was good fun."
2912,876,5," Costume was great& would say the sizing is alot bigger than expected& i got a 8/10/12 when im a 10& and felt more like a 12/14 but except that was very wonderful!!"
2913,876,5," brillant  costume for the money i wore it with long red wig n long boots and got loads of compliments!  well pleased!"
2914,876,4," Cheap quality& however it will be fine for what I need it for. Thin fabric& becomes very static - sticks to everything! Good sizing& very flattering."
2915,876,3," Not very good quality and for an 8 - 12 it was absolutely massive!! If it didn't come with the rope belt it would have hung like a potato sack."
2916,876,4," Great costume. Only downside is that if your tall (I'm 5'9|) the tights are a bit thin so ended up buying a different paper to go with it."
2917,876,3," it was fine for a fancy dress party.  Not particularly good quality but get what you pay for."
2918,877,5," good costume"
2919,878,5," Ordered this for Roman Day at school.  Always a good time to dress up in next to nothing& at the end of January& but there you go.  Dress arrived the next day and was perfect for the job.  This size a good fit for a tall 8 year old.  Didn't stand up well to playing football with the boys at lunchtime but after a quick rinse on a wool wash it looked good again.  Many thanks for good value service."
2920,878,5," My daughter absolutely loved this dress and is using it this evening in a dance performance at our local theatre."
2921,878,4," My 10 year old loved this outfit for her greek play& fitted beautifully& although is a little see through so she wore a little vest top and leggings underneath& but otherwise was very pleased"
2922,878,5," this product was realy good & nice light fabric with the bright colours & headband with nice gold olive branch"
2923,878,4," Lovely costume for school Greek day. It is see through so had to buy white leggings and a vest top to wear under"
2924,878,5," The costume was very good value for wearing only once for school! It also arrived very fast.  It was too long for normal size 8year old& but I expected that anyway."
2925,878,5," Daughter loved this item and enjoyed wearing this at greek day at school.Nice outfit for a good price and speedy delivery.Thankyou"
2926,878,4," Lovely costume. You can see through it though so you would need to wear something underneath but overall a very good quality costume."
2927,879,4," this was a nice dress for halloween the only problem was that it was slightly too big in the waist and the arm pieces were tight making the fabric rub against my under arms quite painfully after a while. it can be itchy as well but the dress was really pretty and looks exactly like it does in the picture so I was overall pleased."
2928,879,4," Loved this dress! I thought it was brilliant for Halloween. The only thing I wasn't happy about were the arm pieces. They were attached to the dress and I didn't find this comfortable. I unpicked the stitches so they weren't attached to the dress any more and wore them on my arms. I was free to move my arms and found this much more comfortable and only took a couple of minutes to do. Had a great night and didn't have a single problem with the dress! Would definitely recommend& also the dress is stretchy so fits many sizes."
2929,879,5," Costume came on time for Halloween and exactly as described. The size (m) fitted me perfectly (size 12) and was comfortable. The only problem was that the arm pieces were attached to the dress& it would have been more comfortable if they were separate. The hat would have also been better attached to a headband. Would recommend."
2930,879,4," Arrived in good time and is exactly what my daughter needs for her fancy dress party.  As mentioned by others the sizing is quite generous which is far better than it being small.  Great buy!"
2931,879,5," Great costume& good quality item for the reasonable price it was bought for. Well designed& and well suited for fancy dress parties. A good buy!"
2932,879,3," the elastic distorted the shape of the dress i had to have it altered so it wasn't all bunched up at the back and really tight at the front."
2933,879,4," i used this for a party and it was a great costume& the arm bands were a bit itchy so i left them off& but the rest of the outfit was brill"
2934,879,5," got this for my sisters halloween party and i was the best dressed. wold reccomend to anyone looking for something diff on ha"
2935,880,5," My granddaughters wanted to play Knights and Dragons& so I ordered two of these for them. They have terrific fun with them. I'm not sure they'd stand up to the punishment meted out by older kids (mine are 2 and 4& and daintily built)& but for the price& they are certainly worth it. The kids use them for short bursts every day&and they are still fairly intact."
2936,880,4," Like all foam things& these are not destined to be long-lived but seem to be enjoyed whilst they last - a few months of rampaging and pillaging will take their toll but a great hit with the kids and doesn't damage the furniture!"
2937,880,5," The sword and shield set is beautiful and safe for young kids.  My 3 year old grandson loves it and I am not afraid he will knock something or someone down!  Great toy.  I am very pleased."
2938,881,4," its nice item but really small box."
2939,882,4," I purchased this item as a Halloween costume as I wanted to go as a zombie nurse and I though I could bloody this up a bit what with it being white.  In the end I returned the item because I chose a black nurse delirium costume instead but I had no problems with this.  As for the product itself& I couldn't fault it - the sizing and quality were perfect.  However& one thing I would point out is that the dress isn't quite so flattering if you're not gifted in the chest department like the woman modelling it.  It's also quite a long dress - not quite knee length - but longer than other fancy dress costumes I've worn in the past - so I guess that could be a good or a bad thing depending on the look you're going for.  Would definitely recommend it though!"
2940,882,4," I ordered this outfit on Wed for a night out on Sat and it was delived Sat morning which i was very please with. The material is good quality not plasticy like some cheap outfits but is slightly see through but not unwearable. I ordered Medium 12-14 and found the skirt quite a lot longer than my other friends outfits so if you want something that covers you up a bit more this is the outfit to get."
2941,883,5," This was bought for my 6yr old who wanted the Geox bands after seeing them advertised on TV. To get those you have to purchase the shoes too so I thought I would have a quick look online first.When I saw these& I called him over and showed him the picture and he was thrilled.I bought one!We got a green one as the colours you get are random but he is very pleased with it."
2942,884,5," Served a purpose."
2943,885,5," Granddaughter loved the dress was so happy with it.  Thankyou"
2944,885,3," The musical badge kept falling off"
2945,885,5," Present for my niece - she loved it! Everyone commented on how pretty the dress is& so a real hit!"
2946,886,5," very pleased with this for my halloween outfit& i am a size 14"
2947,886,4," great quality dress& though the skirt part doesnt sit out flared as the picture would lead you to believe. still very happy with it"
2948,886,5," Purchased for my  granddaughter She is delighted with the quality of this costume .Perfect for her school  party. THANK YOU."
2949,886,4," Great quality.  The skirt hangs down so can't see the panels or sleeves but we were still chuffed with dress."
2950,886,5," Perfect for Halloween and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price.  Very comfortable and fitted well - I'm 5ft 6in and size 12/14 and it was just the right length for flat shoes as well as heels."
2951,886,5," Good quality costume and excellent visually."
2952,886,1," Not happy with this product the sizing was small and there was a big hole in the back of the dress the stitching was coming undone."
2953,886,4," Bit on the small size& daughter is a size 12/14 and it was a little tight on her. Despite the size she looked great in it!"
2954,887,5," Bit weary of this sort of thing as have had some shockingly poor quality costumes in the past. This however was a pleasant surprise. It wasn't amazing quality but it wasn't terrible either. The waste coat came as part of the shirt (as in you can't take it off& they are sewn as one item) The hat made me look a bit like a train driver more than anything else and this earn quite a few laughs& I think it was at me& rather than with me& but all in the spirit of the night!It was well received at the party and luckily I was the only one dressed up as this& which is always a plus! I'm really pleased with it& it served its purpose for the night and didn't fall apart."
2955,887,5," Most people said it was the best costume at the party - I did add my own chimney sweep brush as this is not included despite what the picture shows& however the brush head is very cheap to buy. It was a good costume - a bit on the skimpy side& but then they all are - it did the job well"
2956,887,4," I bought this costume for a fancy dress weekend. The shirt is very generous but the trousers are quite tight with no give in the material. Overall a good value costume."
2957,887,4," Reasonable quality and looked good at a victorian dinner The waistcoat and shirt are attached."
2958,887,5," was grand went down a treat with the kids"
2959,887,5," Did the job perfectly. Loved it."
2960,888,5," I can say this caused a great laugh my my companys annual party.  I work in main land europe and as the only english guy I felt this was a great bit of fun :)"
2961,889,4," Ripped after first wear :( bit disappointing but overall a great suit.Wish the iron-man designed had been on the back of the suit too (instead just plain red)"
2962,889,5," Bought this for my 10 year old son who's 5ft + tall and it fits perfectly. He is really happy to have it and he says it's comfortable."
2963,889,5," Fantastic fancy dress suit! Went down a treat at my Heroes  v Villians party!"
2964,889,5," Brillant"
2965,890,4," The costume was hilarious so what could matter more? The only downside is the crotch area is particularly tight and although the size says |Large| I would not recommend buying it if you are over 6ft& even though the costume states up to 6'2|. Otherwise& brilliant."
2966,890,4," This was bought for my son as it was his sons birthday and my grandson wanted to be batman !!!Although it was for a large adult .... It was a bit tight for my 6| sonThis added to the funny side as much as the costume !!!"
2967,891,5," Had them into a party what a laugh we all had with them"
2968,892,5," Arrived in good time and well packaged. Excellent product& easy to follow instructions and easy enough to go on and remove."
2969,892,5," Great item& kids loved being All Blacks for the day"
2970,892,5," Brilliant& if a little difficult to remove after"
2971,893,3," Excellent response by the company& however the costume was much smaller than advertised.  For example my son is a small 6 year old& the costume was size 7-8& and yet was tight on my son& same fit as his other costumes size 4-5.  If I had known I would have ordered a much bigger one."
2972,893,5," Although a wee bit more expensive than I wanted to pay& I have to admit that when it arrived and I saw it& it was worth every penny. I can't wait to see my 6 year old grandson's face when he opens it. And the delivery was a lot quicker than I was told it would be."
2973,893,4," Looking at the alternatives this suit appeared the best available and my 5 year old Grandson certainly liked it. Delivery looked like it could be up to four weeks but it arrived within a week. As with many of these outfits they are not too robust and I don't expect it is going to last too long but this is the same as most. The outfit came with claws which was something not all the alternatives offered."
2974,893,3," Very expensive for an average product. Â£9 postage! Are they having a laugh! The quality is average and we bought a size 7-8 for my little boy who is a smallish 5 year old."
2975,894,4," Lovely Indian costume we bought for our daughter& great comapny to deal with and delivered in time."
2976,894,5," GreAt outfit looks good for a dress up day at school"
2977,894,5," Prompt delivery. Item as described and pretty!"
2978,895,4," Fun outfit! The colours are vibrant and the outfit is certainly reflective of the era. The fit (medium) is a bit snug& but a large would probably be too big. Will have fun wearing it on the cruise!!"
2979,895,5," My husband  had this costume for a 60th b.day party& he had lots of comments. Great buy ( dont forget the wig"
2980,895,2," Metterial ver thin"
2981,896,5," For the money& not bad - my son loves the handcuffs which are still working on Boxing Day....! I was surprised as it is obviously quite plasticky!"
2982,896,5," Great Xmas prezzie for a little policeman....pity about the gun!....but times change"
2983,896,3," Cheap and cheerful"
2984,896,5," Gift for xmas... my son is police/swat crazy"
2985,897,4," Does exactly what it says it does& what more can I say? Would not hesitate to buy it again! The hat did lack a bit of quality& but it defiantly served the purpose"
2986,898,4," I bought this for a Safari Themed Stag N ight out and ended up looking like a Hunter / Poacher :)The material used is quite itchy on the skin so I wore a white T-Shirt Underneath and the belt is flimsy and went in the bin.The leopard print on the pockets etc inspired my costume further and I bought a Leopard print belt and set the costume off with a safari hat also with some leopard print.Since wearing to the stag do I have put this through a normal wash and it survived so is now in the loft until the next opportunity arrives..."
2987,899,5," For the price these were a bargain. The quality was good and the patterns varied. There were one or two mismatches on the joins& but these would be underneath the arm when wearing& plus likelier to be in a dark venue& so insignificant. In addition to saving me hours of needle pain (and cost!) these have kept my arms warm at many a night out! Would definitely buy again."
2988,899,5," Bought these as we were holding a punk night and didn't want to go through the process of stick on tattoos or other messy rubbish.  These were absolutely spot on.  Wore some on my arms and even on my legs for the all over tattoo look.  People even came up and asked me when I had gotten tattoos!  Well worth every penny and they are reusable too."
2989,899,5," Bought these for my husband and myself for fancy dress. Good size fits my husbands arms OK. Good choice of desings"
2990,899,5," Bought these for my husband for Christmas just for fun after someone at work receiving them in secret santa at work. They are realistic from a distance - will fool people!"
2991,899,5," Fantastic sleeves! Needed these for a pop rock media project. They arrived surprisingly quickly and plenty of designs to choose from& look very realistic from a distance too which is just what I needed."
2992,899,5," Bought these for a rock themed day at work& once people saw them then on everyone wanted one& wish we had gotten more!! Designs are mixed some better than others but would recommend."
2993,899,4," Great for a fancy dress event but would not pass as the real thing. I wore them to watch a rugby match in fancy dress with the added benefit that they kept my arms warm."
2994,899,4," Good for a laugh& some designs work better than others but you get a good choice here for a good price. Not worth paying more for though& it's only five minutes of fun."
2995,900,5," The ladies had my urgent delivery sorted out with same day service - great products& made for a very fun day in the park. Stencils were easy to use with the glitter& just used moisteriser onto the skin then glitter& lasted really well."
2996,900,5," kids love this and adults"
2997,901,5," I bought this because we'd previously purchased the nail and body set and been so thrilled. This is the icing on the cake as far as my daughter is concerned. More colours and lots of transfers and a really 'cool' (her words not mine) case to house all the components when not in use and to sit the glitter pots in whilst working. As a mum this gets my vote because it's much less mess. Good buy all round!"
2998,901,5," I was pleasantly surprised with this set. It was slightly fiddly to begin with but once my daughter got the hang of it& (7 years old) the glitter tattoos came out really well! She loved this set so much she wanted another for Xmas."
2999,901,5," Really good quality tattoos with lots of designs and several glitters.  Great storage trays built in."
3000,901,5," Very Nice& high quality materials-R."
3001,901,5," I bought this for my glitter mad 8 year old& then we used it for a birthday party and all the girls loved it. The tattoos stay on for quite a while which is great from a kids point of view& but they can also be washed off without too much trouble."
3002,901,5," This is a really nice gift for a young girl.  I got these for my daughter just after she turned 11 and that seems to be the right age& say 9 to 11& just before they start experimenting with real makeup.  A good fun activity for girls."
3003,901,5," 10 year old it was for absolutely loved it"
3004,901,5," Great item& kept my daughter amused for hours. Only downfall is that the instructions are not very clear other than that would recommend"
3005,902,5," these were so handy for my 7 year old daughter very easy to apply and very easy to remove! they stayed on for the full day and didnt peak once& people stopped her on the street to ask where she got them from they were very effective for being a tattoo i smudged some fake blood around them to add more effect which worked a treat! great price easy to work with effective and fast delivery! highly recommed"
3006,902,5," I ordered these for my daughters Halloween party at school and they were great.They applied very easily and everyone said they looked great.Arrived quickly after order too."
3007,902,5," Absolutely amazing! What an absolute bargain& am buying some more for next year! Lots to choose from....they go on easily and stay on all night. So pleased :-)"
3008,902,5," very happy with them& look like they weren't going to look too realistic when i got them but they looked great"
3009,902,5," We'll made & easy to apply and looked realistic"
3010,902,5," These were great for halloween"
3011,903,4," This was a good little present and would make a good stocking filler. I suggest better packaging as the box was rather squashed on arrival."
3012,903,3," Product arrived very quickly.  We had a few issues putting the tattoos on as they are in an awkward place on the hand and it's tricky getting a good fit around the curve between the finger and thumb.  Still lots of fun though.  My kids enjoyed them."
3013,903,4," Very tricky to get on fidgety little hands& but well worth the effort once applied. Kept a party full of 3-5yo busy and lasted once dried on hands too."
3014,903,5," A lovely little stocking filler. Managed to fit on my 5"
3015,904,5," Grandchildren loved them can be like dad very easy to use"
3016,905,5," it was easy to apply. It doesn't look real& but it was still really cool. I like it very much."
3017,905,4," It looks really nice. Looks good for about 2 days on the skin the starts to look a bit tired the eventually the picture brakes up. It looked good for the occasion I needed for."
3018,905,5," Looks brilliant when on. Works like a charm& stays on for a while too.Can be difficult to remove in a hurry though...."
3019,906,4," My 3 1/2 yr old loves my little pony so I bought this as treats for when she's good. They look good"
3020,906,5," Beautiful little girly transfers. I have bought these for xmas prezzies stocking fillers and I am totally sure that they will be liked. Quick delivery and well packaged."
3021,906,4," Arrived Promptly& Tattoos okay& some didn't apply as expected& so not all the tattoo would go on& so got half a pony."
3022,906,5," Got these for my little girls birthday she loves them. Easy to apply and come off easy too once ready to be removed"
3023,906,5," These tattoos are cute and stay put for ages will buy more as daughter likes them"
3024,906,5," My children love these and we use them instead of stickers as a reward."
3025,906,5," Good quality& lasted ages once applied. Daughter very happy with them."
3026,906,5," 5 stars - great little tattoos for my niece who loves my little pony."
3027,907,5," perfect"
3028,908,5," Really really happy with this product. Delivered as described and in a reasonably quick time. No issues at all. Happy customer and I will definitely be buying again"
3029,908,5," good quality  transfer paper here"
3030,908,5," Will use again"
3031,909,4," Tattoo are a good size perfect for party bags my children really enjoyed them lasted three or four days before they faded"
3032,909,5," they are a great little party bag filler  for kids and an  excellent price& will make my little boys party extra cool!"
3033,909,2," Have used better.  Can be a little fiddly to use.  About 1 in 5 do not stick.  a little frustrating."
3034,909,4," Kids love these& excellent stocking fillersSearched a load and these were the best price"
3035,909,5," Great Tattoos- easy to apply and nice bright colours."
3036,910,5," These were a great addition to my granddaughter party bags. As they were for boys and girls it was a very good price for the one pack  I needed. They all loved them and they were easy to use and the quality was very good."
3037,910,5," Good value childrens tattoo& its very easy to apply& it had pretty much choice for all the children at the party and easy to remove with cotton and bit of oil or cream. They also last quite a while."
3038,910,4," They were just what I needed as a little extra for my daughters party bags& would have preferred them individually wrapped but that was my own fault for not checking before I ordered them"
3039,910,5," Perfect mix of tattoos for our tattoo stand at the school fete! 50p got the kids two tattoos. A great easy way to make money. All you need is a sponge and a bucket of water!"
3040,910,3," A little disappointed there were twice the amount of princess stickers to pirates as I was ordering for my son's 5th birthday party. All in all kids loved them!"
3041,910,5," Lovely variation with the tattoos. I used them for party bag fillers and tattoos are always a big hit amongst kids. Excellent price and received on time"
3042,910,5," Item arrived very quickly& as described and very securely packaged.  Extremely happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend."
3043,910,5," Excellent product. Very well recieved by my children and their friends! Arrived well before the estimated delivery date."
3044,911,3," I bought these as a bit of fun to wear as part of a |Sons of Anarchy| fancy dress theme.  The Tattoo stockings are actually quite short in length and don't quite reach wrist to shoulder as I would have preferred and reach just above my bicep.  The designs themselves are quite varied and look good.  Another thing to bear in mind is that the stockings themselves are quite light coloured so good for light coloured skin.  If you have darker skin or hairy arms& these do look a bid odd."
3045,911,5," These were bought for a metalcore concert I was taking my son to. They never made the concert but they still give loads of laughs when all the family display their tats to an unsuspecting public.Received when expected and still good fun."
3046,911,4," They look pretty good and convincing especially from a distance. The only time they fail to look good is when they crease up and where the wrist is there' a bit of fabric that's totally wrong and ruins the illusion."
3047,911,3," I bought this for a 11 year old boy. He was delighted with the present however I wasn't as pleased as the pictures weren't great. For the price and the delight on the childs face it was ok"
3048,911,5," Excellent delivery& the items does the trick& nobody could notice is not a real one. If you have a tatoo / rock party& that is the product you need"
3049,911,3," There a good idea but need to be longer as don't reach to the top of your arm and the socking needs to be a bit more clearer but not bad item"
3050,911,5," I always wanted some of these and after purchase I can not say I am disappointed at all!Speedy delivery and great quality."
3051,912,5," Fast delivery& reasonable price. Quality product."
3052,912,4," Brilliant pattern"
3053,912,3," Lasted a day"
3054,913,4," Kids absolutely love this product. In different cases it may have been different as the tattoos did come off quickly but that wasn't a problem for what I was using them for. All round good."
3055,913,4," My little 4yr old boy thought these were great and he looked like a |rock star|...I thought some were a little 2 old looking for a child& but overall a good buy."
3056,913,1," Pack Of 40+ Designs Fake Pretend Temporary Childrens Tattoos For BoysDo not last longer than a few hours& rub out easily."
3057,913,1," These arrived and looked great& they went on fine but did not last at all. Within an hour they had started rubbing off much to my kids displeasure."
3058,913,5," Maybe for kids but took em on holiday and when I came back I and others were full of taned shapes and animals imprinted"
3059,913,3," Looked great but but in 30 min they where piling& half gone by the evening and complitly  gone by the morning"
3060,913,2," Soon came off.Really not very good.Still for the price what can you expect.My son was still disappointed."
3061,913,5," A great selection. My son had trouble choosing which to use to go with his outfit for school mufti day."
3062,914,2," This was a present which was well received& however the parent was not too happy after a week of trying to wash the ink away& it still remains!"
3063,914,5," Fun for families if you have kids who like drawing on themselves"
3064,914,5," gift item so cant say much as no feedback"
3065,914,5," Happy with product"
3066,915,4," Used these stencils twice before at my community events. The children really love the different choices of stencils to pick from. The size of stencil is perfect for children under 10yrs. I really loved the speed in which I received my stencil.....next day.  I would recommend this product for children's party."
3067,915,5," The Glitter Tree never let me down! Perfect purchase yet again. I will be back soon for more. Thank you"
3068,915,5," Arrived on time& kids loved the design& easy to use& will order more when needed"
3069,915,4," Was  very happy with my pur house do u ha e peppa pig tattoos"
3070,915,5," Good product and fast delivery thanks you ðŸ˜Š"
3071,916,4," pleased with purchase. Instructions provided. Easy to apply. The appear to last days on the kids. Good after sales service"
3072,917,5," Always a hit with the kids!!"
3073,917,3," Children liked them"
3074,918,5," although very small transfers they do work if you follow instructions&grandson loved them&excellent service and fast despatch."

3078,918,5," Great"
3079,919,5," Great for the kids& and washes off easily."
3080,920,5," I bought this for a friend who is considering at tattoo to see what they thought of the size and design. He loved it and it lasted ages!"
3081,920,5," Looks Good and can't wait to try it.  Quite happy to use temporary tattoos rather than the real thing so as long as it lasts a reasonable time I'll be pleased to renew when I need another."
3082,920,5," Easy to apply& easy to remove& looks great and gets loads of comments."
3083,920,3," Long lasting and look like the real thing would buy again."
3084,920,5," Lasted perfectly for 4 days or so"
3085,920,5," Looks good& not used yet."
3086,921,5," My 3 year old son was very happy with the minion tattoos."
3087,921,3," Smaller than I hoped"
3088,921,5," As expected"
3089,922,5," Nails transfers are great.  Stayed on for a couple of days."
3090,922,3," Eye ones were great& lip ones pretty useless sadly."
3091,922,5," Easy to use and easy to take off"
3092,922,5," great"
3093,923,5," These are fascinating& the adults were amazed as much as the kids and they were the highlight of all the Christmas presents! The only thing though is that they seem to work better still on the paper than they do once actually on skin but still highly recommend and my kids have put a few on their books so we can see them come to life over and over again."
3094,923,5," fantastic party piece& works well most of the time"
3095,924,5," Bought this as a stocking filler for my 6 year old daughter and it was very well received. She loved it and so did her 3 year old sister. Only problem _ there were not enough tattoos in their opinion!!  I would recommend 1 per person if you were buying this as a party kit."
3096,924,5," This was very much loved by my kids at christmas& perfect for small girls& gives them a lot of fun activity... perfekt& mina tjejer Ã¤lskade den hÃ¤r party samlingen!:)"
3097,924,3," Is what you expect really.  Daughter liked it&  A little pricey for what it is perhaps!  Probably could put own kit together for less money."
3098,924,4," Gave this to friend's daughter for her birthday& she loved it! Kind of present that little girls love and mums may not be so keen on!"
3099,925,5," Great value transfers& that have a good realistic look about them.  Easy to apply just cut out a scar& stick it printed side down and soak the backing paper with a damp cloth& wait 30 seconds and carefully peel of the backing paper.  The transfer will stay on your skin& but is easy enough to remove with make up remover or baby oil."
3100,926,5," Children loved it as we used these for a farewell party. Very happy to see kids enjoying the tatoos. Cheers"
3101,927,2," Got these for birthday party. The look good in the add as the contained  48 tattoos of about 4 different kinds. Unfortunately when the arrived I had only 2 kinds. I got 4 of one kind and 44 of the other. Not very good is it. I haven't used then yet so don't know how long the last. Be careful when buying picture doesn't always match."
3102,927,5," My Grandson loved these Tattoos and had a great time with his friends. They had hours of fun. Would buy them again."
3103,927,5," Great for kids on rugby tour& stayed on well and easy to use."
3104,928,5," My son loved them.  Great for minion fans go on well and last a few days."
3105,928,5," All ok kids loved them good value for money"
3106,928,5," Great product"
3107,929,5," Great looking roses that will grow on you!  Pleased with this purchase."
3108,929,1," Expensive and poor quality ...not worth it"
3109,929,5," Good purchase"
3110,929,5," great product"
3111,929,5," Nice"
3112,930,5," My son really loved these tattoos - there are plenty to choose from and you can re use so not just a one off - great buy"
3113,931,3," daughter loved them& however they took a long time to come off & would of given more stars if i dint have to scrub my daugters arm off"
3114,931,4," My little boy loves these tattoos. Good quality as last days"
3115,931,5," These tattoos come in decent pictures - not like some of the horrors I have seen! They were really easy to cut out and use& went on with no hassle and washed off easily& without scrubbing. Very good& will it again."
3116,931,1," Awful tattoos couldn't get them to work at all! I've run the 'tattoo stall' at the school fete before so know what I'm doing lol but these were terrible - old stock?!?"
3117,931,4," Went on easy& fell off just as easily& very good if you want a single day tattoo& look elsewhere if you need something thats a little longer lasting."
3118,931,5," Our grandsons love these. They last for a beds too. Arrived quickly. Well packaged. I definitely recommend these tattoo for young boys."
3119,931,5," Excellent tattoos. The children at my daughters birthday party loved them& and the good news is that they wash off quite eay too!"
3120,931,5," Excellent tattoos. The children at my daughters birthday party loved them& and the good news is that they wash off quite eay too!"
3121,932,5," got this as a christmas present& it's a little on the small side& but for the price i paid i'm not complaining ! my mate loved it and she's now going to get a dream catcher tattooed on her ! good stuff"
3122,932,4," smaller than expected for price to be honest :s very small tattoos ............ but pretty none the less so overall not bad"
3123,932,5," Daughter bought for a birthday present for a friend. packaging perfect for the item price good too everyone happy thanks"
3124,932,5," My 16yr old granddaughter loved it and ii must admit it is better than a tattoo  it looked very nice when on ."
3125,933,4," These were a joke present for a friend who has a habit of turning up to parties in |unexpected attire|.For that purpose they worked well and from a distance of two or three metres caused more than one person to think that some serious inking had taken place.  They don't stand up to close scrutiny but they weren't expected to.More convincing than some of the more elaborate and coloured designs."
3126,933,5," Well pleased I know my cousin will like them very much as I bought it as a joke for his 40th birthday :-))"
3127,934,5," Arrived very quickly& pretty designs. bought it for my daughter's birthday party and it went down very well. Simple instructions& fairly simple to get off too. Happy!"
3128,934,4," I love these tattoos& the selection is extensive and they stay on for ages when you apply them correctly.  My little girls love them!"
3129,934,4," I bought these tattoos for my daughter's 8th birthday party.  They were great and went down a treat with all the girls.  There was a good variety of designs and sizes within this pack.  They also stay on for a good while.  The only downfall was trying to get them off.  This did take a while and the glitter rubbing on the arm was really quite sore."
3130,934,5," These tattoos are fabulous for age& gender and sexual preferences! Easy to use& great colours and lovely patterns. They last a day or so but can be easily removed with a bit of nail varnish remover if you're desperate to get them off."
3131,934,5," Every holiday I spend a small fortune getting tattoos for the kids. They invariably wash off in the sea or get scratched off on the beach. So I thought I'd try these. Excellent! A whole pack for not much more than a single tattoo from a vendor. You can even sparkle it up if you dab a speck of glittery eye shadow on it while its still wet. My little girl adored them. She was pretty much covered on some days! I will be buying theses for her birthday and next holiday too!"
3132,934,4," I got my daughter this product for her Birthday Party in November.She had great fun putting them on with her friends and the colours are bright and look good on. Almost three weeks later and many& many baths they were still on her arms. I did manage to get them off with some baby oil and much rubbing in the end.I would still recommend but would advise to get some body oil in to help remove them."
3133,934,3," We used these for children at a party - both girls and boys loved them. They look very pretty and they last for ages.  We needed to remove them after a couple of days and found them very difficult to remove."
3134,934,5," A great selection of tattoos for little girls with lots to choose from.  My daughter loves these and the only problem i have is getting her to wash them off lol"
3135,935,5," Ideal as a test to see if a tattoo would suit your arm& etc. Very convincing and attractive designs. Easy to apply. However& they did wash off easily& despite the instructions saying the contrary."
3136,936,5," Last well& don't wash of easyl so don't put on hands if going to school tomorrow! Will buy again"
3137,936,4," Bought as gifts but looked nice."
3138,936,5," Great"
3139,937,5," I bought these for my daughters 1D birthday party in December. The tattoos were a big hit and all the girls wanted on on their arm unfortunately I did not bank on them being such good quality and the tattoos stayed on for weeks! In the school nativity all the angels and Mary had 1D glitter tattoos !! Very funny to see.Good value"
3140,937,5," I ordered this for my friend for her daughter as a Christmas present who loves one direction she was really chuffed."
3141,937,4," quite good."
3142,938,5," Great value"
3143,939,5," Come in 2 packs of 12 in underwhelming but& dare I say it& effective resealable& small plastic bags.Tattoos are retro looking and would be great if some superwomen had been included too but overall the 3 year old kids absolutely loved them and they looked bright on black& white and pink skin.Arrived in around 4 days from order.Highly recommend."
3144,939,3," Funky retro design at a bargain price& my son can't wait to pack them in to loot bags for his party guests. The only issue I have is that they are packaged in sheets of six but I was expecting  them to be packaged individually as the image above suggest. I am planning to give 2 per guest but will have to separate them which is a bit inconvenient. If it was made clear in the product description& I would have purchased more to give each guest a set each."
3145,939,5," I always buy tattoos like this for my children's parties as it is a great extra little activity that doesn't come with a high cost.  These tattoos are really easy to apply unlike some I have previously purchased which take a lot of effort and time to get them to come off of the backing paper in one piece.  These are so easy to use that some of the children (5 years old) were able to put them on themselves with very little help.  Most of the time they come off very easily (especially when they are on hands) however I have found that when they are placed on an area where they don't get rubbed by clothing they can be a bit stubborn to remove.  When this happens using baby oil on a cotton pad helps to remove it."
3146,939,5," I keep a collection of tattoos for varios kids' parties and outings. These are bright& work well& delivered on time. Not that they stand out or last longer than others but they are good for the price and boys like them."
3147,939,2," Got these for my children. Some of the tattoos are off centred so When you separate them from each other you lose part of the tattoo. Was a little disappointed even though I didn't expect them to be perfect as they were so cheap. This may have been a printing mistake. The pictures are good for what they cost and my children enjoyed the ones we could save.Packaging was good."
3148,939,5," not sweets& how refreshing.. they worked well and the kids loved them. Only possible negative is that they are all men! lol"
3149,939,4," great little tattoos that don't last too long& I recently bought different ones for my daughter that lasted over a week and were hard to remove& which if that's what you are looking for that's fine& but generally I'm just looking for one that will hang around a day or 2 and come off in the bath - which these do!!"
3150,939,3," i assumed they were going to arrive packaged single as they look in the picture. they have arrived as one sheet which i'm going to have to cut out as they are for party bags& so i'm a little disappointed about that. i'm sure the kids won't mind& i just hope they don't stick to anything in there& or there'll be some upset kids."
3151,940,3," Ok so the kit itself is absolutley tiny& i thought it would be the same size as my facepainting kit - how wrong i was!! The brushes are useless so i use cotton buds instead& the stencils that are words or have tiny details tear and little pieces get stuck to the skin& however the glitter is of great quality and the larger stencils work fine! Can be reused but removing previous glue and glitter is a nightmare so using same colour scheme is great.Overall it did do what it says on the tin but generally not great quality - i wanted this for my party business its safe to say ill be buying a better quality one as this will probably only last 2/3 parties"
3152,940,5," I bought these to use at children's birthday parties and once my niece saw them& she keeps asking to have the tattoos.  Very easy to use& will say that I haven't reused any of them& so not sure how good that would be& and don't use too much glue otherwise can be a bit tricky when pulling off the stencil."
3153,940,4," Very prompt and fast delivery. The tattoo kit is quite small and also the stencils are ok but need a faster kit in ways of area and appliance to kids as this will run out straight away"
3154,940,5," Every little girls and boys dream! Bought them in May& still have a few a left. If kept well they can stay on the skin for a while. My niece has very sensitive skin but found this glue and glitter ok& with no skin reaction. Cute little tub to keep everything in. Will buy more once these go."
3155,940,1," Glue was missing from the package which is definitely needed and pretty much impossible to find any safe for children in the shops. Needed for birthday party so luckly bounce4fun who was suppling castle and also glitter tattoos lent me theirs."
3156,940,5," Bought this to use at my 5yr olds birthday party. The queues of children sat waiting to have a tattoo lasted for the whole party and there are still lots left over for my daughters to use at home"
3157,940,5," i got this for my 4 year olds party she was thrilled all her friends also loved itlooked very small when it arrived but lots in itlots left and i have already used it many times"
3158,940,5," Good selection of designs and range of glitters  All conveniently stored in a plastic box.  Smaller than expected though."
3159,941,4," good"
3160,942,3," Bought this as a Christmas stocking filler for my Moshi mad daughter at the same time purchasing Ben 10 tattoos for my son. Although both items similar in price the quantity and quality of these in comparison was poor."
3161,942,1," I was expecting the tattoo transfers to be what's in the picture but its not the moshi tattoos that I recived must be series 5? But I'm not sure I know most of the moshis but I can only name one of the moshis !Carnt see the kids getting too excited about moshi tattoos when they don't even know who they are!Also they seem to be more |boyish| then unisex"
3162,942,1," I didn't expect all that much - I just wanted a bit of fun for my 6yr olds Moshi themed party& but I did expect them to stick to the children for at least until their bathtime.  Unfortunately& as soon as they were on& they started to peel off.  The kids were quite disappointed.  I wouldn't have bothered if I'd known they'd be that bad.  Very disappointing."
3163,942,5," A good variety of Moshi character tattoos& large and small. Easy to apply and lasted reasonably well (~5 days average).  Good for parties/ party bags.  Would recommend the product."
3164,942,5," Really easy and quick to apply and without mess. Lasts a long time& much to the delight of my children!A great surprise for the children at our moshi monster party."
3165,942,2," I brought these for my 6 yr old son who loves tattoos and moshi monsters but we can't get then to stick to him ! I would buy off seller again as they came before the due date !"
3166,942,5," i bought them for my daughter's moshi monster themed B'day party. Came on time and it was a huge hit wmong the girls. they stick well and are nice and bright. highly recommend."
3167,942,5," Much nicer in real life and made the perfect present for our wonderful son.  Excellent packaging and super fast delivery. Highly recommended for that extra special gift."
3168,943,5," Arrived on time and great fun for the kids. Very happy. Has screw on tops to the glitter as some i have bought dont and are easier to spill."
3169,943,5," Bought this for my 6 year old daughter who absolutely loves it.  Great quality and the stencils can be re-used which is great. Would highly recommend."
3170,943,5," The item came very quick and she was over the moon. She had already tried the product out at Xmas & so this new lot wasvery welcome. Every one in the family is now well tattooed. They seem a good buy and stay on the skin for sometime."
3171,943,5," excellent value and very easy to apply and remove.Other glitter tattoos can be hard to remove. This one comes off with soap and water or baby oil.Great fun for girls of all ages."
3172,943,5," We all had lots of fun with these. We put them in our daughters stocking (who is 3yr) and she spent most of her day giving us all glitter tattoos.... She loved it."
3173,943,5," Very good product. Endless fun.  We have used the glitter tattoos many times. Originally bought for a birthday party but have been used many times since."
3174,943,3," Bought this for a birthday present.  She was made up with it.  Every little princess loves glitter.  Packaging could be better but good value for money."
3175,943,5," Great for a shared activity.  Allows children to be creative with colours. Applications get easier with practice.  Superb birthday gift for others too."
3176,944,3," These were great for my 3 year old son's superman birthday party. Good variety of designs and sizes. Easy to put on& but they do tend to start to rub off quite quickly once applied. Worth the few pounds they cost for the look on his face when he put them on! Removal is a pain as you need surgical spirit which I had to buy especially."
3177,944,5," Also part of current superman/smallville obsession. I've worn these a few times& they of course don't last but it's cool when people comment on the superhero on the back of my leg or the iconic S on my wrist. They give me ideas for when I get a real one"
3178,944,4," it's only the two sheets& so 10 tattoos to choose from (which personally was plenty) good for a laugh however they dont lst long (yet again a bonus for me as i had work the next day :L)"
3179,944,5," Bought as a gift for my son as he is a marvel fan Cnt wait to see look on his face when he opens these. Great value for money n delivered well within estimated delivery time"
3180,944,5," These are really good temporary tattoos. It's easy to follow the instructions& and the tattoos look awesome& Man of Steel was great and so are these tattoos"
3181,944,5," great value& fun extra as a gift"
3182,945,5," Track: not much I can say& except that it does exactly what it says on the tin."
3183,945,5," Arrived undamaged and on time. Well done."
3184,945,5," Useful for displaying slot cars"
3185,945,5," Excellent value and delivery."
3186,945,4," good product"
3187,946,4," It's great but make sure you check the device compatibility. You cannot use this on a kindle fire hdx."
3188,946,5," Superb product. As advertised and promptly delivered. Many thanks."
3189,946,5," This is great fun& we have sphero 2.0 and lots of other RC toys / robots. When I say we I mean the little ones but I think I have just as much fun with Sphero as they do. It's much faster then sphero and is closer to an RC car than to Sphero 2.0. Control via your smartphone running iOS or Andriod is very responsive and the app is very good. I love how you can customise it with different tyres depending on terrain (obviously at extra cost so typical marketing) but it allows that personal touch. Build quality is excellent as with Sphero 2.0 and is very durable so can take jumps etc without breaking. Overal another great smartphone controlled toy / robot& definitely recommended!"
3190,946,5," Partner loves this it's mint"
3191,946,5," Great fun"
3192,947,5," Not all hot wheels cars will work with the different track options& but my son always found a few that will. So once you find the right cars it works fine and its a lot of fun& or so my son says.... you can link it to other hot wheels track sets as well& so the posibilities are endless..."
3193,947,4," The trouble with this is that the boosters& in all 10 track layouts&won't send the cars to the next booster. I thought it could be the batteries but I've tried the best batteries. You have to shorten the tracks if possible for it to work or else you are forever having to give the cars a push. I didn't buy it to do that. Thinking it could have been a waste of money! Up date& car what came with track doesn't work good but found 1 car the works so now the track is brilliant. Will have to find the right cars!"
3194,947,5," This product was brought as part of Christmas present & I have purchased hot wheels before and this purchase is to add to my grandson collection of this game& it was well packaged and arrived well before dare given."
3195,947,3," this item like most hot wheel tracks are just o.k.. takes a bit of setting up"
3196,947,5," great value for money! endless play time and a great size! glad i didnt spend less and get a smaller track"
3197,948,5," These were bought to add onto my son's Scalextric set& I never thought for one moment that they would improve the track this much but now the cars slide around the hairpin bend and stay on the track which is great fun."
3198,949,5," A great way to get a lot of expensive scalextric pieces in a bundle that saves money. But this is only a starter set and really adding to it over time is the way to go to keep it interesting. Digital scalextric is a massive jump in terms of playability over analogue sets and once you go digital you won't go back. The pit lane game is fine and adds a novelty factor and the cars are really quick. Lane changing works brilliantly. Enjoying new hobby with the kids. RecommendedWorth noting if you plan to crash lots and be rough generally& things like spoilers and wing mirrors won't last long. Aside from that the cars are pretty tough."
3199,949,5," I bought this set as my grandaughter has taking a liken to cars rather than dolls. She loved it and even though she's only 6 soon picked up the switching lanes and entering the pits at the right time. My only complaint as such is that you really need the lapcounter& (which I've bought)to keep track of who's winning& seeing as how you can race 4 cars with this set.(3 supplied& with 3 controllers).I have added more track and doubled the size& with the ext sets you can buy and it makes it a bit more tricky but still more fun.The standard set is good value at the current discounted price& and will keep up to 4 kids/adults happy for many an hour& my partner who doesn't normally like cars has become very competitive and can't wait to play since I bought this set. Highly rated& buy it now."
3200,949,5," Scalextrics evolved - no more single track monotony - now you can overtake your kids not just flick them off the road at the corners like our parents did.....  Seriously though it's a great product - not cheap& but it's a lot more interactive than the old kits and the cars with magnets underneath do help keep them on the road - less susceptible to sliding off unaided."
3201,949,5," Hours of fun& means more than 2 can play and means peace and quiet& as the loft is now a scalextric heaven."
3202,949,5," Excellent. Expensive but worth it. Wing-mirrors on the cars are fragile and will quickly be snapped off. I purchased the track converter so that I could use my |standard| track with the digital track"
3203,949,4," Excellent value for money! Complete set with sturdy cars& resiliant track& and some good features. The only reason it does not get 5 stars is the |digital lane change| feature seems a little unreliable! Sometimes it works& sometimes it doesn't. Not sure why."
3204,949,4," This arrived yesterday so these are immediate impressions.Plenty of goodies for your money and the cars are far better than staying on the track than the ones of years ago.The car wing mirrors ......one was missing and already the rest have started to fall off during racing tumbles.Should be fixed better.The pit stop device is unreliable as sometimes it works but often it does not.A great pity as this adds a fun element to the racing.Without a lap counter no real idea can gained as to car positions in a race .....but I purchased one with the set and am mighty glad I did.The track switching device is excellent..Looking forward to plenty of fun in the future and overall pleased with my purchase."
3205,949,5," The item that should have arrived on the 27-10-2never arrived I phoned hawkin's bazaar the replacement arrived next day excellent"
3206,950,4," Bit of advice to any potential buyers: look carefully at the connections shown in the picture...as the manufacturers want this to be compatable with both classic and sport track& you can see the fasteners are not the same on both sides.The way this connects to your track is by a |converter| piece which transforms what seems at first glance to be a half-length accessory to the size of a full length track piece.  For some sets with few or no customisable straights (a figure of eight track& for example) it can be challenging to find space for it without a big rethink.Due to restricted space I ended up having to cut/file away fastenings from a couple of mis-matching pieces and super-glue them together.So& don't make the same mistake as me.  When planning your track& allow a full track length for this accessory!"
3207,950,4," The lap counter is great for keeping tag of what is happening on the race track.The cars move so fast and if they do happen to leave the track& it is often difficult to work out who has done how many laps - not now.Not only does this accessory count down the laps (which can be set independently for each lane& therby introducing a handicap system) it also times each lap showing the fastest time for each player at the end of the race. This gives another |opponent| to beat.The set also includes a convertor straight to make it compatible with both the classic and sport track sets.Overall a great addition to any scalextric set."
3208,950,5," This piece of kit is neccessary to know who's winning& it counts down the number of laps in the form of a digital readout. It also times a lap as well.  Will fit older as well as newer tracks& has a half track to join on using the joiners that are different to your track& creating a full length with the same as your track joiners at each end.  Needs batteries though& pity it's not powered from the track."
3209,950,2," This is the second new scalextric product we've had recently and both required modification with a stanley knife before they would  work as expected. In this case& the moulded channel for the cars was not a channel at all& so the cars just got stuck. Rather than send back and disappoint my daughter& I spent 15 minutes cutting out the offending plastic so the cars could pass un-obstructed. It now works great& but surely such a basic defect should be getting picked up before getting to the customer.My second issue with Scalextric is that there is absolutely no response from their customer service email address& other than an automated acknowledgement. So if you have any problems& don't expect Scalextric to sort them out.This and other recent experiences with Scalextric have totally put us off buying any more bits from them."
3210,950,5," This is a vital piece of kit for the scalextric . Makes playing much more fun records fasstest lap times for each competitor and makes racing much more competetive ! Great fun highly recommended"
3211,950,4," Works well with the scalextric C1297 circuit. Tracks fastest lap for each car and the number of remaining laps. It does not give you the overall time for all laps completed but it is good fun. Was easy to fit on the circuit."
3212,950,5," My grandsons have had great enjoyment with their Scalextric track and using the lap counter adds to the fun - particularly when they challenge Dad to a race."
3213,950,4," Son and grandson still enjoying it with greater excitement when lap competitions are involved.especially friends coming in for fixed lap race"
3214,951,3," My son was really disappointed with this& very small and the cars fall off after the loop. He does love the fact it is mario"
3215,951,5," my grandson is a mario fan and it was  part of his birthay present. he just loves it except when dad wins"
3216,951,5," Excellent product. Great seller."
3217,952,5," I bought this for my son's first Birthday and both he and his almost three year old cousin loved playing with it. My son is pretty quick to pick things up and had the little cars going down the track in no time at all (I admit I rather hoped he'd spend a little more time occupied in trying to work it out but never mind!). I would advise caution when giving this to younger children because the cars are rather small and the track is very light and easy to lift& so supervision would be required for smaller toddlers to avoid swallowing and head-bashing. I think this is a toy he will not tire of playing with and it's superb value for money& so I can't recommend it enough for a toddler who enjoys motion and colour."
3218,952,1," If I could give this no stars I would. This was purchased for my 5 year old son who has special needs. Although the item arrived promptly and in one piece it was apparent that it is very poorly constructed and feels cheap. To make matters worse& of the four 'cars' that go down the track only two are now working. The two that have broken have both broke in exactly the same way. The metal end caps on the axles have come off meaning that the the small wheels have come off and also the axle that goes through the car has come out. The wheels and end caps are obviously a choking hazard and the axle is sharp. Very very poor quality& would not recommend. Spend your money on something else& this item is unsafe."
3219,952,5," Bought this for my sons birthday and he loved it. I like the fact that it is wood and looks slightly old fashioned. Its brilliant. hours of fun."
3220,952,5," We really like the design of this racetrack.  Our children& 1 year old daughter and 3 year old son& both enjoy playing with it.  The cars are placed at the top of the track and flip over at the end of each ramp before running off the bottom ramp.  Our son already has another of this type of racetrack and it is worth noting that the cars are not compatible"
3221,952,4," Sturdy construction& colourful& cars run smoothly and my son loves playing with this. The cars are kind of small so I have to oversee him playing with them and discourage him from trying to put them in his mouth but otherwise he has a whale of a time watching the cars slide down the track."
3222,952,4," Perfect for doing what it says on the tin& my local children's centre has one like it and I couldn't get my lo off it. He is 18 months and really enjoys sending cars down it. I would say that the aging is confused on the website and packaging& it say 36 on the box but I wouldn't worry about that unless your child still puts toys in his mouth as the cars are small."
3223,952,2," It's very small but that's not a huge problem& the quality isn't of the best standard& looks very quickly painted on cheap wood& not overly satisfied for the price! Delivery was prompt."
3224,952,4," Strangely hypnotic to watch the supplied cars rock themselves down the track to the bottom to be ejected at velocity onto the living room floor...This toy is durable& nicely painted and should have lasting appeal!My only criticism would be that the track itself is not particularly long& but this is really a minor point."
3225,953,1," I bought these recently. I thought I would be sent track supports as shown in the picture but was sent a few round pieces of plastic that might support track but certainly doesn't resemble the picture shown. I assume that the seller relies on the hastle factor of returning the disapointing articles. The picture is very misleading and I would not recommend that you pay over 5 pounds for a few plastic discs that stack up. You would be better off using lego."
3226,953,4," These are exactly as shown in the photo. They're customisable& you can split the grey bits into individual discs and remove the black cross shaped bits as shown in the photo. The black part fits into circular holes on the bottom of the scalextric track and provides a useful and fairly sturdy support for the elevated sections. You will also need either the separate C8295 Elevated track piece& or extra packs of these track supports& to make a full bridge over another piece of scalextric track."
3227,953,5," Great extra for sons scalextric set"
3228,954,5," Perfect thanks"
3229,955,5," Excellent value for money and my 4 year old son absolutely loves it."
3230,955,5," I bought this as a Christmas presentfor my 2 1/2 yr old son and he loves it. He plays with it constantly and loves the cars.The only downside was you have to be creative and patient when it comes to putting it together because the manual wasn't reliable. When we tried to follow it& it looked as though there were parts missing and in the end& we had to refer to a customer photo to complete and it was well worth it just to see the excitement on his face because he is a huge Ligthing McQueen fan."
3231,955,5," I bought this for my 3 year old 'Cars'super fan for Christmas. Worth every penny!!!! He can easily spend an hour playing on his own with the cars& and the set looks fab& sturdy and not too difficult to build! Excellent!"
3232,955,4," Bought this as a Christmas present for my 3 year old son. It keeps him entertained for ages he loves it however it would be better if the track didn't keep coming apart as its a pain to put together."
3233,955,5," This Absolulty a brilliant buy for any cars fans. It is very big so no good if you have small rooms."
3234,955,4," Very pleased with the sturdiness of this play table& rather larger than I thought& even though I did check measurements - hopefully my 2year old grandson will not pull it apart as took me 3hrs to put together. Bit disappointed that some of the track doesn't fit together perfectly but I noted another review said they'd used blutack  Well worth the money"
3235,955,4," Good value for money and my son has played with it non stop but very tricky to build"
3236,955,5," It took like 3 hourS to assemble this however my 3 year old absolutely loves this"
3237,956,5," This track was just what my son needed to finish of his track which is made of several kits.  Its original kit& fits perfectly and worth the money."
3238,956,4," It does exactly what is says it does. Helps fill in spaces in large& complicated track layouts to avoid bending/frustration"
3239,956,5," arrived in few days and fits the gap"
3240,957,4," Some thing that is ideal for the very young and now no one seems to stock additional track"
3241,957,5," fits the purpose quite nicely&& extends the childs track to cover most of the available floor space and keeps the dog in the kitchen"
3242,958,5," Well loved by my grandson"
3243,959,5," I'm kind of tired of all the Hot Wheels stuff that takes batteries and just seems to be excuses for creating mid-air collisions.  I like this because it's like the gravity-driven fun of yesteryear.  The jump is great& and my 5-year-old loves it."
3244,959,2," Very expensive for what you get. Flimsy track& a couple of cars and the jump .Quite honestly it should be priced at around Â£15&given how much it cost it was a pretty embarrassing present& even for a four year old! Not all what I remembered from when my son had something similar nearly forty years ago."
3245,959,5," Does what it says on the tin."
3246,960,5," My son loves this silage he also has the corn as well and spends hours loading it& spreading it& buck raking it etc much better than the lawn mower clippings he used to bring in.  It does get everywhere sometimes but is easily hoovered up."
3247,960,5," One happy little four year old& it is what it is! Will be buying from them again! Thank you x"
3248,960,4," excellent value for money"
3249,960,5," Great quality"
3250,961,5," My mum got this for my son's Christmas present this year and I am so impressed with the quality.  We have a wooden floor and the back is non slip so it stays put& my son has spilt juice onto it and none soaked through or into the mat.  I just wiped clean with a towel and it left no stains...blackcurrant too!  It doesn't roll up at the ends and we roll it away everynight to go under the sofa...the next day it roll's back flat onto the floor!Lot's of great detail& I'm sure my son will have many years enjoyement from this!"
3251,961,5," My 3year old loves this as he plays with cars all the time& we just leave it down all the time in their play room and hoover it."
3252,961,5," Some customers criticised this toy mat as being flimsy and suffering from wear and tear at an early stage. However& I purchased one and it has proved to be one of the best buys I have made for our two year old grandson. Look after this 'mat' do not try to hoover it& eat off it& sleep under it or use it for a 'camp'& bathmat and if unsupervised children want to fight with it or use it to slide down the stairs on& they will probably destroy it. We roll ours up around a cardboard tube when put away& not folded up& the tube keeps it looking like new. With this mat& which has a non-slip rubber backing& there are endless scenarios for the coloured printed images on the topside as you would find in any town or city. Our grandson insists we get the 'mat' out each time he visits us and as yet& after nearly six months has not tired of playing with it. Get some cars& a little train and maybe a matchbox helicopter. Also the sets of wooden cars/buses/fire engines etc. which we also purchased (London Set) under the 'Le Toy' name& add to the fun. The wooden vehicles are well made and run freely. I can honestly say these products are very good and I recommend them to any small child and parents& with active imaginations. Look after these products and they will last!"
3253,961,1," As previous reviewers have said& this playmat is rubbish! Looks lovely when you first get it out but after just a few months light use it now looks terrible. It is covered in horrible matted bobbly bits and just looks grey and depressing. It just doesn't seem to clean up at all& hoovering makes no difference. Other reviewers have said you just need to look after it better& but this is a child's car playmat and should be able to withstand children playing on it with cars! May be fine at a grandparents house with occasional use& but if you want anything that lasts longer than a couple of months (which at this price& you do) then don't bother with this one. My daughter's pre-school have the same mat and it looks equally awful& while their cheap B"
3254,961,1," I didn't listen to the other reviews and bought this mat all the same for my 2 year old this Christmas. We didn't even get to the New Year without bobbles. Iit looks awful after only three weeks and is a total waste of money. What a shame. Please don't be tempted like I was."
3255,961,1," What a shame& the picture on this is lovely& very tasteful colours (unlike some other gaudy ones) which look very realistic& and the detail on the picture is beautiful. My son was very pleased with it and played a lot. Then after about 2 months it started to go bobbly& and now I have thrown it out as it is useless& the bobbles are so long they get caught in the car wheels! I tried to de-bobble it with one of those machines but the fibres are too strong to be shaved off."
3256,961,5," Great for my 3 yr old boy& who loves cars. Lots of roads to drive on and car wash& garage and extra things do stop and do with the cars. Suitable for |ordinary size| cars."
3257,961,1," Don't get this& I read the reviews and more people said it was great than others who said it bobbled...well ours bobbled& going to have to buy some sort of bobble brush and keep brushing it until I tear a hole through it??. I paid Â£30 for this as a Christmas present and it bobbled after 2 days& not impressed. I agree that its a great design but only when you can see through the bobbling..."
3258,962,4," Perfect for track maintenance !"
3259,963,1," I would be interested to see if this review is published as this item (Robo Sapien X) is the shoddiest item I have ever bought from Amazon. I have taken delivery of two of these and have yet to be sent one that actually works let alone perform all the marvellous tricks it's supposed to do.  I am no space scientist but I have an engineering background and would consider myself generally competent.  I lost the first hour gingerly unpacking the robot& digesting the manual and double-checking while the robot blinked aimlessly but did nothing else.  After another hour spent changing the batteries and checking online for meaningful advice I contacted Amazon and arranged a replacement.  As you can guess& this involved repackaging the toy and trailing down to the Post Office.  After a week I received a replacement which lo and behold was completely lifeless.There is nothing to suggest this toy has been subject to any form of testing or quality control.  I refuse to believe that this experience is unique to me and that the sellers are unaware of the problems.  Do not reply to me asking if I have used reputable/fresh batteries and are they in the right way round.This item should work OUT OF THE BOX FIRST TIME.  Unless you have time and money to waste think again before buying this item."
3260,963,2," The robot works ok with its remote. but the IOS 8 plug in for use with the I pad  does not work ( tried new batteries even though brand new)  Also tried to contact the WowWee helpline who were worse than useless (typical USA mentality)  so both myself and my grandson extremely  disappointed If sensible help were available it would at least my help to resolve the problem"
3261,963,3," Looks the part but not as 'technical' as I'd hoped. You can purchase this at Smyths a lot cheaper."
3262,963,4," Due to the difficulty getting the item out of it's packaging ( it took 1 hour ) I give it four stars and would not buy another . Once out it was easy to set up and the manual good it performed very well and the size is good."
3263,964,5,""
3264,964,4," Scalextric - the quintessentially British toy that every schoolboy wanted when I was a child.Is it still relevant in the digital age?This particular set certainly brings a few updates to the last time I played with a Scalextrix set.  The cars are digitally chipped& which means that they are paired to their individual controller so that a track with only two |lanes| can have four cars racing on it.It also means that you can have more than one car in each lane and that lane changing and even braking is now possible.This set is a really good starter set.  The track layout is quite large with the track taking up 2.5m x 1.35m and has a total of 6.3m of track.  This is about as big as I can fit in my living room!  It can also be set out in several different shapes.Set up seemed easier than previously too.  The track still has to slot together& but the clips seem to have been simplified.  The cars are simple to link to their respective controllers& so you will be racing in no time.The cars also seem to be able to stay on the track at higher speeds than I remember too! The magnatraction system they now use certainly seems to work well.The cars themselves look better than ever too.  The Bugatti Veyron in particular looks great.There are a huge amount of extras and accessories that you can get to go with your track including digital lap timers and counter.I really do think that this would be a fantastic gift for any lucky child.I had a huge amount of fun setting this up and playing with it.Please take a look at the little video I made to go with this review - I hope you enjoy watching it."
3265,964,5," My six year old son loves this Scalextric set.  However& within just a few days the wing mirror had broken off the yellow car.  There seems to be quite a difference in the speed of the two cars too& the blue one being much slower.  Needless to say& there are arguments all the time about who has which car !  Remember too that this is a DIGITAL set and therefore needs cars which are digital ready or can be upgraded by adding a digital plug."
3266,964,4," Last Christmas purchased Micro Scalextric and was useless.  Cars would stop all the time.  This is a far superior product and is worth the extra expense."
3267,964,5," Been looking for a set to get me started and this is a really good set. Plenty of track pieces and two of the overtaking straights which means you can add two extra cars on and race with four. It's really straight forward to get set up and get racing. Shame there's no lap counter but a really good platform to start building on!"
3268,964,5," Aimed at ages 7+& this is a fast moving& traditional Scalextric set. The set gives you a nice& basic track (totally agree with a previous reviewer& they are a bit fiddly to construct& but they do stay together well)& two cars and two controllers. You can extend this set& both with extra track and with extra cars â€“ in fact& you can race up to four at a time. However& obviously& this will involve extra cost and this is a fairly large set already and makes an excellent introduction to racing for children who are old enough to control the cars as they take the corners and race the twists and turns of the track.This was a big hit with the men in my house â€“both my sons enjoyed racing the cars and even my husband got involved â€“ so it certainly has a wide age appeal. The cars do sometimes fly off the track if you go too fast and my ten year old took a little while to get used to the controls. Under 7â€™s might find the cars difficult to control& but it is great fun for older children. It is difficult to find toys which hold childrenâ€™s attention and take them away from their games consoles& but this may well be one which the whole family can enjoy& as well as being good value for money as it give you the ability to change and extend the set to make it more difficult/interesting if you want."
3269,965,4," For 9.99 I was hoping that these would be fairly decent quality and I wasnt disappointed. Bought for my 2.5 year old son& he loves them. They're pretty indestructable by his standards. Play on the table& on the floor& they go quite fast and do wheelies etc. Only downside is that they are quite small so quite often end up under the sofa. The supplied ramps are quite small too but all in all& a good xmas pressie for my boy and everyone had a go on them at Christmas."
3270,966,4," I was a bit doubtful about this as anything that involves jumping the cars is never going to work perfectly all the time. However& we knew our son wanted it& so duly obliged. It is actually quite good fun& though it does take a bit of care to get it working right - too slow& and the car doesn't make it"
3271,966,3," I bought this for my son's birthday as it says on the front of the box in big letters |Suitable to extend any Scalextric set| - imagine his disappointment on his birthday when he opened it and it wouldn't work with the Scalextric Start set he'd received for Christmas just a few weeks earlier. What it should say is |Suitable to extend any Scalextric set as long as you buy the separate bits of connector track that you need to make it work with Start sets|.Works fine once you have the connectors."
3272,966,3," I bought this item for my grandson who is aged 4.  Thoroughly enjoyed it when grandad didn't take over. Very easy to put together and once got the hang of it played for ages without cars spinning off the track.It does what it says on the box."
3273,966,4," A bit fiddly to put together but great fun once landing distance worked out. Bought for 5 year old but cousins up to 14 enjoyed it too. Requires some skill to control speed which I liked."
3274,966,5," This is a great little extension set adding a bit more depth to what you can do with the cars and adding more fun into the race dynamic when my nephew gets a bit older i'm going to look into upgrading the track to digital"
3275,966,4," A good product and super fast delivery however this will only connect to Scalextric Start if you have or purchase the right connectors. Good customer service thank you"
3276,966,4," This accessory provides additional interest to just running cars around on the level. Care is needed to correctly align the clip on pieces for best performance."
3277,966,5," Works well& cars come of track sometimes but adds different dimension to scalextric"
3278,967,1," I bought this based on its good review& BUT& its quality is very disappointing. Made from very thin plastic and the two flaps on both sides keep falling off& won't click on properly. Tried so many times trying to put them back on & at the end I have to give it up.It just doesn't work! And the toy cars are very poor quality too& even those a few quids for 5 from tesco are much better quality compared to these.  Not worth the money at all. Won't trust 5 star review anymore."
3279,967,5," Item arrived promptly quicker than expected so very happy. This item was bought as a gift for my 6yr old son and I think he will be really pleased with it. Item looks of good quality and with better quality cars than some I have looked at the cars looked cheap."
3280,967,5," Item arrived early and well packed.Bought for my grandson for Christmas He is car mad so with added transporter I know he will be over the moon.Looks good quality and not a bad price either Well pleased"
3281,967,1," I totally agree with the previous review. Thin plastic doors keep falling off& poorly made toy. My son was very disappointed to find out that his birthday present would have to be returned."
3282,968,3," I pretty much got what I paid for plastic a bit cheap and probably wont last very long but was not expensive so can't ask for much more"
3283,968,4," Bought as a birthday present for my nephew and he loved it !Would be happy to use this seller again."
3284,968,5," Great product however short lived fun& put away a couple of weeks then bring out again."
3285,968,5," Fab"
3286,969,4," Scalectric is good quality& but expensive.  It is a shame that the controllers are not wireless& but other than that they work well with a good response and feel."
3287,969,4," Do exactly as it says on the box.  Have had no issues with them.  However& only 4 stars for the product as I just think scalextric needs to look at the quality feel of these controllers.  They are light and cheap and the paint job over the injection moulded plastic also looks cheap.  Changing the colour caps usually results in snapping one of the 4 retaining pins off but this doesn't affect them staying in place."
3288,969,5," very good product& it meant there were no more arguments over the few we had. we would purchase these again"
3289,969,3," Got this from Jadlam. Just realised& when writing this review that I never received the |including 5 x Colour clips|. Apart from that the throttle itself works as advertised."
3290,969,5," Excellent for enabling more than two to play with the new digital sets"
3291,969,4," When I got it out of the bag& I wasn't impressed with the build quality. It was a real throw back to the type of manufacturing that we had in the 1970's. That all said& it continues to work well& so maybe appearances are deceptive"
3292,970,4," I bought this for my grandson ( and his Daddy!) as an addition to the first track and cars for his birthday. They haven't set it up yet& because it needs extra track. This is unfortunate& I should have checked& but assumed it was ready to go. Perhaps& it should be clearer for those of us who are 'L' scaletrics.... Having said this& it looks good and i hope to give it a whril soon."
3293,970,4," Fun addition to your digital track& worth while getting pit lane track& to make this a worthwhile buy."
3294,970,3," It looks great but it would have been helpful to know you need a right and left pit lane to use it. More information before purchase would have been useful."
3295,970,4," Great fun - would have got 5 stars if the light display could be rotated for better vision when playing"
3296,971,5," This was a present for my grandson and I chose it after reading the reviews from other purchasers of this product.  He wrote me a charming thank you letter& so I think he is very pleased with it!"
3297,971,5," gives some variation on corners from the R2 curves .fun to mix 1 or 2 of theese into a |standard| corner/bend for a more engaging track layout"
3298,972,3," I bought these in error so did not do what I expected.However the design of them is to attach two sections of track together as we did in pre digital days for 4 or 6 lane tracks.I found knocking the pins in a real pain as you need to use a narrow punch to go between the flanges of the clip. Gets tricky leaning over a large layout doing this."
3299,972,5," brill"
3300,973,3," Great idea to add to a hot wheels track& my boy spends lots of time analysing the car times ( not sure how accurate they are!) a bit pricey& so only three stars& keep an eye out in home bargains as I've seen this for Â£5!"
3301,973,5," Whooooosh! Kids love this! And great for working on number recognition and place value in maths. Great for practising recording and comparing& more/less. Can get loads of fun maths activities out of this all while the kids are actually enjoying themselves! It's one of my kids favourite pieces of hot wheels."
3302,973,5," Great product. My sons aged 5 and 7 have had lots of fun with this. Great addition to any hot wheels set."
3303,973,5," delivered promply and item was as advertised. Very pleased"
3304,973,5," grandson was as pleased as punch!"
3305,974,4," I ORDERED THIS ITEM FOR MY SISTERINLAWS PARTNER FOR CHRISTMAS TO GO WITH HIS SCALEXTRIC SET ITS PERFECT TO ADD TO THE ITEMS HE ALREADY HAS IT IS OF GOOD QUALITY WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE"
3306,975,5," Fun& Fun& Fun& from the word go! Sturdy& |does what it says on the packet| resulting in laughter and pleasure for all. good value. Well packed."
3307,975,5," Great because you can turn the music on and OFF while still playing with it... easy for even a dextrous almost 3 year old"
3308,975,5," Great product which my 6 year old son and his friends love. Very good value for money and prompt hassle free delivery. Particularly pleased with the fact that it has an off button for the extremely loud music but you can still operate the car on silent and you can recharge it when it runs out of steam. All round good buy which I'd recommend for boys and girls alike."
3309,975,5," Bought as a gift for my youngest Grandson who loves it"
3310,975,5," great product& great postage etc. very pleased with this"
3311,975,3," Got these instead of the more expensive Hamleys ones as kids wanted one each for Xmas. Looks a bit cheaper on bodywork but few days in going fine and kids love them. Hope they last! Thank goodness you can turn the music off!"
3312,975,3," Not a bad toy& the music is incredibly annoying though. Bit of a shame that I was advised to not buy 2. They can't be played in the same room due to them being on the same channel. Some unhappy girls at Christmas time."
3313,976,5," A great addition to the original set  but take care when assembling some of the joinings may break off without warning"
3314,976,5," perfect addition& my grandson loves all the bends and corners we now have& need different cars now just for a change."
3315,977,2," Clips together easily and joins up with standard track. Note that it is a 3/4 length straight so you will almost certainly need some shorter straights to match it up. One major disappointment is that no additional track supports are supplied to slope the approach track up to the bridge& hence a bit of a rip of for the price.One comment regarding the seller jaldamracingmodels& this was delivered without the original box and hence was useless to give as a birthday present. I have had issues with this seller previously on ebay. You have been warned!"
3316,977,3," Well packaged and easy to build& positioning and sizing of the track supports requires a little more effort. The bridge will not accomodate the James Bond Range Rover (the bridge is too low)& my other cars seem fine though."
3317,977,5," This product is exactly what was needed to enhance our expanding layout&very well made good quality&delivered on time&in good condition and well protected with good packaging& thankyou"
3318,977,5," Well I'm building a huge track for my nephews decided to get this to make building the crossover easier"
3319,977,5," great piece of kit but you need other pieces to make it fit"
3320,978,5," snelle verzending& in goede staat product ontvangen."
3321,979,4," I actually thought this was gona be rubbish but it actually works fine and is quite sturdy& shoots out cars really good."
3322,979,5," Was very happy with this item& delivery was quick"
3323,979,5," As described& fast delivery& great to add to any Hot Wheels tracks"
3324,979,4," Really simple yet extremely entertaining toy! Extremely pleased with this purchase and would recommend."
3325,979,5," My granson loves this is no problem in recommending this as an add on to the original hot wheels kit"
3326,979,5," Very easy to put together and use."
3327,979,4," Works with flat hotwheels track.."
3328,980,4," Just perfect for my Grandsons who have so many toys already. They love playing with this when they are in fast car mode. I feel that buying bigger version of this would have been a waste of money. The thrill for them is served very well with this version."
3329,980,3," 3/5 because you have to keep turning that key which for young children means daddy has to sit there and do it"
3330,980,4," Bit flimsy but I works and my 3 year old son likes it"
3331,980,5," My Grandson& ("
3332,981,2," Advertised for Micro Scalextric but strips were too big and we needed to cut them down to size. Were still not a good fit."
3333,981,1," i orded on 23rd as it said it will delivered before 27th or by the 27th. when i told them it had not turn up as i have 3year old boy waiting. his reply was sorry wait until the 6th of next month& and then let us know if you not got it. i replied and said i have a little boy who can't use his cars. and i said you need to make it clear its going to be later then the dates you said. his reply was we send it out on the day of payment so its down to the post office. i'm mad with is poor services skills they got the money and they don't give a monkeys you have to wait. i went with this company because it was going to be fast delivery for my boy. i go somewhere els next time.

3351,984,5," The four carded cars this year from Micro Scalextric have been something of an experiment. If they sell well& proving to MS that they have customer interest beyond the usual sets& then there is a good chance there will be more in the future. So& if you are on the fence a little bear that in mind. For a tenner. clichÃ© or not& you really cannot go wrong here.Over at the group I race with - google 'eahorc.com' to check us out - we have been working with MS steadily over the years& trying to get them to take the 1/64th line more seriously. The smaller scale has major advantages over the more traditional 1/32nd fare& costing much less and needing much less space to set up as a permanent track (on a board behind a sofa for example).What holds it back it that people - from parents and grandparents looking for presents that are not video games to racers such as myself - are not as aware of 1/64th as they are of the bigger& much more expensive stuff. Carded cars for a tenner are a good move. Coupled with the cars being bright and fast& they are a real winner.Bear in mind slot cars and slot car track need maintenance. At eahorc we stand ready to advise parents and other buyers how to get the most from what they buy in the 1/6th scale. Drop us a line anytime.Merry Christmas."
3352,984,4," This car works really well with our existing micro track and is a nice addition to our 1:64 fleet.  It's nicely detailed and well printed and hasn't got any bits to break off.  It comes with spare contacts and is fairly well made.  We have found it to be as fast as the cars that we got with our set - it's nice to be able to ring the changes.  Recommended if you want to add more cars to your set."
3353,984,4," I could not tell you if this car is a true to the life size version& but I think it's really nicely made. The decorations on it are nicely done. It fits my son's micro scalextrics course well.I like the extra connector wires which are really handy. Their very easy to change.Being able to purchase extra cars keeps it fresh so I really like this."
3354,984,4," My godson loves his micro scalextrix and is thrilled with this car. It is the British when it races due to the Union Jack livery of course. Nice size for 5 year old hands. Stays on the track well. I see that one reviewer has had a problem with the product but so far so good for us. Will update if it goes kaput."
3355,984,4," The car comes already decorated so no messing around with fiddly stickers and is black with a design of a British flag and Bulldog.  It comes with spare pick-ups/threads and appears very sturdy as there don't seem to be any parts that will break off which is good with it being for a micro track and a younger racer as it should take some bashes and indeed already has. A really good standard 1:64 scale car with a brilliant British theme design."
3356,984,1," It looked great and worked with the track but stopped working after 10 mins& should have sent it back but it's sitting on the side waiting for me to drive to the post office."
3357,984,5," Designed for younger racers& this Micro Scalextric car will run on any 1:64 scale track.The car is ready to go out of the packet and has good& clear contacts to help it go around the track.  The artwork is distinctive and allows the car to stand out among your collection.These cars are great to add to your collection and should have the same speed and power as the standard cars that come with the sets& making it a fair fight if you replace one."
3358,984,5," The car looks good and performs exactly as I would expect it to. Note& it isn't for the normal size track sets& but it is for the 1:64 size. These cars seem to be just perfect for the younger scalextric players and my daughter loves playing with them. This car is a great addition to a growing collection& and my daughter is very pleased with it."
3359,985,5," My son loves this. Box a little damaged but toy in mint condition. Fast delivery too& a little over a week for standard delivery. Well made and robust."
3360,986,5," The little man loves these and they go a little slower so they are easier for him to keep on the trak"
3361,987,5," Great little car &grandson loves it"
3362,988,5," Hold the track really well"
3363,988,5," Awesome car!"
3364,989,4," looking forward to building it"
3365,990,5," Darda cars and tracks are simply great fun.  Definitely not |children only|.Incredibly fast and agile.  And the special offer on this Mercedes SLS was superb value.I grabbed four: a couple will get custom paint jobs."
3366,990,4," it will be Christmas gift but it seems perfect and I'm sure it will be well accepted.Together with the racing circuit."
3367,991,5," This was bought for my son as a present. He was really pleased with it and said it has good detail ."
3368,992,5," Fifty something hobby"
3369,993,5," Excellent car racing model set from Hornby& I generally think of Hornby more as the train sets and towns to scale models but this is likely to appeal to anyone interested in a race track for that purpose or who is interested in racing as a table top gaming pursuit.This is an easy to assemble out of the box set& the box itself contains a cardboard inlaid mold which makes packing and unpacking the track& cars& twin controller and plug and lead less difficult& and easy to follow instructions are included. There are three inlay cards& one with illustrated descriptions of the track pieces included in the set& one with instructions of track& car and controller maintenance and finally instructions for control.When assembling the track for the first time it is a good idea to set all the pieces out as illustrated as some pieces of track are already attached in the box and appear like other pieces of track featured in the illustration (I think its a D and E part of track is similar to an F or something like that).The controllers worked fine for me but there is a means to adjust them for control and speed for new users& maybe younger users& with a simple adjustment by screwdriver.There is a lap counter included as part of the track (approaching this at the wrong speed will stop the car though& three is only one other part of the track& a semi-circular feature which requires checking speed).The controllers and plug connectors are simple and straightforward but the lead to the plug seemed short to me and I needed an extension lead and plug when racing.Read more â€º"
3370,993,5," This is an excellent 1:64 scale track set which is one of the best sets that we have. The set advises it is for four years and over and with the hairpin bend it is definitely a track for the older racer. You do need to judge the bend and slow down for it and especially if you are in the tighter bend track (on the inside of the bend but outside of the track the rest of the way around) and quite a few times we have taken the bend too fast and the cars come off but thankfully the cars appear to be very solidly built and so far after several times shooting off the track they both still work perfectly. As the set is a micro scalextric set it is intended for the younger racer and if you are planning on getting this as a beginners scalextric set for a young child then you may wish to look at a different set as there is a skill level involved with this track that our young son cannot yet manage and so I would say this was definitely a track for the older racer.The set comes with the following:-2 Cars (one is black and the other white and both have excellent decoration on them and attention to detail - these are my husbands favourite ): scale cars that we have)1 Transformer/Plug2 Hand Controllers1 x Power Base Track Piece1 x Short Straight Track Piece1 x Long Straight Track Piece2 x Medium Straight Track Pieces6 x Long Curved Track Pieces2 x Short Curved Track Pieces1 x Lap Counter Track Piece1 x Hairpin Bend Piece2 x Track Supports/Bridge Pieces1 x Spare Parts Pack (This includes 4 new pick-ups/braids/threads and 2 new guide blade plates)There are 15 pieces of track including the power base and all of the track pieces are fully interchangeable with other scalextric 1:64 track sets.Read more â€º"
3371,993,5," It has been a long time since I have used any Scalextric so I was actually quite excited to get my hands on this.First off the micro range is for younger racers and is designed to be a gateway into the scalextric world.The set itself was very easy to set and sports a number of good features to make it a touch easier for youngsters.The cars are extremely well detailed which is nice and are built a bit tougher to withstand the vigourâ€™s of being used by youngsters.  The magnets are extra strong too to help keep them on the track.The circuit was easy to assemble and features just over 4 metres of track.  Thereâ€™s plenty of bends and turns to keep things interesting and the cars have been designed to allow drifting and 360 spins to keep it exciting.  Thereâ€™s also a lap counter for keeping tally.The whole set is rather easy to setup and take down on a whim and makes it far more accessible as a result.This is a fantastic set and a great introduction to Scalextric.  Even if it doesnâ€™t develop into a full blown hobby& or you simply donâ€™t have the space& then itâ€™s ideal for picking up and putting down as needed for rainy day entertainment."
3372,993,4," I found this initially harder to fix together than the larger Scalextric kits - the track pieces are rather stiff an unyielding& and when adding the next section of track it's very easy to accidentally disconnect the previous one. I was also a little concerned when first switching it on that it didn't appear to work. However& a little fiddling with the track connections and the car contacts& and everything ran fine. In operation& it's a lot easier to keep the cars on-track than with the larger sets - I actually had the car going around the track 3 or 4 times at maximum speed& without decelerating& before it came off. This makes it a bit less of a challenge& but also means it would be suitable for younger kids who are unable to control cars on the bigger set."
3373,994,5," Gorgeous little scale model slot car& superb detail and goes fast whilst sticking nicely to the track around even the tightest chicane section. I love it"
3374,994,5," Fantastic car my grandson thinks its awesome"
3375,995,5," really quick service and great toy"
3376,995,5," Fab"
3377,996,4," Cars kept falling off the track initially because of the guide under the car wasn't deep enough. took them to a specialist store who rectified the issue. Build quality though was really good and detail was excellent."
3378,996,5," +I yhink my crandson will love this car for his scalectric game over the holiday."
3379,996,5," Fast and fun& a great gift& thanks ðŸ˜Žâœ”"
3380,997,5," Excellent Thank you"
3381,998,4," Supplier delivered on time and exactly as requested.Connectors are of a good quality and therfore recommended."
3382,999,5," Another brilliant car. It is time to give my only gripe& which is why don't you let us choose what& if any decoration goes on your cars. Give us a sheet of decals to stick on &if we wish. Personally &I  think some of your cars are ruined by the hideous decoration. Beware! You won't get 5 stars if you continue to do these horrid decorations."
3383,1000,5," Great fun."
3384,1000,5," really rapid delivery when I mentioned it was for my grandsons birthday. Excellent gift& he's delighted with all the things it does& exciting in the extreme!"
3385,1001,4," I bought this car upon hearing the news that is was going to be discontinued (not sure if it was or not though). When I tested this car& I was amazed at the speed of it down the straight but when you get to a corner it is awfully hard to keep it from not sliding&which does look cool& but isn't good for your lap time. If you are a real scalextric enthusiast then you could add a stronger magnet. One other thing& this car is slightly smaller than the other cars in my collection but overall a fantastic little car."
3386,1002,5," Excellent product. Great seller."
3387,1002,4," Expensive but sturdy"
3388,1003,5," Bought for my grandson who loves playing with it.A well made loved toy."
3389,1003,5," Great looking toy -very pleased with coÅ‚our"
3390,1004,5," As described"
3391,1005,5," Very Pleased / Many Thanks .........."
3392,1006,3," Annoyingly you only get one guide but multiple plates. I need one blade and wanted another as a spare but would have had to order 2 packs and would have ended up with more plates than I need."
3393,1006,4," Good price and delivery and otherwise hard to get hold off easily."
3394,1006,5," Just the job - good delivery"
3395,1006,5," My grandson can now play with the scalextrix"
3396,1007,4," this pack was for my 11 year old son who loves the olympics&this was perfect for his collection on london 2012"
3397,1008,5," Very nice looking car with lots of detail."
3398,1008,5," Excellent Thank you"
3399,1009,5," Great looking car& the detail is superb. Haven't got to use it on the track yet as it's for my father for Christmas. But I doubt it will ever be used as it's such a lovely piece and would be a shame to damage it especially considering the wing which I would imagine wouldn't be the most sturdy piece of the car."
3400,1009,5," Very nicely made& scalextric's attention to detail proving to be excellent as usual. A nice addition to anyone's slot car collection. I bought it on Black Friday so the price was good too"
3401,1009,5," I was given this car for cristmas and have fond it to be exceptionally good. Its highly detailed and is brilliantly fast."
3402,1010,5," The best thing with this Chip |A| is its size. It is very small and will fit in most cars. I went for this over the saloon Chip as it was cheaper there is no difference except the size. I fitted it to a Gotham City Police car which proved slightly more difficult as I had to allow for the wiring to the flashing red lights. It all worked great first time. The Chip is very durable even with my lack of care."
3403,1010,5," Well packaged. Clear instructions - although the instructions were obviously meant to cover ONLY the formula 1-style cars& with the narrow bodies& whereas I'd bought this for a saloon-bodied car (since I couldn't find anyone selling a C7006 at the time). I had to use a bit of lateral thinking when deciding where to mount it and cut some of the wires to length before soldering. YOU DO HAVE TO BE COMPETENT using a soldering iron to make use of this product. I was VERY pleased when& after the conversion& I put the car on the track and it ran perfectly from the first pull of the throttle!"
3404,1010,5," It's a little fiddly to install& but I'd never done soldering before and bought a 25w soldering iron and some solder and managed it fine. The car runs perfectly. I'm going to order another so I can convert another car!"
3405,1010,5," it is a must for old analogue cars to run on new digital tracks. it is good to the oldies back on the track.this chip is mainly for cars older than 2001  i think and it will require some skill in installing"
3406,1010,4," Nothing particularly wrong with this.  I've fitted several.  They can be fiddly depending on the car."
3407,1011,5," All Excellent!"
3408,1012,3," Disappointing. This 1:32 slot car lacks almost any detail making it a rather poor plastic model. Most of the paint detail on the car come in the form of a sheet of stickers which have to be attached at home. Iâ€™m not sure why Scalextric donâ€™t do this themselves as some are pretty fiddly to fix to the car - and without the aid of pictures with the exception of those on the box itâ€™s not clear where most of them go.More importantly& the Amazon description is incorrect. This car is not Digital Plug Ready. Part of the confusion may arise as Scalextric have a â€˜Car Features Icon Guideâ€™ on the side of the box which lists many features which can come with a Scalextric car - including DPR& working front lights& working rear lights etc. This does not mean this model comes with those. To establish that you have to look as the icons displayed on the front of the box.In use the car& as the â€˜lightningâ€™ moniker suggests& is fast. Largely thatâ€™s because itâ€™s very light indeed. As a result it leaves the track with ease.Overall not one of Scalextric best efforts. Three starsâ€¦just."
3409,1012,5," This Scalextric GT car is an additional car to use on most 1:32 scale tracks.  I've tested it on the Mini Challenge Race Set where it dwarfs the minis that come with the set.The car arrived in a nice looking box& though the card insert that the car was attached to was very difficult to remove from the box.  The contents include the car& a sticker sheet& instructions and warnings sheet and a pair of spare contacts& which is a standard these days for Scalextric cars.The first thing to note is that the car in the picture has all its stickers on. The one you get in the box is green with the white racing stripe down the middle and on the bottom side and that's it.  Everything else you'll need to add yourself.  On the positive side& this means that you can always change the sticker order and make the car unique.Most of the stickers on the sheet are fairly easy to take off and place on the car& but the 2 side stickers with the big 20 on have a long strip at the bottom with writing and this has broken off as I removed it on one side.  The other side came off in one piece& but was very tricky to stick on the car.  They really should have made that part separate& or added it to the car already.The second thing to note is that the car is really light.  That probably explains the speed& but it also makes the car prone to coming off the track a lot easier.  It's going to take a while to master the cornering on this model& but I guess that's half the fun of the system and does help negate some of the speed advantage when playing against rival cars.Despite the mention on the product details& this model is NOT Digital or ready for the digital controllers& it's a standard Scalextric car.  It's something I hope Amazon will amend in future as they have done with the title.Overall& though& despite the sticker issue& I'm pretty impressed with the speed of this car and I'll be getting another to match it for future races."
3410,1012,3," Lightweight and nifty& this is the first additional car that we've had for our 1:32 scale Scalextric track (not to be confused with the new mini versions& which I haven't tried yet)& this GT Lightning Slot Car picks up some serious speed on the track& which is equally fun and frustrating.It's good to have a car that differentiates itself in this way. Although the new magnetising features means that the newer cars adhere to the tracks better than the ones I used to race in my youth& this is still prone to flying off if you take corners at high speeds. Probably for the best then& that this particular model is very simple and difficult to break.As a parent I found the set of stickers that came with the car frustrating& and wondered what effect it would have on the price to receive a complete car straight out the box. Overall though& the stickers are beside the point. The GT Lightning Slot Car moves like lightning and should last& so there isn't really a lot to grumble about!"
3411,1012,5," Lightning quick car& quite robust& only weak point is the spoiler won't stand the test of time with little people playing with them. ours broke that day. if you use this car on full throttle it will probably launch off the track on a bend. be prepared to spend a little time applying the decals to the car upon opening.we have a quick build set with the cars that smash and break into lego style pieces& it can be a little tedious at times& so this is an ideal accompaniment.the other downside which doesn't detract from the review is the braids. It's a proven fact the Scalextric's braids are simply not upto the job.The answer - do not buy replacement braids similar or manufactured by Scalextric. They are simply not worth the time& hassle and cost. I would strongly advise to buy a better quality braid the brings the track to life. There's no more stop starting& no more fiddling around. What we have is hours of fun and consistency. The connections are 100x better& and the longevity of the braid completely outshines the Scalextric version. I purchased a 5m roll for Â£7 incl delivery. Look at [...]"
3412,1012,4," A nice looking car although to give it any real definition you have to apply the stickers that come separately with it. Unfortunately I was just getting into my stride having unpacked my several years old track when the blooming scalextric set (not car) went kaput after about ten laps (the track? power unit?) So based on a short testing time& it went like the clappers& feels nicely balanced and looks sleek just a shame applying the stickers was longer in duration than my chance to use it!"
3413,1013,5," Excellent Thank you"
3414,1014,5," Love this car.  Looks cool!"
3415,1015,5," Excellent Thank you"
3416,1016,5," Very good deal. Will return."
3417,1017,5," I purchased this item for my neighbors son's birthday&so I'm not REALLY in a position to write a fair review-BUT)I WILL make my own review of sorts:-I only saw James(lad I bought it for)-playing with it once...in our block of flats(I'm grnd level)...I have a ramp to enable easy access to the back of the block when using my mobility scooter-James also uses it for his skateboard practice&"
3418,1017,5," Great fun for the kids& good delivery serviceÂ¡Â¡Â¡"
3419,1017,5," It good and fun"
3420,1018,5," Scalextric first showed a prototype of this model in the catalogue about 30 years ago. It never reached production& but now& as a classic& it comes and is all the better for the wait. Modern manufacturing means it is a very detailed model& the livery printed beautifully and& best of all& the wheels and tyres modelled accurately.  I'm biased& I worked with these 9real) cars so I'll be buying lots of them."
3421,1018,5," Awesome car& santa dropped a digital track and cars off for my 7yr old this xmas and we have loved it but now we have added to our collection and this car is really good quality& has great details& the lights work and grips to the track like glue. I have waited some 30yrs for this car and i can tell it has been worth the wait. If you are thinking about it &don't& just do it its a no brainer& i may even buy another one. Very happy."
3422,1018,4," Present for grandson. Het tried it out on 27th& seems to work very well& and was extremely pleased with it. Working lights& and magnets to hold on track add to the package."
3423,1018,5," Superb detail and quality. My son (31) loved it."
3424,1019,4," Cars kept falling off the track initially because of the guide under the car wasn't deep enough. took them to a specialist store who rectified the issue. Build quality though was really good and detail was excellent."
3425,1019,5," Had for about a week now and up to now is still working and nothing has fallen off but see other reviews and can be a completely different story."
3426,1019,5," Brilliant car with superb graphics"
3427,1020,5," This is a brilliant scalextric car. When I oppened the box I was instantly amazed by how nice it looked. Opon raceing I found that it is about three times faster than my other cars. I definitely suggest buying this car."
3428,1020,5," Very nice car! Well detailed and works perfectly well! 5 Stars"
3429,1021,5," Arrived very quickly& well packaged& as described& very happy birthday boy!"
3430,1021,5," Great car& my son loves it!"
3431,1021,4," Very nice model& great style. Magnatraction is weak& should be improved. Good stability and power."
3432,1022,5," Good car"
3433,1023,4," My nephew loves it. Expensive for what it is though. Hey ho!"
3434,1023,5," Very please with my purchase of mario coin crasher"
3435,1023,3," Bit broke off the back too easy & disappointed"
3436,1023,1," Neck broke after 5 seconds of play"
3437,1024,5," came &early than expected & brilliant  packaging to prevent damage and it was definitely worth the moneyi say more people should look in to your great products and i will buy more from you in the futor"
3438,1024,5," Straight back to childhood yeah"
3439,1025,5," Exactly as expected & a scalextric car at a good price"
3440,1026,5," I absolutely love this set! It brings back memories of childhood and those terribly competitive races against my sibling and other young relatives. Now I have children of my own& I am introducing them to the delights of Scalextric - and it is just as much fun as I remember! I am pleased to report that this set has also sparked enthusiasm in them - even though the younger daughter is too young to really play yet she is delighted watching the cars go round the track.The set is easy to put together and to get up and running - it took me under half an hour - it would take less than this next time now I am used to it again. There are 4 different track options available with the set. The cars don't seem to be quite as strong as I remember them to be& but having had a competition on the track tonight - they survived... The handsets seem to be very responsive although I discovered it isn't like riding a bike - I needed to get used to it again! My partner is pleased with the cars - Mini's are a firm favourite with her.Overall& this is an absolutely brilliant set which adults and children will enjoy. It seems to made to a high standard and I see no reason why it won't last for years to come.Would recommend."
3441,1026,5," What a great racing toy - bought for my 6 year old son& who was very pleased with his gift.  It makes a nice present as it's a good size and looks and feels like a BIG gift& but actually great value for the cost.Lots of fun to put together and a very rugged& good quality toy.  You get two cars which are tough enough to cope with pinging off the track at high speed.  The box contains enough track to build several different racing circuits - most configurations are circular so that one car has to travel further& but you are able to build a fly-over so that both have the same number of turns.It is possible to have a really good race and the controllers have a nice level of play in them so that you can increase the speed by very small increments.I'd recommend this 1:32 kit over some of the smaller sets - great for younger kids as well as the cars and track all feel nigh-on indestructible."
3442,1026,4," I wonâ€™t lie& I got this as I never had one as a kid and saw it as a perfect opportunity to live those missed days.The set is easy to set up& everything& except the track is nice and small. You can assemble the track into different layouts but the kids havenâ€™t been off it long enough for me to change it yet.The cars look good and have survived a few off-track incidents caused by a little too much excitement around the bends!The track is rather big â€“ so it might involve making room to lay it out& we definitely canâ€™t leave it out& but saying that it took about 20 mins to put together so it isnâ€™t a huge issue to put together and clear away.It looks well built and as other people have said it canâ€™t see why it wonâ€™t last for years to come.  Hope you have as much fun as I am with it!****Just a little warming â€“ the amazon page has the age suitability wrong again. The box states 5+ although any younger child that has good hand eye co-ordination will enjoy& and develop their skill. ****"
3443,1026,1," My son loves this but it's so tempremental& one of the cars has already stopped working& no idea why.Update: is now not working& got some replacement bits for the cars but still not working. Have had it for just over a month& very disappointing."
3444,1026,5," My husband wanted this as he regretted not having a scalextric set in his youth! It may not be the most sophisicated set but it seems to have done the job and many happy hours racing have been enjoyed!"
3445,1026,5," grandson thought it was great and so did I& only trouble was he kept beating me and his 5 1/2 and I'm 67..........but great toy easy to use and assemble"
3446,1026,5," Really good. Easy to set up& cars are study and 4 different tracks to build. Highly recommend this product very good value for money."
3447,1026,5," Upgrade from a set bought in the early 80s. Easy fit track and connections. Sturdy cars and handsets.Mains and handset leads could be much longer though? Great fun structuring and racing on the option track settings.Best xmas present bought for grandson to date"
3448,1027,5," Purchased for my toddler during the Black Friday offers.A fun set& had no major problems so far. If the trigger isn't pulled hard enough the electrical connections between the track and cars tend to go.Also keep an eye on the connections (braids) on the cars base& the set comes with spares& so if the cars start playing up simply replace or adjust them.Personally keep the box and to ensure longevity pack it up when not in use.My son loves the fact the cars break on contact& the Lego style cars are easy to build but as the adult it's a little annoying from my part that I'm constantly having to build over and over again.*********UPDATE********** PROBLEM SOLVED**********It's a proven fact the Scalextrics braids are simply not upto the job. They are the main reason reviews are poor.The answer - do not buy replacement braids similar or manufactured by Scalextric. They are simply not worth the time or hassle. I would strongly advise to buy a better quality braid the brings the track to life. There's no more stop starting& no more fiddling around. What we have is hours of fun and consistency. The connections are 100x better& and the longevity of the braid completely outshines the Scalextric version. I purchased a 5m roll for Â£7 incl delivery. Look at http:"
3449,1027,4," Good fun - For the people who found the cars stopped in parts of the track shortly after purchase we found the same and after some frustration and changing the brushes found it was actually because the front wheels were lifting the metal pickups off the track in certain parts& so stopping the current getting to the motor. Removing the front wheels (just pull them off) solved the problem& not 100%ideal but they are only cosmetic anyway"
3450,1027,3," There is no doubt that the idea here is great and for the first half hour of play it is& but then the design flaws emerge. As soon as the braids wear in then you will find the cars stop constantly. Firstly the braid is not hard wearing enough and that causes it to split and move which doesn't help with drift based cars but also the front wheels then become a problem as they lift the car to the point of the braids no longer being able to make contact with the track once they've been worn in. Solutions are to change the braids which you effectively need to do every hour& take the front wheels off ( a stupid solution but it's a pretty successful one) or find an alternative 3rd party braid replacement which I saw an earlier reviewer mention. I'm going to try that. I reckon a creative solution with existing lego pieces from kids collection might do it also. Do I regret the purchase? Not really& it's fun in bursts and the kids love it while it's running smoothly and once we get a better solution for the braids then it will be fine. The cars look great and crash brilliantly& the drifting element makes the kids giddy with excitement and they love strategically trying to take out the other driver. We've had a few Scalextric sets and this is in some ways the best yet but in others it's a lot more frustrating.."
3451,1027,5," Truly amazing.  The fun of scalextric with the unlimited options of Lego - yes the cars are made from 'building system blocks' which are 100% compatible with Lego.  Effectively this is Lego racing& although the marketing department at Scalextric are probably wincing at the phrase.With its intended use& you simply build the cars& which doesn't take long& lay out the track as normal (I haven't used Scalextric for 30 years& but not much has changed) and then off you go with a squeeze of the throttle.  It's good fun&But what makes this set truly special is the ability to pimp your cars by adding your Lego collection.  Mini-figures for drivers (we have been racing Darth Vader against Harry Potter!) and standard bricks to trick out your ride.It quickly becomes a demolition derby and I have been teaching my 3 1/2 year old the principles of centre of gravity - his 'tower car' can't take corners.Incredible fun and with unlimited varations.  The Lego Friends animal hospital team are working as a pit crew"
3452,1027,5," What a fantastic Scalextric set.  Purchased for my three year old son (and myself) for Xmas& the idea of chasing a robber in a police car with working sirens would have probably been enough to convince me to buy this set& couple that with the ability to knock bits off the cars when they hit each other and spin round the track and you've got a fantastic set for youngsters.Additionally the cars can be re-built using a popular form of building brick!  This allows you to race some really odd contraptions around the track.All in all a very good starter set with a decent size track and great cars."
3453,1028,4," What can you say about a back scratcher???Well& what I will say is that it makes my life so much easier. I am not sure if I just have short arms& and big back or what& but there are places I get an itch sometimes that I just can't reach and it drives me nuts. As a back scratcher it works perfectly. Not too sharp so your left with a pain or rawness after a 'good scratch'& and plenty of wide handle to grip so you can get good control over the angle and twist& so you can get the fingers of the scratch in just the right place if you know what I mean.I must admit I dont really use the massage wheel things& but do find myself just playing with them while I have it in my hand and maybe having a bit of a think...The only thing I will say& is order 2 or 3 of them. Once you get a good back scratcher& its annoying having to go from one room to the next in an emergency scratch situation& and silly to carry it everywhere you go :-)"
3454,1028,5," What a great product it is. If you are reading this review& chances are you don't need any explanation how itchy back can decrease quality of life dramatically. Yet a simple product worth Â£3.97 can make you happier than two weeks holiday in 5-star all-inclusive spa resort.No more begging your missus to scratch |that spot lower& to the left& not that much& higher& not there| for hours. No more embarrassment when you're caught rubbing your back against furniture. Now you can be an independent backscratcher no matter how fit you are. I wouldn't have thought that a piece of bamboo can have so many uses until I bought it:- Scratch your back& anytime& anywhere& sitting& lying down or taking a shower!- Rub your heels without having to bend your back!- Stick it in your sleeve and make Â£Â£Â£ running pirate themed children parties!- Use it to reach TV remote or pull sweets from under the sofa (remember to remove green fluffy bits before eating!)- Buy four of them& glue together and use as a skateboard!- Make practical jokes poking people!- Troll your cat!- Use it as a marble launcher!- Play drums with it!- Use it as a whiteboard pointer (yes& it does have educational value!)These are just a few of endless exciting possibilities. I am now ordering another one to keep in my car& just in case I drop that damn oil cap again!"
3455,1028,5," Did exactly as described and stopped my husband using the corners of walls to sort his itchy back!"
3456,1028,4," Fun thing to buy. My family enjoys them still. I kept one for my self. Its use is a bit more dignified than rubbing my back against a fixed object. However it does not stop the itch moving elsewhere."
3457,1029,5," this set was for my 11 year old son who loves the olympics&this was perfect for his collection on london 2012"
3458,1030,4," I was lucky enough to be offered this stunning Scalextric GT Lightning Slot car in Purple and seeing as my grandchildren have a small track I was really pleased.  They were absolutely over the moon with it. In their words |it is awesome|.  I also was offered a White model& Scalextric 1:32 Scale GT Lightning Slot Car (White) and one grandson prefers the purple and the other the white& so a good result all around.This is a pretty basic super-resistant generic GT racing car.  It's not a model of any 'real car' but has design elements resembling a number of different real-world GT cars including the SRT Viper& Corvette& and Nissan Z.  The GT Lightning comes in its basic overall color& in this case White& with a sheet of peel-and-stick decals provided for numbers and other graphics to finish the car as shown.This is an excellent low-cost& durable car for children&  and beginners&  and is able to stand up to lots of crashing and bashing.  It is not digital plug-ready but can be adapted for use on any digital system by installing the appropriate retro-fit digital chip."
3459,1030,4," This is a good looking Scalextrix car. It arrives just in black and purple with some strong clear base stickers to decorate it. The box picture is good and clear if you want to copy the sticker layout completely. We've got the very good Destruction Derby base set so it's good to have these stronger& solid cars which run well on the track. Just the rear boot spoiler clips on and off& all the other bits are strong and durable. The wing mirrors are solid and tiny so shouldn't break off easily. In the Scalextric scheme of things these are most suited to younger children 5+ who are rough with their cars. This can take some bashing about. It comes with 2 track connectors but not the digital chip.Recommended to add to your Scalextric fleet."
3460,1030,3," We've got a few scalextric cars so were excited about this addition to the fleet which we got along with the white version.On a plus& the car is well made& with the exception of the spoiler which on the white car came off and broke within 30 seconds of play"
3461,1030,5," When I was offered this car I knew my grandson had a Scalextric set so did not hesitate to order it. It's from the maker's low-cost Super Resistant range that have no interior detail and lack transparent windows but by recompense are said to suffer impacts better than the more expensive models.Grandson's report is favourable& he says it's 'awesome' because it has a 'drifitng' feature that apparently simulates a power slide. After happily applying the supplied decals he has tested it on track and is well pleased with its performance. So that's it& approved by a 10 year old makes it more than good enough for me to recommend."
3462,1030,4," This car seems to drive well& but I must admit in our household we are far from the best slot car drivers.The appearance of the car is excellent though. Very stylish and aspirational. The range of four colour options is a little disappointing though. A car in Red& Yellow& or Orange would have offered more contrast.Also puzzling is why the car stickers for the four cars& have only two different race numbers.Whilst I do prefer this car to our existing cars& I just can't get hugely excited about it. It is good& but I don't love it. So for that reason I'm giving just a respectable four stars."
3463,1030,4," This is a pretty decent if basic Scalextric car.  It is simply moulded and not particularly well detailed or fixtures.  The car comes with stickers that you can attach yourself& adding to the budget feel of the product when you take it out of the box.It drives OK and competes well with the other cars in my fleet.  As with most scalextric cars you get good performance out of the motor when new.  It has taken a smash or two and survived unscathed so am quite happy with it.I don't have digital scalextric so can't comment on how easy it is to use with those sets or how tricky it is to adapt it."
3464,1030,3," This is a more 'budget' level car& but it's sturdy enough in comparison to some of the older vehicles I have.The wheels definitely look a tad cheap& but all-in-all it's a nice burner.You'll have to apply the decals yourself& which can be a bit fiddly. I'd rather have them already applied.It's not one of my standout cars& but definitely something I'll have out for the nephews â€“ I won't be concerned if this takes a bashing.(If you're into your GT lightning series& there's a number of colour and sticker variations available - obviously it's the same car/model.)"
3465,1031,4," Scalextric digital is a fantastic evolution of the game and this allows existing cars to be converted& at a price. Discounted multi packs would be nice for those with an established collection of cars& and why are new cars not coming bundled with chips?"
3466,1031,5," i fitted one of theese to a car for the 1st time today& it took me around 3 minutes. Its a very simple procedure"
3467,1031,4," I bought my son a car but did not realise I had to buy this item separately. It does seem like an expensive addition but it is easy to fit and use. It could be cheaper though!"
3468,1031,5," These completely enhance your racing experience and the family and I are having a great time after digitising the cars.  You can fit it in approx 40 seconds."
3469,1031,3," Since buying the digital set& these digital chips have stopped working on more cars than I care to remember& for no aparent reason& necesitating extremely expensive recurring replacements. Almost every time someone uses a car& one of these chips goes down. Very poor quality."
3470,1031,5," There's not really an alternative.  If you have cars with the DPR socket then this is by far the easiest way to make them digital. If you want anything more complicated or more powerful& you won't be reading this review you'll be on a forum or talking to people at a club."
3471,1031,5," Easy to fit - done within minutes.  Makes SOME scalextric cars useable on digital sets.  Make sure you buy the correct size (ie this is for saloon cars).  Also make sure that the car you wish to convert is digital plug ready."
3472,1031,5," C8515 fits all DPR 2/ 4 seat cars in the scalextric range & it allows the car to change lanes"
3473,1032,5," Good delivery& great cars"
3474,1033,5," The car comes bare but with the stickers for you to attach and it also comes with two spare pick-ups along with the one already attached to the car so three pick-ups in total.  The stickers are a little fiddly to attach to the car but that is part of the fun (or so my husband reliably informs me).  The car feels well balanced and the tyres are of a nice soft rubber which seems to grip the track well.  It seems reasonably sturdy and has taken a few bashes already.  My husband also has the Scalextric 1:32 Scale GT Lightning Slot Car (White) and I believe the model comes in green and purple too. A really good standard car and I am told the ones with working headlights etc cost a lot more but this is really good value for the price."
3475,1033,5," I have been collecting and racing Scalextric for about 50 years and have found that Scalextric cars are pretty rugged.  I was intrigued by this range of resilient cars.My children have grown up and there is a new generation of 'test to destruction' drivers.They enjoyed decorating the cars with the supplied stickers then tested the Magnetraction to see if the magnets allowed the car to corner at full speed.  Not quite but still a lot lot faster than older cars& even the Magnetraction ones.We now have two of these cars& one white& one blue.  The white one is a few weeks older and is 'run in' so is slightly quicker.  I am certain this blue one will be just as quick after a few hours of running time.I am going to buy others in this range& at this price& they are bargain."
3476,1033,5," Bought two cars for my twin grandsons for there 4th birthday this year the cars was absolutely fantastic on the scaletric track they held traction  all the way round  my son said that the 1:32 scale GT  cars was better then the cars that came with the new scaletric box .so the twins had great fun playing with there new cars so when I asked if I could play one of the twins said no nana it's  not for girls ."
3477,1033,4," All ok except the rear spoiler really isn't up to much.  The car inevitably comes off the track when being raced and the spoiler didn't stay attached for very long at all.  Arrived quickly though."
3478,1033,5," A good addition to the cars and track set that is enjoyed by all ages. As others have said& putting your own stickers on adds to the enjoyment. It's made to the usual good standard"
3479,1033,5," Good basic car - my grandson loved it as it matched the model of the faster and more stable of the two cars supplied in the his first Scalectrix set."
3480,1033,4," I'm no scalextric expert but this is a nice car& fiddly stickers to put on but fun and works fine with the track& as expected."
3481,1033,4," Nice fast car - very reasonable priceDifficult to transfer the stickers on to the car"
3482,1034,5," I was very happy with my purchase! it's lovely and exactly what it states on the box& bought for my daughter and she couldn't be happier with it."
3483,1034,5," Perfect for the colletion!"
3484,1035,4," Do yourselves a favour and disregard the |other| bad review.  This series are nice starter slot car sets from one of the oldest (if not the oldest) manufacturers.The pieces DO fit together unless your hands consist of 4  thumbs and 1  finger each. Tie clips are provided so that the pieces stay together.  The supports are a little unstable but the track is not meant to be nudged about.  The cars do fly off IF YOU DO NOT DRIVE THEM!!!  ie if you do not control the throttle!!  If you go flat out all the time the cars will go off the much like a real car would. So there is a degree of difficulty& and I would say the minimum age is about 6 years (for an average kid.)Much better toy for a six year old boy than all that other stuff floating around."
3485,1035,5," Just what we wanted for a 4 and 6 year old. Track simple to put together. Cars stay on and are simple to operate for small hands."
3486,1035,5," My grandson loves this racing set and we were impressed with the speed in which the item arrived. Thank you"
3487,1035,2," After unwrapping the set the main part of the track was broke and so was one of the cars.After using an old piece of track from a previous set to get started&  to get  a F1 car to loop the loop is a virtual impossibility for me never mind my son.Very dissapointed ans xmas was only saved because i had a previous set to make a good????"
3488,1036,5," Works well and is fast around the track."
3489,1037,5," Be careful of low bridges.Spotlight gets knocked off"
3490,1037,5," very pleased with the product and service provided :)"
3491,1037,5," Fantastic"
3492,1038,5," Excellent Thank you"
3493,1039,4," Have set this car up for the new digital style track with a plug in& but it does not hold the track very well& so have sent off for a set of stronger magnets which should help.  It is a great colour& but I can't see the spindly wing mirrors lasting long in our house!"
3494,1039,4," My grandson likes the car but was a bit disappointed that the headlights did not light up"
3495,1039,1," Bought it for my grandson and it keeps breaking down. Very disappointed ."
3496,1040,5," My Grandson absolutely loves this car. This is his favourite toy at the moment he even takes it to bed with him.Well worth the money."
3497,1040,5," Nicely made car& all talking phrases you can understand whats being said unlike some talking vehicles"
3498,1040,5," another Xmas present for my 2 1/2 yr old grandson whose hero is Lightening McQueen& the price of this item was very affordable and it is sturdy quality. There is a button on top of the hood when pressed it makes the sound of a sports car revving up and I just know J|Little Man| will be delighted"
3499,1040,5," Got for a fab price& my 3 year old loves it - however& it's really loud and gets very irritating after he's been playing with it for a while. He's just as happy with it when the sound is switched off though so no big deal!"
3500,1040,5," I have bought this for my grandson for Christmas so it hasn't been played with yet& but I'm sure he will love it& as he is car mad.  He'll probably want to take it to bed with him."
3501,1040,5," A great toy& which my 5 year old loves as he is mad on Disney's Cars& but it is a little noisy!! Should have really come with free ear defenders !!!  :)"
3502,1040,5," Oh my son (3) just adores his new lightening McQueen. He's a massive cars fan& and loves the sayings on this toy& reciting them around the house!"
3503,1040,5," Love it. Got it for Â£11.89 in the black friday sales and would still have paid full price. Very sturdy and an awesome toy for my son."
3504,1041,5," Really nice and well detailed little car. I know some people knock the micro scalextric  but if you font have room for a big layout these are great . The main thing is to look after the braids and all will be fine"
3505,1041,5," Great value& great product& great delivery."
3506,1042,5," Everything I wanted. Easy to put together."
3507,1043,5," bought for a present"
3508,1044,5," Super car very quick but loose because long wheel base a handful in the corners."
3509,1044,5," Good delivery& great cars"
3510,1045,5," Great& very fast service. Highly recommended!!!"
3511,1046,4," Useful spares for Scalextric& as repeated use does wear these parts out.Note that there are several different types of blade and brushes& so make sure you get the right one - don't just buy these assuming they'll fit your car!"
3512,1046,5," Have a scareletrix and the bottoms were always coming apart. ordered these for spares but actually they have stayed on really well."
3513,1046,5," A must for all Scalextric users. Within a day of receiving a new set& my grandson needed spare brushes for the cars. I remembered from many years ago that you need a considerable supply of these to minimise frustration when children are using the racing game"
3514,1046,5," The braids are quick change and the guide blades sometimes break.  Always handy to have spares."
3515,1046,3," Nothing wrong with the product& most of Scalextric products are 5 star. The price is scandalous& as is most their products. June"
3516,1046,5," Not much to say other than well made and do exactly what you would expect them to.  I would happily purchase these again."
3517,1046,4," These are very easy to replace & after many family scalextric competitions we need to odd replacement"
3518,1046,4," Not quite the right guide but I only needed the brushes so all good."
3519,1047,5," Great!"
3520,1048,5," great car lights are smart given myself and 4 year old hours of great fun car very durable it has to be"
3521,1048,5," Grandson loves this car especially how it lights up"
3522,1049,5," Arrived very promptly"
3523,1049,5," A well priced scalextric product"
3524,1049,5," Great car very quick delivery"
3525,1049,3," got here in the end"
3526,1050,4," This is a really lovely little car. It is beautifully made and the quality of the wood and little components is excellent. The concept of the toy is great and my children love taking it to pieces and reconstructing it - it's very educational and requires thought from them in matching the right components together along with the correct shapes. My only minor grumble would be that although the wheels go round enabling you to push the car backwards and forwards with ease& they don't turn& so at times the wheels pop off when the kids are turning corners or going around things. Perhaps mine are being too heavy handed with it! Otherwise a great toy and I would recommend it as a really nice quality and unusual gift."
3527,1050,5," fab car my daughter loves it& only fault is the colour& ordered car in pink for my daughters birthday was disapointed to find the car was sent in red although it stated pink on the box but great& well built toy"
3528,1051,4," My 3 year old son loves this little set - Lightning McQueen and Guido work together - Guido fills Lightning's tank up (by depressing a little button where the petrol cap is)& you then press the rear window and off the car goes.Lightning has some nice vocal touches and will zip along in a straight line for 5 meters or so on a full tank.This toy doesn't seem that durable - I fully expect it to break within a few months& but I don't feel it's bad value given the cost.  All in all& despite the sophistication of the tank-filling procedure& it's a pretty basic toy& and doesn't have the same interactive potential as the other Pixar-derived toys (I know they're not made by Pixar and the toys are all put together by different companies& but it's natural to compare with the likes of Buzz Lightyear for instance).As with the film& this is a notch down from other Pixar offerings& but my son's very happy indeed with the toy& and that's really what counts I guess..."
3529,1051,3," My little boy is obsessed with Cars 2 but this is one of the few things that he doesn't really return to.  When he first played with it his eyes lit up but after half an hour or so it was discarded and he only now plays with it when he 'finds' it when looking for something else.It's well put together& the sound is good and the interaction with the other character (Guido) sounds promising but in reality isn't.  Guido is not really required (the petrol can he holds just presses a switch on the side of the car) and you simply press another button to set Lightning going for 20 feet or so.Shame really - it could have been a lot better."
3530,1051,4," I bought 2. One didn't have the sound on the roof& so sent it back and replacement arrived very quickly. Still going& the plastic is not the hardest& but so far it has endured the hard treatment from two 3 year old boys. So& good. They love that it talks to them. little Guido is very sweet too."
3531,1051,3," This car is worth under a tenner& it doesnt do much at all. Even on a full tank the car actually goes as far as a metre! My son however& does enjoy playing with it but gets bored fairly quickly. The plastic is fairly poor."
3532,1051,3," After over 10 days waiting on this to arrive when paid extra for faster delivery& disappointed on the size of toy and how far it actually goes when a full tank& would definitely not Reccomend company that supplied and let down with product."
3533,1051,5," Got this at fantastic price& got as present & would buy again all the kids wanted it & would recommend as kids get so much play and fun out of it any lighting mc queen fan would be delighted :)"

3535,1052,5," A Beautiful minature"
3536,1053,5," Our r/c crazy son has been running and racing cars and trucks for about four years& and the Traxxas Bandit was his first higher-end remote control vehicle... and it has probably been his favorite.We have burned through many sets of tires (slicks& Anacondas& Alias and knobbies) and have gone through more than our fare share of bearings& but man-o-man has it been worth it. The Bandit is an A+ ride for its price!We live in a community with blacktop roads and light traffic& and these Anaconda tires are fantastic on that surface. Tons of control& great wear& and a whole bunch of speed. Even when the streets are wet from a rain& these tires keep the car under control without any problem. The only wear issue is caused by my son's love of sliding the car sideways to a stop from 45+ mph... that will tend to flatspot the tires& but that is not the tire's fault! Other tires can't take the force and blow off altogether& but these hold together well.Our property has about an acre of grass& dirt and hills and he feels that the Traxxas Alias rear tires are the best for that type of off road use& while these Anacondas just can't be beat on pavement.These tires are mounted on Traxxas Tracer wheels& also the same as Bandit factory original and can be used on the stock Bandit XL-5 or VXL. These wheels are installed with the Traxxas pin-hub& not with the hex bolt& which is fine for us since that is the way that the original Bandit setup came.The Bandit greatly exceeded my expectations as a toy for our son. It has been& and continues to be& an outstanding learning experience for him and that has been a blast to watch evolve. These tires are just another part of that fun journey.Go for it and have fun!"
3537,1054,4," Carrera offered the Porsche RS Spyder in 1/43 scale in several liveries. The wheel and tyre diameters are substantially over-size (which produces sufficient ground clearance for Carrera Go loop sets at the expense of scale fidelity) but the bodyshell and tampo printing are very good."
3538,1055,3," OK& but just a bit of plastic placed on the front of normal salty& gets lost very easily& will be glued on when found!"
3539,1055,5," My grandson love's his train& thank you for a quick delivery."
3540,1056,4," Nice detail. Nice balance with motor towards front and magnet towards rear - stable on track. Quieter than other cars.Would have 5 stars if more crash resistant / child friendly& but then this range is not intended for children."
3541,1056,5," Beautiful example of this stunning car."
3542,1057,5," I wanna start by saying that it's an amazing toy for its value. ..I crashed more than 40 times but still works like it's newamazinghighly recommended"
3543,1058,4,""
3544,1059,5," Amazing!!!"
3545,1060,5," Fast delivery& excellent toy"
3546,1061,3," Did not increase the range but for the price they work well..fit onto walkera 250 runner  and my fat shark fpv goggles with no issues.."
3547,1061,4," Took a few weeks to arrive. Good build& no issues"
3548,1061,5," Just the job"
3549,1062,5," An excellent indoors helicopter. It looks quite menacing& and has a bright light shining under the cockpit when it is flying.My 9 year old thinks it's fantastic (as does Dad!)A well detailed model& and robust when it hits objects."
3550,1063,4," I had the orginal bebop (OBB) and this review is going to focus on the main differences as there are already a ton of reviews on OBB and this only takes that as a base and improves on it. At first glance they look quite similar there are actually few components that I can see that are the same from the original except for the ones that shouldn't be the same& like the camera itself.First the good:Much improved performance between generations - it climbs and flies much faster than the original Bebop (OBB) making it useful for more applications where it previously would have been too slow.Battery life is up there with the best consumer drones at 20-25 mins which should be enough time and range for typical scenarios.It's around 25% bigger than OBB but you get a lot of extra performance for a small impact on portability whilst it's still small compared to the DJI Phantoms& meaning you can put it in backpack whereas other drones need a 'look at me everyone' attache case.The new BB2 colour scheme design looks seriously impressive and reminds me of the DJI Inspire 1. The OBB looks like a kid's toy.Overall build quality is much higher. The H or X is more aerodynamic and much stronger so I think crash costs will be cheaper with this version.New battery loading mechanism is light years ahead of the embarrassment of the OBB.GPS performance& which was awful with the OBB is absolutely rock solid now and gets quicker and better aquisition so you're less likely to have drone incidents.The camera can now face straight down instead of mostly down and slightly ahead with OBB.Switches on and off faster than the original.The rear flashing light is extremely useful as it is so easy to lose the drone or orientation even at fairly close distances.Read more â€º"
3551,1063,4," I was a bit nervous about my first couple of flights due to a couple of reviews about this drone disconnecting& however I am now on 10+ flights and haven't had a single problem.Good points --Faster and more agile than expected.-Really easy for a novice to fly and incredibly stable.-Responsive with little lag on the controls-Quiet compared with other quadcopeters and helicopters I have flown. You can't even hear it once it's quite high.-You can place limits on the distance and speed of the drone. I found this useful for my first couple of flights& so I wasn't concerned about it flying away.-Return home function for when the drone is out of range-Flight time of 25 minutes and a chick charge time of only 45 minutes.The bad -I can't really think of anything that bad to say about this drone& other than navigating through menus in the app can be a bit clunky. That said& the actual flight controls in the app (free flight mode) are top notch. You can download the app now and have a look& but the free flight mode will only appear once your drone is connected.Flight plan (this is like an autopilot mode where you can set the path of the drone and other parameters such as altitude& speed& direction& and where to take pictures) is an additional Â£14.99& which I was initially annoyed at paying& but it turned out to be worth the money. It's also not  essential or even something that all users might use& so I can see why they chose to sell it as an add-on.Additional points --Only 1 battery included. Additional batteries are Â£59.99. I was going to order another battery& however the 20-25 minutes of flight time seem to be enough at the moment (especially in the cold weather).Read more â€º"
3552,1063,1," The software (which we updated before use) disconnects too readily and the drone does not make an emergency landing or return home when disconnected. My son got this for Christmas. When it worked it well and video footage was great. However& four days after Christmas& his drone disconnected at about 10m above his head and flew off& never to be seen again despite trying to press the emergency landing button. From what we read& the drone should have returned to home or made an emergency landing& but this didn't happen. The drone flew off out of view and our extensive efforts to search for it have proves fruitless."
3553,1063,1," This is such LOW quality product that I'm failing to understand how they came up with Â£440 price tag . Lets start from good - flies nicely .. thats it & rest is everything thats wrong for Â£440 . Video and picture quality stated is so misleading that if this was business trying to sell service & would be shut down by trading standards . Basically camera is 180 fish eye that may have 1080p container but all it is & is video has been produced at maybe 144x80 pixels and then has so much anti -aliasing to make file 1080p same and with photo & looks like image is only about 0.3 megapixel and then just simply produced 14megapixel resolution to fool people . And all this because of digital 3 axis stabilisation where only tiny amount of pixels being used to produce picture due to those pixels floating all over sensor to keep image horizontal regardless how drone is sitting . As this product not just for fun flying but as well as recording footage on board of absolutely useless 7.12gb of storage (not 8gb !) where it gets filled up with useless unwatchable video in no time and the only way to get it off of it is via computer and then deleting for next fly & what if you on holiday ? I have DJI S900 with A2 as well as few phantoms to film and take photos  ( only as hobby )and other smaller quads for fun where camera quality as important as quad itself as most people wanna see thing from birds eye .. but Parrot had different ideas and decided that as long as you can tell the difference from grass and sky then  what else do you want !?My advice& buy  phantom 3 standart that has good quality camera with mechanical gimbal and gives you 300m range via wifi and you get remote control for same money .Read more â€º"
3554,1064,5," the most |fun for the money| toy that ive ever had it only takes a few hours to master the controls & it does everything it claims to . it is fast & agile and super responsive to the controls with instant response whilst in flight .it is also very very robust and can take countless knocks crashes and heavy landings without any damage .obviously it is not indestructable and if eventually it does get damaged it comes with spare top and rear rotor blades as these are the first things that will get damaged . it is  very well designed as every part is replacable and available from various sellers which is a bonus & from the balance bar to the landing skids and are easy to replace just a few screws and a few minutes and you will be back in the air again. all in all this is a top product which puts far more expensive similar models to shame i would highly recommend this product to anyone"
3555,1064,5," Amazing little copter& great fun& very robust& had a lot of crashes to start with and it just bounces back. Batteries last about 7-8 minutes each which is fine for most case and they are easy to charge from any usb port. Had a few breakages& but parts are cheap and in most case easy to replace."
3556,1064,4," Wow great little toy& have bought indoor rc heli before which are good& but this one can be used indoors or out. would recommend for anyone wanting to fly for 1st time outside before progressing to something bigger."
3557,1064,3," three crashes and out&wobbles all over the place&bought new shaft upgraded head kit which took forever to arrive&and when it did guess what? yep your correct it doesn't fit."
3558,1064,5," After gaining a bit of experience on a 3ch Syma helicopter I chose this 4 Ch Copter based on other reviews and the fact that it would offer greater manoeuvrability.  I was not disappointed.  It took a little while to get used to it but the fact that it can operate outside is excellent.  It comes with two batteries which good for continuity and spare blades which I have luckily not had to use.  Despite being very flimsy to the feel it is also very robust and has been in some serious crashes and survived!  For just over Â£30 it has been excellent value for money."
3559,1065,5," absolutely brilliant. full stars. would recommend. but first learn with the little drones first. which i did. made me a better pilot."
3560,1065,5," Learn to fly a smaller cheaper drone first and you will have fun with this! Consider using prop guards and 'training landing gear' from another well known site& e___! something or other!"
3561,1065,5," Super quick delivery ! Thank you works well as man tried it out straight away! Thank you!"
3562,1066,5," Awesome fun"
3563,1067,1," I complement the seller on speed and diligence& but the battery& spare shell and the motors are NOT for the X4. They must be for a smaller version. The correct motors have two holes/ports on the top side next to the propellor shaft. The battery is also smaller than the X4. Seller& please contact me."
3564,1067,5," An essential buy for novice flyers. As a beginner it is inevitable that you will crash and probably quite heavily. As a result you are likely to damage propellers& at the very least.  Since it's about the same price to buy the crash pack as it is to buy 8 sets of propellers it seems pointless not to go for the option that gives you extra bits and pieces that could also suffer crash damage. Highly recommended."
3565,1067,5," A must have first accessory/purchase for anyone who buys an X4. I damaged a motor and lost 2 propellers all within the first week of having one!"
3566,1067,5," Arrived promptly and packaged well. The propellors are actually better than the original ones my Hubsan x4 came with as they seem to fit better and do not fall out whenever i have a minor crash. The spare battery seems fine but have only used it once so far so time will tell if it lasts as long as the original. I didnt expect all the items to come from Hubsan themselves rather than cheaper replicas& but they did and i was very pleased. I havnt needed to use any of the other items yet but they all look fine to me."
3567,1067,5," A must if you're getting to grips with  a quad copter& there's pretty much a replacement |everything| for one. Doesn't matter what you say you're gonna need some spare rotor blades and the rotor guard is so handy especially indoors& money well spent for piece of mind."
3568,1067,5," Exactly what I ordered. Genuine Hubsan branded spare parts."
3569,1067,4," A good set of parts especially as I have lost or broken all of the front B blades. I am quite surprised that the motors and LED's have to be soldered to the control board. I expected them to be plugged in as not everybody is good with a soldering iron."
3570,1067,3," Arrived better than my expectations considering it was at Christmas time. Though beware this quad copter is tiny fits in to the plan of your hand. It takes quite a lot of mastering and by the time you have mastered it boredom will have set in."
3571,1068,5," I bought this for my married son who is always too busy working or playing with his daughter. So I thought of a toy. As he is into photography this one with the camera was just right. He had hours of fun until it sustained too may crash landings. I have given it 5 stars becaus he loved it. Unfortunately I think it might be beyond repair now after a recent crash.I recomend the S107 as it stood up to a lot of knocks until the end. (maybe) Well worth the money. I looked at others but the onboard camera swung it for me.Great flying machine at a great price."
3572,1068,5," Very entertaining. Extremely durable.Flight time around 4-5 mins. Easy to use. Wouldn't bother with the camera as we never use it."
3573,1068,5," Nephew loved it...so good that even the adults wanted a go! Highly recommended and great price i havent seen elsewhere."
3574,1068,3," the SYMA S107C RC helicopter with camera is a bit small but ok"
3575,1068,3," Given to a grandchild. Not seen it since. Broken? Not liked? Who knows."
3576,1069,5," Great item"
3577,1070,5," An awesome indoor quad copter for beginners and for experienced pilots who want a rainy weather option.In 'S.A.F.E' mode it is really stable and so easy to fly and is as nimble a quick as you would expect in agile mode.The blade guards are designed perfectly to protect the rotors."
3578,1070,4," looks very flimsy& but flies great&I hope its as strong as advertised."
3579,1070,5," this is a bad  price there. we can get one for a good price here for Â£68http:"
3580,1070,3," It was not complete"
3581,1071,4," Great quadcopter - super powerful and far more stable in windy conditions. Only problem was with the camera (very poor quality). After only one flight the camera now will not work& and is now useless. Not sure what went wrong but it does start up with green light& but will not respond to the controller for video or stills (not happy!) I would consider getting a go pro or something else to bolt on. Other than that the quad is fantastic value for money and very powerful (watch your digits with the blades! ). It did take a long time to get to the UK&  however it was from China so I suppose that's fair enough. Also I got the extra batt package - this does come separate so don't worry if not in main delivery. Kokorest if you read these can you help with the broken camera at all as I can't get any response from your cust service????"
3582,1071,5," Nice seller& the quadcopter comes with extra battery& so I can fly it twice once the first battery dies out.And the seller sends me a GoolRC gift. Fantastic!!!"
3583,1071,5," Great drone for Christmas! I have kept it in my room& I believe it will surprise my son on Christmas day!"
3584,1071,4," My only complaint is that one of the led's on the arm of the quadcopter doesn't work properly."
3585,1071,5," RC  great quadcopter with a HD camera by Syma& very stable& love it."
3586,1072,5," I ordered this quadcopter for a friend who wanted me to unbox the quadcopter and get it all working.I received the quadcopter within 2 days& then proceeded to assemble and charge (assembling took roughly 15 minuits). Then calibrated it& following by a quick test flight& (if you want to see my recommended first time fly &extracted from my App available for iphone &DJI Phantom Unofficial Guide& go to the bottom of this review)Charging takes about 1-3 hours depending on settings on charger& battery life is about 10-13 mins. I personally recommend buying some more batteries of a website called first personview.co.uk they cost about Â£20 each.I personally think that this quadcopter is a great place to start if you are coming in to the world of quadcopter.But i use a group on Facebook called 'dji phantom owners page' for help.Pros and ConsPros"
3587,1072,5," Performs just as advertised - incredibly controllable. The gimbal camera mount is particularly impressive and compensates well for random movement of the drone due to air currents etc. Be aware that the gimbal needs a transmitter (available separately) to enable the output of the Hero Camera to be viewed realtime on a laptop& iPad& etc."
3588,1072,5," Great piece of kit. On the down side& you are left on your own to discover on utube and other web sites& how to actually calibrate and set up the Phantom 2 and Gimbal. Also the down loads for the PC to do this are not mentioned. This includes the return home programme& without it your Phantom 2 can fly off on it own!"
3589,1072,5," Very happy with everything. Arrived in good time and perfect condition. Now the fun starts!"
3590,1073,4," Seller had excellent communication. Yet to see results from product but it's well made and compact."
3591,1074,5," Great item"
3592,1075,5," arrived fast& very stable indoor flier& land and take off on a table mat& &well packed& so far my yorkies are leaving it alone so it is still flying in one piece lots of fun anyone can fly this it is very smooth in flight &recomended kenneth vine"
3593,1076,5," Fab item! Easy to use. My partner loves it and says it handles well. Our kids love chasing after the bubbles! :)"
3594,1076,5," tricky to start but good fun n the kids love it"
3595,1076,5," Verygood"
3596,1077,5," Being a quad flyer myself I bought this for my brother in law& it's fast& it's fun& responsive and the gyros are great. Brother in-law loves it as does my little niece. Flight time between 8-10 mins. charge time between 30-40 mins via USB. Would highly recommend for those starting out on quad flying."
3597,1077,5," best learning quadcopter for complete novice& good quality and exceded expectations"
3598,1078,5," 6 Stars! I'm greatly impressed by the quality of this product and for anyone worried about fitting a battery into it& It can fit a tattu 1300 and 1400 lipo inside. i would definitely recommend this for fpv racingAlso it arrived from china within 10 days"
3599,1079,5," This was a great yes for my husband he's a kid at heart he's also a photographer. So he was very amazed with it was so easy for him to start off and who takes the best pictures as well as he loves the fact there is no interference it's a very great! Quick shipping definitely worth the price. To see the smile on his face! Priceless"
3600,1079,5," I have received an sample product of this item so that I can do an honest and unbiased review. Hopefully this review will help some of you guys. This will be the first time I will be using this model& however I have cooperated with the seller a lot of times so I have high expectation. My review has no influence from the seller whatsoever so please keep that in mind. If you have any questions& please let me know! Thanks!First lets talk about the designs. Definitely loving all the white design. Usually I love all colorful things but there was this one time I received an colorful one and I thought it was really too much. This is Simple and yet very fashionable which is something I really like. It's not too fancy. This product comes with all the parts that you needed so please read the descriptions from the page on what you would be needing. Instructions are also very simple. It comes with easy instructions if this is your first time using the product. I have been using similar products of this so I have a jest of how to use. However& I would seriously recommend on reading it first. Also& please practice on flying the product at a lower level height. This is an sturdy product but it will still break if you crash into other things which I also need to be careful when flying it."
3601,1079,5," I got this for my nephew and he would not stop playing it. His dad kinda got mad at me cuz I bought this. He would not keep his hands off of it!"
3602,1079,5," This is an excellent quality drone with lighting fast response from the controls. Myself and my boys have had hours of fun with it .Very high standard of build quality.Arrived very quickly and in perfect condition."
3603,1079,5," The name is |upgraded version| so it is much better than the original one.It is much faster& with a better camera& and it doesn't break as fast either"
3604,1079,5," Amazyng Gyro Drone With 2MP HD Camera Its works great& it comes with everything you need. and fast shipping i got mine in 10 days"
3605,1079,5," Good fun to be had&battery was fully charged and its pretty easy to use provided stay away from the wind.Easy to assemble and easy to charge and change parts etc.Very pleased with my purchase and very good value for money."
3606,1079,5," Item arrived very quickly. Very satisfied with the item. Its Very easy to use and learn. Battery holds charge for a long time. I have Used it many times and it take high quality images. Very happy with the item."
3607,1080,5," Awesome little quadcopters for the price. Can't go wrong although I recommend purchasing many spare blades and perhaps a prop guard or two. A few spare blades are included but I'm new to these and the blades did not last long. Strongly regretted not purchasing more blades as I had to wait a week or so for the new blades to arrive leaving me unable to fly :( Do yourself a favour and get some spare blades!!"
3608,1080,5," Brought two of these for my boys for Christmas& they have had endless fun with them."
3609,1080,5," Item as described& thank you"
3610,1080,1," I ordered 4They only lasted 15 mins and broke!Waste of money!!"
3611,1080,5," Very good"
3612,1081,5," brilliant ( work like original blades ) and a fraction of the price of original parrot rotors."
3613,1081,5," Good propellers& shame about the drone itself but I am happy with the propellers."
3614,1081,5," Comes in original packaging. Absolutely same as the original ones."
3615,1082,5," Received and used adds a few mins flying time and have since ordered more of which im awaiting to arrive seem to last longer than the standard battery by a good few mins"
3616,1082,4," Tool a while to arrive but worked straight out of the package."
3617,1083,3," Great value for sure& did consider balancing them but didn't bother in the end and noticed no difference at all over originals in flight. For sure they do not feel as good quality as DJI originals but what the hell if they perform as well for a fraction ov the cost. By the way I also have a set of DJI carbon originals... now thwy are quality and strong.... but cost way more thsn these."
3618,1083,4," The guards are perfect& only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that the item arrived late. Would still recommend if you don't need the parts desperately!"
3619,1083,5," Fast delivery and good quality prop guards. When I can remember to fit them."
3620,1083,5," Just What my Phantom 3 Standard Needs& Highly Recommend this Item"
3621,1083,5," Great item have recommended them to friends and family works really well"
3622,1083,5," Came very quick great  fits fine good to keep dust out of motors"
3623,1083,4," eventually worked out how to fit but once done look the part."
3624,1083,5," Products are very good everything is OK thank you"
3625,1084,4," These batteries are a great boost to your flying time but they defiantly don't last as long as the one that came with the quadcopter.Having just flown it from full charge I got 3 minutes of flight compared to 4.5 min on the stock one.Not bad I guess but the battery ratings are identical so I would expect the same.The body length is slightly shorter also.I would like to be able to find an up rated battery somewhere as a flight time of say 10 minutes would be perfect.Any suggestions?"
3626,1084,5," Good quality battery - works well with Syma X8g"
3627,1084,5," Good product& longer delivery time"
3628,1084,5," Ideal spare batterys"
3629,1085,5," Fitted fine"
3630,1086,5," Haven't needed them yet& but are the same as the originals on the gadget"
3631,1086,5," Comes in original packaging. Absolutely same as the original ones."
3632,1086,4," Good but took a bit to arrive"
3633,1087,5," Good value works well& delivered in the time window as stated"
3634,1087,4," Delivered in good time& ok for park flying"
3635,1087,4," Good delivery timing. Product pretty good."

3640,1089,3," As described."
3641,1089,5," good stuff"
3642,1090,5," WELL MADEBUT I HAD TO FILE A LARGE BIT OFF BOTTOM TO FIT TO MY DJI TRANSMITTER AS THE HOLE WAS TOO HIGH UPFROM THE BOTTOM NEEDS TO BE CHECKED BY MAKERS ON A DJI TRANSMITTER TO MAKE SURE IT DONT HAPPEN AGAIN"
3643,1090,4," very good for the money"
3644,1090,5," Good item"
3645,1090,4," Good"
3646,1091,5," It is what it is a good replacement"
3647,1092,5," One very happy son. Copter as described. Comment from son and daughter& |sick|&  which is apparently as goods as it gets."
3648,1093,5," As described& great product& good service& prompt delivery as stated"
3649,1094,5," dont bother buying a cheap pull start their no good this is the original thunder tiger pull start and its cheaper than some after market ones"
3650,1094,5," ðŸ‘ðŸ‘thanks"
3651,1095,5," Fits perfectly and is a definite plus from the standard E10 drive shaft. Would recommend buying this before a more powerful motor. :)"
3652,1096,4," getting 6 to 6.5 minutes a battery plus 45 to a minute on lvc warning hope it helps people in deciding to buy as for the 4 in one charger well it did work for 30 mins then all lights stopped thinking they were fully charged i then charged seperatly .all in all i was happy good bargain for ten quid."
3653,1096,3," First set of batteries were faulty. Second set charges and works ok but the charging is a bit temperamental. Have to sometimes unplug and re plug before they charge."
3654,1096,5," Any quadcopter needs spare batteries"
3655,1096,4," All batteries charged properly and quickly.  So far seems fine."
3656,1097,5," Delivered within estimate&very pleased"
3657,1098,5," Perfect. Fits the drone well with the wheels in the compacted position. Great."
3658,1098,5," Good case we'll protected"
3659,1099,5," Really good beginner RC car. Good amount of speed. Handles really really well. Can be modified easily. This is my first RC drift car and very happy with it. will be modding up then selling after learning from modding :)"
3660,1099,5," I haven't personally purchased this car but it is very good it's great for drifting and it's well built if you want to look at some pretty big youtubers have done reviews on it such as RC Sparks Studio. Highly recommend for drifting!!!!!"
3661,1100,5," Purchased this to use as lubricant for my Dayan cubes. Works very well. Very much worth it as I won't need to buy any more anytime soon& plenty of it!"
3662,1100,5," Great for speedcubes! My cubes feel much better now. Better than Maru?"
3663,1101,5," Very quick delivery. Item as described. Having so far only used it for two cycles of charge-use until helicopter cannot maintain height& it seems entirely satisfactory. My impression& without having timed either& is that the duration is somewhat better than the original battery. Bit of a fiddle to solder it the connections but no sweat if you know how to solder. I guess you could maybe just twist the connections if you don't have a soldering iron. Make very sure you don't short the battery terminals (old or new)! Would reorder when this one passes its sell-by date ... if I haven't pranged the helicopter first."
3664,1101,5," All goods come so fast from Amazon & I wonder if they live next door&just fitted 4 new batteries into 2 Yellow& and 2 Red Syma S107 but some spares have to come by boat from China so you may have to be patient these took about 3 weeks& but sometimes they are in stock if you are lucky&so don't get rid of the helicopter &a new battery is easy to fit &and you can be flying again &excellent purchase buy"
3665,1101,4," Replacing the battery in my mini helicopter (not a Syma) after the original one wouldn't hold any charge.My original was 180mah so this was slightly smaller capacity which I wasn't too concerned about.  Oddly its much smaller in physical size but perhaps this could be because the other had 'puffed up' at the end of its life.It seems to power the helicopter ok though - just make sure your soldering skills are up to the job.  The wires in these mini helicopters are incredibly thin so it is a tricky job"
3666,1101,4," Battery works great in my syma s107g& nice to find one thats decent quality& i'm glad i ordered 2 as none of them last forever.Just remember the cooling down period before and after charging to prolong its lifespan.Posted from China& so don't expect delivery for a couple of weeks to the uk."
3667,1101,5," A bit fiddly to solder in place due to the tiny wires& but if you're buying this you're probably expecting that! Easy drop in replacement for my tiny r/c helicopter - higher capacity than the original so longer flying time! Bargain - much better option than binning the helicopter and buying another!"
3668,1101,5," Very slightly longer than the original& weighed less than a gramme more& took photos of original battery in situ and than replaced new battery for old. Helicopter flies fine battery works well."
3669,1101,1," What isn't mentioned is that it's a 15mah rather than a 24mah as per original. Waited 3 weeks for it to be less than original size. This means less time in the air. Be aware of this."
3670,1101,5," Batteries seem like correct part& but not had chance to fit yet. Delivery took the full estimated time& which at a few weeks is quite slow& but no complaints."
3671,1102,4," A nice easy solution if you don't want to go up on the roof and stick something there. It has little holes in the plastic ends and the t junction so it can be pinned to a wall for space saving convenience. The plug for the radio socket is male& same as the radio so it needs a female to female adapter which luckily I had in the |that'll come in handy| drawer. Can't complain at the price though. Comes folded flat so it popped through the letterbox no problem."
3672,1102,5," Bought this because I'd inherited an amp with built-in radio but no aerial. While it's clear that there's what appears to be a young tapeworm emerging from behind a picture in the living room& reception appears to be absolutely fine.Worth noting that it comes with an adaptor so you can actually plug it in (the co-ax on the aerial itself is male& just like the socket on the amp - adaptor fixes this).Very pleased with this purchase& and value for money."
3673,1102,3," Cheap but effective. Bought this to use for a radio in my workshop. Cheapest option I could find and works well. You will need an adapter to get it to plug straight into the back of your radio."
3674,1102,5," item arrived very quickly with free postage so great. does the job so I can now receive clear fm radio stations. Only gripe is that you need a connecter to fit radio so wasn't able to use straight away had to go out and buy one. would help if this was stated in item description to avoid further dissapointment for future purchasers."
3675,1102,5," Fast delivery.When I ordered this I knew that I would have to cut off the male co-axial plug as I needed bare wires to the back of my tuner.What was nice& was that they also sent a small co-ax female connector for those who needed the other type.The aerial has improved reception as well!"
3676,1102,4," We could only get poor FM reception as out in the sticks but now reception is really good& I just have it pinned to the wall behind unit so out of sight& saved me buying and hooking up an exterior FM aerial.give it a try before shelling out on a more expensive option"
3677,1102,4," The aerial does what it is supposed to and being flat is a good idea& but keeping it flat against the wall& eg behind books& takes some patience as it likes to bend around and has plastic as part of the T. Still at this price it is a good aerial."
3678,1102,5," This aerial requires a female-to-female adapter for most tuners& but when fitted does exactly what it is supposed to do - gives a clear FM signal and is unobtrusive to the point of invisibility."
3679,1103,5," Perfect original set of feet."
3680,1103,5," Delivery ok. Original Parrot product. Only used one rubber feet part."
3681,1103,5," bought in error"
3682,1103,1," Overpriced for the name really. I've had parrot products for a while now and thank the Lord there's other drones flooding the market that cost less and don't charge the earth for every tiny extra."
3683,1104,5," Fitted on a Tamiya Grasshopper reissue (with ball bearing upgrade)& this dramatically changed the car!Speed has gone from good to insane (for this car)& as a result you cannot be full throttle anymore& the car would very easily roll over when turning if there's a bump on the road.I had the original Grasshopper when I was a kid& with a standard 540 motors& I don't remember the car going that fast and being so prone to rolling over.I'm working on improving the suspensions to help it cope with the new power& but this is great fun!Only downside is the car now requires some proper driving skills& not fit for my <10 years old kids anymore."
3684,1104,5," Dug the old RC car out the parents loft which still had the stock motor and battery inside it.  Purchased a new battery and seen this motor listed on the upsel Amazon page. Battery came and I relived the boyhood RC car moment again& all good.  Then I though I'd try this for Â£13.  It took a while to come (around 3 weeks) and I swaped it out for stock motor.  It was a straight foward replacement as I had a little trouble with it as the pin is a little shorter than my stock motor. To get around this I put my pinion on the other way around and use a few washers to align the motor with the clutch wheel& which was nice to get the old computer hands dirty a bit.Fired it up and it now shoots like a rocket.  I'd say 30-40% faster! My car even struggles to turn at speed it goes that quick. For Â£13 its worth the wait and the fiddling about to get it on."
3685,1104,5," An excellent product which I have now to fit to my boat.  It is beautifully made and& although it took about a month to arrive& it is well worth the wait.  For the sake of clarity for model makers who will actually use this motor& its |dimensions| given on the Amazon web site are those of the box the motor is packed in"
3686,1104,4," Slotted in place after purchasing a pinion and it just worked. It is much quicker than the silver motor that my grasshopper came with& the take off speed is around the same but top end has improved alot."
3687,1104,5," bought for my tamiya grass hopper& thought it would be about 25% to 50% faster but if anything its twice as fast as stock! took a while to come but for the price im very happy."
3688,1104,5," so i bought this upgrade motor for my midnight pumpkin and before i changed over i thought i would test the difference. I stuck my cycle Garmin to my car and clocked a max speed of 12MPH (with my old motor) i then changed over to the Rs-540 and clocked 16MPH (battery was charged between each trial).It is a faster motor when compared to my original std motor"
3689,1104,5," Good motor. Definitely quicker than the standard silver can. Good price as well. will continue to use until I can afford to go brushless!"
3690,1104,5," Great motor for the money massive upgrade on performance from the standard silver can. Would recommend."
3691,1105,4," ....but that's OK because it's good enough. The neighbours probably think I'm going for trumpet practice when I stick this in the motor and drive off. Little do they know I'm off to the park to fly an X5C1 into some trees or something. It's a good case and everything fits spot on& personally I'd prefer it if the |Hobby Tiger| printed across it wasn't so big. Heavier than I expected (it's not that heavy though!)"
3692,1105,5," Solid sturdy case but lightweight so easy to carry. Foam inner with sections for each part of the drone to store it without breakages. Speedy delivery. RecommendedI purchased this product at a discounted price and was asked to write an unbiased review"
3693,1105,5," *Note - I was sent this product by the seller in return for an honest review*This aluminium rim carrying case is perfect for safely transporting your Syma X5C& X5SC or X5SW drone. Not only does it have room for the drone& but also for the remote& spare batteries and cables. Upon receiving the case& I first noticed how professional and stylish it looks. Inside the case are foam inserts& which are glued in. The inserts prevent your drone and accessories from moving around. Another great thing about the inserts is how deep they are& meaning that you don't have to remove the landing skids from your X5SC or X5SW. I honestly can't thing of any bad things to say about this case."
3694,1106,5," Great deal good quality"
3695,1106,5," great thanks"
3696,1107,5," Really happy with theses. My Rc car case was jumping around like mad until I used these pads. Would recommend :)"
3697,1108,5," Just what I was looking for& a pair of scissors ideal for cutting decals. Sold at a good price and quickly delivered given that they came from Japan."
3698,1108,5," Ideal for what's  required when cutting small decals& well made and good quality."
3699,1108,3," Great scissors but took 5 weeks to make it from Japan =("
3700,1108,5," Excellent little item & cuts decal great."
3701,1109,5," happy"
3702,1110,4," Does what it says on the box& original parts at a real good price.Easy to replace& hours of flight time"
3703,1110,4," Not really much to say& but these are good replacements and therefore happy with the purchase. Came in a kind of retail packaging& which is handy as you can keep them in it rather than having them lose in your pocket."
3704,1110,5," Were delivered fairly quickly and were in Hubsan packaging so looks like the real deal.  Not much else to say& replacement blades that do the same job as the original."
3705,1110,5," Ordered these for my elderly father& who had crashed his helicopter and damaged a few parts. These were an excellent price and arrived in good time"
3706,1110,5," many colours to choose from this seller as they have all the basic components for a quadcopter and even quads them self"
3707,1110,4," for the price they are fine well worth it for the hubsan and fits the ethos qx75 quad as well"
3708,1110,3," Product fine and great price but did not realise they were coming from Hong Kong and they took an age to come. You should&nt have to wait nearly a month for items to arrive in this day and age especially when I got another set delivered from ebay the next day!!"
3709,1110,1," In manufacturers packaging but very flimsy& not the same spec as original white and black props& fly off and or break far& far easier than original white and black& not worth the money& Very poor"
3710,1111,3," ?Park Fly type Aircraft Transmitter? Surface models(Cars. Boats etc.)!.&The first example I received. Purchased new from another reputable online retailer would not Bind to the included Spektrum AR610 Receiver and was replaced as a Defective/Faulty transmitter unit. As this was intended to fly with Outdoor Model Aircraft at my local club. Which for general safety reasons and B.M.F.A. rules and recommendations. only allow use of Full Range transmitters by club members. The second transmitter seems to be working OK and will Bind without problems and can be used with Third-Party receivers in addition to Spektrum units"
3711,1111,5," Excelent product"
3712,1112,5," Thankfully not had to actually fit any of the blades yet but I fly my X5C safe in the knowledge that when the inevitable happens& I can just swap out a rotor straight away. Having the spare battery is fantastic because it gives you so much more flying time between charges."
3713,1112,5," These are probably unnecessary as the Syma X5 comes with spare blades and protectors but the batteries are essential. Arrived within a week from China and good communication from the seller who I recommend."
3714,1112,5," Have not needed to use the blades as the protectors are doing their job"
3715,1112,5," Just as they advertised straight fix onto quad no problem"
3716,1112,4," Had a problem with delivery& apart from that great."
3717,1112,5," Not had the needed to use these yet tbh and when buying the drone it already came with spare blades and guards. However the spare batteries in this pack are a must!!"
3718,1112,4," I bought these for a friend the propellers are good when the old ones break when flying your drone accident happens and always good to have spare parts when needed"
3719,1112,2," Didn't work well for me. As you sent it up it always going towards one direction and does not turn at all what ever you do on the controller."
3720,1113,4," Decent piece of kit However dry batteries are not allowed at our flying club so another 15 quid had to be spent on flight pack.Lacks dedicated cut of button you need to program a switch <Hassle>All in all once you get your head round instruction manual it is a good transmitter feels well made and works well.receivers are a bit expensive a cheaper 6 chanel woud do for a beginner.4 star rating Instructions could be made easier to understand"
3721,1113,5," Excellent"
3722,1114,5," Great& original packing& great contact from seller and amazing quality"
3723,1114,5," Better than the cheap rubbish you get from other places."
3724,1115,4," Very nice helicopter. I love it!"
3725,1116,5," Works perfectly. Bargain at the price I got it..."
3726,1117,5," This is a great product thats well worth the money and makes taking the wheels for your model a dream if you have ever had a to take the wheels off losi micros then your know how hard it is to get the little e clips back on this makes changing for wheels for cleaning your what ever a dream ever person who has a losi micro should buy this performance upgrade it really is that good."
3727,1118,5," Super Fast Delivery. Ordered on a Saturday night and the motors arrived before Monday lunchtime. Should now be able to repair the Q4 after I fat fingered changing the rotor blade pulling the complete motor off the copter!"
3728,1119,5," The Parrot is great. Easy to fly and lots of fun. The spare blades and cogs etc have not been used yet (surprisingly) this is only because there have been no bad crashes yet.The best spare I purcahsed was a battery."
3729,1120,5," Ordered as replacement for a faulty unit& works just fine& good purchase. Will use this site again for my parts."
3730,1120,5," Veryp lesed with product and delivery"
3731,1121,5," This is a genuine Parrot part& very pleased. Delivery was excellent"
3732,1122,4," The blades worked very well with the quadcopter and seem to bend less than the original cheerson blades but the holes on them were slightly smaller than the originals which made them really difficult to fit and one or two didn't go on at all& but once on they are very tough and withstand more crashes than the originals.The prop on the right is the product and the other is the original. Hope this helped :)"
3733,1122,5," Blades fine and blade guard works& unless you crash into a wall at full speed& at which point you may loose 1 or two blades"
3734,1122,5," 5 stars&  product like on picture&Best regardsSebastian"
3735,1122,5," Excellent value for money."
3736,1122,5," No complaints here."
3737,1123,4," Thanks and worth the wait& a great wee maintenance kit for pennies ðŸ˜€"
3738,1123,5," As discribed great replacement parts top class"
3739,1123,5," service good no problems thank you"
3740,1123,4," I love it."
3741,1124,5," Bought to fit on :-Tamiya 53086 Rear Star Dish Wheels&They fit perfectly and are a great addition to the rear of my Tamiya Frog."
3742,1125,5," Our teenage son has been running and racing remote control cars and trucks for years now& and he is fairly rough on his gear. The upside is that the hobby brought out the 'mechanic' in him and that has been amazing to watch.Regular maintenance after every few hours of run time includes break-down& clean and refill of the shocks& and he has tested many different weight shock oils and different strength springs over the years. He is tough on these cars and has built several jumps& so he need the shocks& shock coils and shock oil to really stand up to the punishment. For the last year or so& Losi shock oils have become his favorite as their oils just seems to stand up well for a longer period of time.Depending on weather conditions and the type of running he is planning to do (off-road& pavement speed runs& dirt track racing...)& our son will use different weight shock oils in the car... but his most frequently used oils are 40& 45 and 50 weight. Since he cleans the shock regularly& we typically purchase the larger 4 ounce bottles instead of smaller ones.If you are looking for a good remote control car or truck shock oil& for uses as I have described above& then our son totally recommends that you give Losi Shock Oil a try based on his experience with it. Highly recommended& especially in these more economically priced larger bottles.Go for it"
3743,1126,4," Purchased for my X4 H107L. Flying is much more fun when you have a set of batteries to work with and can keep flying for longer.These seem to be every so slightly thicker than the original battery so can be a bit more fiddly to slide in and out. In all other respects I'm really happy. The charge is small and no-nonsense. Plug in all 6 batteries& attach to USB supply and it charges each until full - with indicator light showing which batteries are done and which still charging."
3744,1126,3," On the first flight with one of these batteries after charging with the supplied charger my Hubsan lost all power without any warning. On inspection the battery had completely failed and puffed up to twice it's original size. This was inside flying and happened after less than 3 minutes.This could just be a faulty battery& these are after all built to a price. I have given 3 stars because of the value for money and because I have not tested the other batteries.Please note you cannot send faulty lipos thought the postal system and they should never be recharged once blown."
3745,1126,5," This is a fantastic product and exactly what i wantedcool"
3746,1126,5," Its good"
3747,1127,5," As described and no issues at all"
3748,1128,5," This piece looks fantastic when displayed! A really good size for those who like larger Lego sets& really good minifigures (even if two of them are droids) - the General Grievous is particularly impressive with his detailed face and his four lightsbares& as well as Count Dooku& who I've never seen in another set yet.In terms of building& is a decently complex and interesting build that should satisfy those who like a challenge (I'd imagine younger children may need some help).In terms of playability& it's not really a set you can swoosh around because it is quite heavy once completed. However& there is a built-in handle on the top& so moving it around is possible& but smaller hands may drop it if it's used for vigorous play. it does have missiles on each side& but I found these to be a bit tricky to operate"
3749,1128,5," My seven year old saved up all his christmas& birthday and pocket money to buy this set and he couldn't be more pleased with it. It is impressively big when it's built and has an integrated carry handle& which makes it easy to move around. The detailing is fabulous and you get a good selection of mini figures with it. It took him two days to build and he managed the vast majority of it on his own. Best lego set we've had so far (and we've had quite a few!)."
3750,1128,5," My 10 year old LOVES this and as with most lego loved assembling it. Especially the handle so he can pick it up safely!"
3751,1128,5," bought this product for my 10 year old sons birthday he loves it wanted it for a long time needs help to build"
3752,1128,5," My son loves it and managed to do it in a few hours so it was perfect for his age - 7.  no regrets!!"
3753,1128,4," This was bought for my lego mad 5 year old sons christmas present after weeks of asking for it& it didn't disappoint! This is a good size ship and looks very impressive when constructed. It has about 1100 pieces and took me a while to build it& it was an enjoyable build and not too repetitive and wasn't the most difficult I have done.  Whilst building it you can't help but be amazed at the detail& the mechanism for the firing cannons on each side is sublime and very very clever! This set has good playability and doesn't break every time you touch it& it has a small handle to allow you to fly it around if you wish. I would recommend this set but wouldn't pay full price for it& it's worth Â£80 it's a long ship has decent mini figures& general grievous looks very cool& the ship looks just as good as a display piece. My son loves the product and plays with it daily so that's good enough for me"
3754,1128,5," Purchased for my son's (7 Years old) Christmas present (from Father Christmas) purchased from Amazon as it was the cheapest around at that time.  Hours of fun building& very easy to build"
3755,1128,5," It's a reasonably large model that's fairly quick and a bit too easy to build for the price. It could do with some more complex sections."
3756,1129,5," This beyblade is really good. It changes the air air currents to make is spin faster. I would only recomend this beyblade to people that have lots of expirence because my friend has this beyblade and it took him a lot of time to master it."
3757,1129,5," it was a gift from my mum so a some I couldn't stop playing with it because every time I win"
3758,1130,5," My grandson loves Lego so bought this for him for his birthday.  He couldn't wait to get started and it was finished the next day"
3759,1130,5," Contrary to some other Lego contraptions& this is very sturdy. The insect looks suitably 'scary'. The legs move when you roll it which again added effect. It took my 7 year old a lot of concentration to do even though he is used to follow Lego instructions. The only minor thing is that he can't throw the eggs very far but that is not necessarily negative from a parent's point of view."
3760,1130,5," Amazing looking Lego creation. Bought it for my grandson and he loved it ! Would recommend it to anyone looking for a great build."
3761,1130,5," Lego never fails to delight!  So many themes to choose from&  Must be the number 1 choice for most kids& old and young!"
3762,1130,5," Excellent lego set. Nice time for buid and Ii s fully fonctionnal. I recommand. He walk same a real insect."
3763,1130,5," My 9 year old son is crazy about Lego. This set is sturdier than some others. We find a lot of the flying machine sets come apart too easily. But this one stays together when he plays with it. As always excellent instructions& excellent quality& and good value for money."
3764,1130,5," Catapult and moving legs are best parts the legs are quite creepy and have realistic movement as crawler pushed across the floor. 10 year old loved building and playing with this"
3765,1130,5," This was a Christmas present for my grandson and he was very happy with it and spent a lot of time building it."
3766,1131,5," Very nice kit& without question the most detailed kit in the cheaper 1/350 range& nice that all underwater inlets are included& rails all present& main deck windows and doors all there& the other 1/350 Bismarck built but another leading model maker is missing all that detail& also main deck is a single sheet& this is a nice feature as no sanding down to try and get the decks flush& excellent detail in the decking& nice decal sheet& also good painting guide& only critisism is had a bit of difficulty fitting to main deck to the hull on the port bow& just did not fit perfectly& overall a pleasure to build and look at - I would recommend to anyone"
3767,1131,5," As you can expect with Revell products it's realy nice to make but has some flaws here and there& but nothing you can not fix with a bit of work. I aint building it like the box says but with some PE and lighting in it& this kit is ideal for doing this as you have so much space for it all.Arived well in time and was good packaged& but the kit had one part that was broken& still looking into getting a replacement for it.Would recoment using PE for the extra details."
3768,1131,5," Very good example of the Bismarck with excellent detail but I wish all model manufactures would supply single part hulls& apart from that I am going to enjoy putting this together. Revell are still amongst the best."
3769,1131,5," Arrived bang on the button& a huge box but it arrived intact without damage. Almost 1000 parts so it will take some time to complete. It is very detailed and I'm enjoying every minute of the challenge."
3770,1131,5," Super value model. very nicely detailed. Fairly long build on this model as there's a lot of parts but the finished ship looks really amazing"
3771,1131,5," Very well detailed &parts fit together easy. A big project to keep you busy if you have time."
3772,1132,4," Not built to the same quality as lego but still a great little toy that my son loved. The seller was excellent."
3773,1132,3," Lots of fun for the price& but the manufacturing quality isn't a patch on Lego."
3774,1132,5," Perfect product."
3775,1133,5," I initially bought three of these& one for myself which always travels in my main coat pocket&"
3776,1133,5," Fantastic product for my bug mad children ! I am forever taking pots"
3777,1133,4," Fantastic for the budding bug hunter to take camping. Small and easy to transport. The zipped opening can sometimes be a little tricky for small hands. Would benefit from a larger panel for viewing clearly."
3778,1133,4," Amazon insists I review this as a toy which is silly because it's not& it's really a portable cage for bugs which is very useful and packs down into a nice compact size& there's a zipped opening on top for putting in the bugs (and getting them out!) and is useful on bughunts with your kids& moth trapping events and such-like. Overall a good product but not a toy."
3779,1134,5," This is one of the Friends Animals 4th set release - the grouping for this release are a tiger cub& a purple turtle and this cute little penguin.|Pengie| (real name |Casper|!) looks a little grumpy - even the bow doesn't seem to help his/her mood.  It may be that Pengie would have preferred a bow that matched the colouring of his playground build.  Grumpy or not (s)he is still a little cutie.Penguin has a fish for his lunch ... but the silver colour fish is bigger than Pengie him/herself.The playground build is very nice and there is an alternative build (instructions available on Lego's site) which looks like |Pengie| is standing outside the front door of his ice mansion.  Both builds are& in my opinion& quite attractive and look good on the shelf next to the other Friends Animals' builds.Penguin's build has a RRP of 2.99 for 43 pieces giving a price per piece of 6.95 pence."
3780,1134,5," A costly series of toys for the buyer& but the Grandchildren love them.  I will probably continue to buy under pleasant duress."
3781,1134,5," Great little buy.  My 6 year daughter loved putting it together all by herself.  The lego friends collection is just brilliant.  Arrived quick and well packaged - thank you"
3782,1134,5," A lovely little gift. Worth a couple of pounds. The girly lego range in general is good and long awaited."
3783,1134,5," Great thanks"
3784,1135,5," I got this in the Black Friday sale last christmas for a 4 year old who is well into Toy Story.In the classic toy soldier army green colour you get the army jeep and four soldiers. A medic with doctors case& mine detection guy with a metal detector& a rifleman with gun and communications chap who carries one of those big walkie talkies with the long antenna as seen in many a vietnam movie!The jeep is buildable and the men have little bases that they can be stuck onto! All in all a good little set supplied in a disney/toy story branded box that may even become collectable if you buy and don't open it!"
3785,1135,4," I used this as part of table 'activity bags' for our wedding and they kept 80 adults very occupied! And were all taken home for the children to enjoy afterwards!"
3786,1135,5," Lego is great - but Toy Story Army Men on Patrol is  'out of hand' is a great little set.  Didnt take that long to build but it looks brilliant when made up& you can also remove the little platforms on the base of the soldiers& so you can put them in the jeep etc. Hardcore Lego/Toy Story fans wont be disappointed :D"
3787,1135,3," I bought this for my son during Amazons deals just before Christmas so it didn't get opened until Christmas day but I was disappointed when it arrived anyway. For some reason I was expecting a little more than what it was and to be honest on Christmas day my son didn't seem very impressed with this either. Have a look around and spend your money on something better :)"
3788,1135,5," My brother got really into lego coming up to christmas so as a larst minuit buy & i brought this and it arrived really quickly & it was the only presant he played with on christmas day cause he changed his mind and wanted nothing but lego at the larst minuit!"
3789,1136,5," I cannot recommend this toy highly enough for little girls aged two to three. It proved an absolute hit with my little daughter this christmas. She absolutely loved it.She got great fun dressing up the princess and& along the way& learned her colours and new words such as tiara& sleeves& skirt& top etc.Like others who have reviewed this toy before& I thought it a shame that the lid for the box in which the pieces are kept is made of throw-away plastic. However& we simply popped the princess and her various pieces of clothes into a string bag and our daughter carried them with her....to grand-parents& friends& playgroup& everywhere!And& from our perspective& it was a much welcome alternative to the iphone as a means of keeping her amused when we ate out over the christmas holidays."
3790,1136,4," I bought this for my daughter and (aged 4 at the time)& it is 'right up her street'& she can sit for hours making up different combinations of outfits for her princess& the magnets are strong enough not to slip and the pieces chunky and durable. So far we have managed to keep all the 'bits' which can be a problem with some toys however I really think that the storage box could have been better designed - a lid would really help !"
3791,1136,5," My daughter got this for her 3rd birthday and loves it.  It is really good quality and she really enjoys mixing and matching the different clothes to dress up the princess.  The only disappointment is that there is no lid with it so it is very easy to lose pieces."
3792,1137,5," Bought this as a present for my 2 year old& he absolute loved it& his slightly older brother loved it aswell. Defiantly worth buying& converts really easily."
3793,1137,5," My 3 year old son loves this! Was a bit unsure as it was so cheap but he thinks it is great! Definitely worth the money"
3794,1137,5," I bought this at the sale price and it was great value for money. My grandson Cameron (2) loves it& and took great pride in showing his grandad and dad how to work it. Excellent for keeping in the car for long journeys."
3795,1137,5," I bought this toy for my two year old Grandson&who absolutely loves it&what a clever piece of kit.I would definately go out and buy another one.One very happy little boy."
3796,1138,5," This is probably the most durable motor vehicle that my son owns.  He absolutely loves it.  It's a lot larger than we thought it would be too.  It can easily be used to move conkers or building blocks around the room.  I'm going to look at more toys by the same makers.  Let's just say I've been really impressed."
3797,1138,5," As with all the Bruder purchases ive made& i rate these very durable and detailed toys& keeps my 3yr old boy amused with this and other Bruder toys every day before or after school& or both if he could. This toy along with other Bruder toys has my recommendations for its toughness|cost|lifelike and child friendlyness& these toys are the modern day T***a toy& that I played with as a kid"
3798,1138,5," This is a brilliant toy. My son was bought one for his first Christmas three years ago and he plays with it all the time. It has withstood been dropped down the stairs& left out in rain and being tripped up over numerous times and its still going strong.The only damage it has recievd in three years is one of the handles on the front of the cab has snapped off& which isn't bad considering how much its been played with.This has been a huge hit in our house and has kept my son and his friends busy for hours loading up bricks& toy cows& etc. It is also a realistic model of the original& with even replica gears inside the cab.Definately worth the money."
3799,1138,5," Having read all the reviews on diggers and dumpers etc. I decided on this one. And as all the reviews say it is robust and no sharp corners. Can be used outside or inside. Big enough to load duplo bricks in and chug around. Just brilliant. Need some more in this make"
3800,1138,5," Same as above. So good in fact I purchased a much bigger pat loader as these toys are made very well and will stand up to any child 2 years and older."
3801,1138,5," bought this for my 2 year old - very well made toy& very sturdy. definetly a good addition to his collection!"
3802,1138,5," quite a sturdy toy. can be used without too much fear of being broken. it is made of plastic not metal and is a lot of fun to play with"
3803,1138,5," As a mom I appreciate the good quality& child friendly design. My 2yr old loves it. Actually it's been his favourite toy since arrival ca month ago."
3804,1139,5," Brilliant scientific toy for children and it really works!"
3805,1139,5," Works well& great fun!"
3806,1139,5," Bought as a present.  I think the adults enjoyed making it just as much as the kids!"
3807,1139,5," works great! also works with potatoes& oranges and carrots!"
3808,1139,3," Very good for kids interesting in science"
3809,1139,4," item as advertised and delivered quickly"
3810,1139,2," This was flimsy and difficult to set.  It was a sticking filler for my son and whilst he loved the idea it was not something he was able to set up as it was fiddly and temperamental."
3811,1140,5," our grandchild enjoyed it&"
3812,1141,5," It's really just 20 light sabers. My seven year old kid loves them but& unfortunately& they are very small and he looses them sometimes. I bought these to replace some missing weapons. He loved them!!!"
3813,1142,3," as there are so many different types of clockmovements I took a bit of a risk ordering online. As I thought& the movement didnt fit my clockface. the diameter of the shaft was too big. And my old hands didnt fit either. But delivery of this product was speedy and refund wasnt a problem either."
3814,1142,4," This replacement clock mechanism was perfect for me as it has straight sides on the spindles which fitted the ornate hands from my broken clock. I don't know why it's listed as a toy. Requires 1 AA battery. This one does not include hands& even the sweep second hand is separate& and it works out a bit expensive once you have bought mechanism& hands and second hand separately and paid for postage on each item. Suggestion to seller& offer these items as a bundle with just one postage charge.There is a cheaper alternative available from Battery Planet at Amazon with plain black hands and a red second sweep hand included."
3815,1142,2," As with others& bought to replace a broken mechanism.Have to say& I felt that the P"
3816,1142,5," Exact replacement"
3817,1142,5," This was cheap& it mended the wife's favourite wall clock in the kitchen& was easy to fit and works well& what more do you need from a clock mechanism."
3818,1142,4," good buy& great to have the clock functioning again along with the new hands set and replacement batteries.  good time keeping to"
3819,1142,1," Not as described. I asked for long shaft this wasn't sufficient. Waste of money for me. Movement ok but that is all.."
3820,1142,3," got this thinking it would work with my clock& unfortunatley got the wrong size so had to return it pitty."
3821,1143,5," fantastic now the kids can play till their hearts content as the light sabers that come with the lego always get lost"
3822,1143,5," My son was extremely happy with this purchase"
3823,1143,5," Excellent"
3824,1144,5," Brilliant!"
3825,1145,5," amazing....just like the photo of it! I'm really glad I looked before I purchased this& otherwise who knows what I could have bought."
3826,1145,5," Great price& slick Order process& arrived promptly& made a great xmas gift. Well done Amazon& you made Xmas shopping easy this year."
3827,1145,4," a must for any star wars lego fan"
3828,1146,5," good value& increased my collection of matchstick models"
3829,1146,5," nice kit with clear and plain instructionsDS"
3830,1146,5," This is a present hope it looks good built"
3831,1146,5," Impressive model"
3832,1146,5," OK"
3833,1147,5," incredible poker set for this money. Had a lot of trouble finding anything descent& never mind the step up in quality i was looking for. The set delivered on all fronts. Chips are bright and vibrant& which looks amazing on the table& and are all inlayed NO stickers!! If you want a poker set thats better than most available on the market& if you want coming that looks and feels quaility and if you only want to pay around Â£60& this is the percent set"
3834,1147,5," Used this for a friends poker night at my flat. They commented about how good they look& with one saying the chips are really professional with a great weight. Didn't use the cards as bought some other ones that I liked the look of better. The box is solid as anything and feels like it could withstand an artillery barrage - the whole set should last a lifetime depending on how much you use them. Well worth spending a few quid more for an item of this quality."
3835,1147,5," Quality poker set. I have a few sets but this set is by far the best."
3836,1147,5," Great chips. Everyone commented on the quality."
3837,1148,5," Refreshingly difficult to make but all the more pleasurable for it - so many things are designed to be so easy they're downright boring. More insects please!"
3838,1148,5," Exelent model looks exelent"
3839,1148,5," Amazingly fun to build."
3840,1149,5," Like many fans I couldn't wait to see what the new Lego Star Wars had in store& so rushed out and bought this on Saturday. Faced with a choice of what to buy& I plumped for this one because I already had an X -Wing& Tie Fighter and Millenium Falcon& so even I couldn't justify paying not an inconsiderable amount for what is& essentially& some new mini-figures. Having said that& I was really happy with the number of mini figures you got with this set - 7 in total - which is quite a lot in comparison with other sets of a similar price.The build itself was pretty straightforward - it took my 7 yr old son and I about 2 hours to complete. There are some good features like the drop down front door and pop up seat for the gunner and I like the way the roof comes off to give access to the ship itself. The new stormtroopers are pretty cool - I like the new style helmets with the added bonus of a metallic Captain Phasma. Am already counting days to the next payday to get my next set."
3841,1149,5," Great model& but made even better with a few extra spare parts. I'm a fussy so and so and swapped out some black parts for dark bley/light bley. Its a big lump but I like the WWII landing craft overtones. Not a fan of the flick missiles in this context. On the AT-DP they seemed right& here less so. Also as per the snowspeeder the minifigs are trez cool. Actually& check that& the rebels are lame but if history tells us anything it's the bad guys that are always best dressed!"
3842,1149,4," This has to be up there with the most surprisingly enjoyable build of the new sets from the Force Awakens& and with several of them being new versions of similar sets (millennium falcon and X-wing) this is by far the most unique.The main draw to the set is the incredibly detailed Minifigures. Captain Phasma and the Flame troopers are really special& although the bland appearance of the resistance is a shame. Although the bad guys always look better. The build itself is fun and enjoyable& without ever being too tricky for younger Lego fans. The addition of wheels& although inaccurate to the film l& adds a bit of playfulness to the set. Great set& price is slightly higher than I would initially expect to pay but it does work out at roughly 0.10p per brick. Would recommend"
3843,1149,4," This is a great set. Looks plain on the box but well worth buying whether you are a collector or buying it to play with. Firstly I don't usually comment on the packaging or products but I like the newer thin box that this model comes in& it feels a bit less wasteful than some older Lego boxes. Also liked the more compact instruction booklet.Okay& the minifigures: This model is going for a massive discount on eBay without the figures& so are they worth it? Well they are amazing. It's rare to get a Lego Star Wars set where every figure gets it right and this is one of the few exceptions. All the figures are well detailed& I love the new Stormtrooper helmets and the flamethrowing gear is really cool. Captain Phasma is great and stands out next to other minifigures in a display. Warning: Captain Phasma has a black headpiece like the old stormtroopers. I understand Disney wants to preserve the secrecy around the new films but it's not like we don't all know what Gwendoline Christie looks like!The transporter itself is a fun build. It's not a big model but it is bigger than I expected when I started building it with great details on the engines. Definitely reminiscent of WWII beach assault craft. The playability is great& with spaces for a pilot and gunner operating stud-guns and a removable roof so you can position your troops inside. For a collector with a few stormtroopers it looks amazing having them gush out of the landing ramp and charging into battle. The model also has a fairly solid construction& although the forward hatch is prone to falling open if held the wrong way& I would have liked a better mechanism for keeping it shut.All in all this is a great set and a worthy addition to your Star Wars collection.Read more â€º"
3844,1149,5," Detailed& interesting and functional& Star Wars Lego never fails to disappoint the customers. A lot of effort has gone in to designing this and it shows in the detail of the build& with plenty of fiddly bits while building your end up with a sturdy play or display piece. From functioning doors and weapons to the hidden wheels under the ship to make for floor play this is a definite recommendation for any Lego or Star Wars fan. including a variation of interesting characters this set is a wonderful start up point or addition to your First Order Army. If the superhero Lego lines were as robust and detailed as this I would be over the moon."
3845,1149,5," pricey but worth it"
3846,1149,5," Excellent item& v happy boy& thank you"
3847,1149,5," Another great Lego set. Really enjoyed the build with my boy helping. It's more than a lump of grey& with good play features and a great selection of mini figures."
3848,1150,5," My Snitch just arrived.Very pleased with it. Just what was described and shown .Everyone that has seen it loves it.Just ordered 3 more to give away to friends.One friend described it  ( its a beautiful thing )"
3849,1150,5," Didn't take too long to get here& I wasn't expecting it to arrive the next day& so if you're buying it as a gift& keep in mind that the shipping takes around 1/2 weeks. It came in a nice velvet drawstring bag and wasn't damaged at all. The chain is rough& don't expect amazing quality due to it's cheap price& but since this was a gift& this was a nice gift that is expensive& and you can always use it as as a pocket watch. Just be careful when handling it& do not be so heavy handed with it. But I like it& and it's a nice gift for a friend& who loves Harry Potter."
3850,1150,5," Awesome! Love it and I think my friend will love it too! Also& love the little box& wish more people did that."
3851,1150,3," Took a long time to come. Arrived long after Christmas.My daughter loves it but the chain broke the first time she wore it. I have managed to mend it though."
3852,1150,5," I am actually really suprised that something at this price was of such good quality. I was worried this would be a cheap plastic kids toy& but as it was inexpensive& I bought one as a present.It's really quite good. To clarify& it IS all made of metal. The wings are separate from the orb& but the orb has a quality hinge& and the clock actually works! I was not expecting the watch to actually work as I thought it was a purely fashion item.I have read in other reviews that the chain has broken& luckily nothing has happened yet& however the chain does feel a tad flimsy. So just be cautious.(Side note: I think it was dispatched from East Asia& so it may take longer than a few days to arrive)."
3853,1150,5," Took a while to arrive but worth the wait. I've purchased this for my nephew for christmas as he is an avid Harry Potter fan.. He is reading the books a second time round! The product is very small but cute and in fully working order. I know my nephew will love it as I want one myself! It comes in a small velvet looking pouch which will make the christmas present opening even more exciting for 8 year olds! It looks like an piece of jewellery as opposed to a toy for a kid. Very happy and highly recommend for any HP lovers out there."
3854,1150,5," Such great value for an item that is so darn cute. My friend loved it and it looks like a beautiful vintage piece."
3855,1150,4," Arrive before said date.  Pack simply to keep cost down.  watch working well. Item slightly larger that I thought& so rather imposing on a nine year old."
3856,1151,5," All good."
3857,1152,5," Don't get me wrong& I also love Superquick kits but for ease of assembly and realism& Metcalfe models take the biscuit and are worth the extra money. I now have 4 of this model and many other kits from the Metcalfe range."
3858,1152,5," Those into railway modelling will be aware of the high standards set by this product - easy to set up but sometimes needs weathering"
3859,1152,5," My husband has now made a few of these houses and finds them easy to follow and they look really good"
3860,1152,5," A bit fiddly to put together& but the finished product looks great."
3861,1152,1," too difficult to put together and time consuming"
3862,1153,5," My 27 year old brother loved this gift. He managed to assemble it quickly ( he is a Lego veteran!) and was looking forward to trying out the alternatives when he got home. Good value for money as there are three designs."
3863,1154,5," This is one of the newer lego releases out& having done to death the usual sets I decided to pick this up for my son (with his now pretty massive) Lego collection. He has a few Star wars sets but not that much.The Jedi Interceptor is a fairly straight forward build& quite suited to 5-8/9 year olds or older. What I like about this set is you get R2-D2 (always worth having him) and Anakin Skywalker so two play figures in addition to the Interceptor (he's collecting figures too)Play wise it's quite good for kids"
3864,1154,4," My son (9 yrs) loves this and anything star wars! Anakins fighter complete with R2D2? - it doesn't get much better than that!The kit was only mildly challenging& and my son enjoyed putting it together himself.It has the usual Lego pictorial instructions& and certainly suitable for the age bracket.This one is particularly good in the new range because it comes with two main characters. Loads of play value!"
3865,1154,5," Apparently this was one of the best birthday presents ever. She thoroughly loved every second of assembling the Lego Star Wars Jedi Interceptor& R2D2 and Anakin Skywalker that came with it. The laser shooter was also very satisfactory. his is a great addition to any Star Wars enthusiast's collection!"
3866,1154,4," I bought this as a gift for my grandson for christmas&  and I have been told that he has not stopped playing with it"
3867,1154,5," It's LEGO& not much that can go wrong there in terms of quality. My only objection is that this set is in no way suitable for the average 7 year old. I'm very keen on building LEGO myself and I never have any problems building any of their other sets. Even the larger sets give me no issues. This set however baffled not only my 6&5 year old but myself also. If you're buying this for a 7 year old& make sure they're either very enapt LEGO builders or be sure that you don't mind helping out. Once built it doesn't come apart quickly. There is a little slot where R2D2 can sit in the wing& that's proven a huge hit."
3868,1154,5," My six years old should be the one writing this review. He was waiting for the interceptor for a long time& and when this day finally came& he was so happy& especially with R2D2!!!!!"
3869,1154,5," Fantastic product& speedy delivery. My son was so happy when it arrived he wouldn't stop jumping around the room - thank you"
3870,1154,5," Fast delivery great product that my 7 year old loves to play with. Love Lego star wars products. Would recommend."
3871,1155,5," This is certainly a fun set for children and Star Wars fans.  You get here the Speeder for use to fly into battles& two Shadow Guards and two Shadow Stormtroopers.The Shadow Guards both come with light saber staffs ready to take on any foes& and then with the Speeder and the two Shadow Stormtroopers back up can be called upon as the Speeder has two flick style missiles and the troopers both carry stud blasters.  Along with this you also get more ammunition for the stud blasters so you are ready to battle away.In all this is a relatively quick kit to put together that is sure to give your children hours of fun.  The recommended age range for this is 6-12 years old."

3873,1155,5," Another set for the collection! Great price for this set. My son loved the grey troopers and also the shadow troopers. The build is good as well& quite simple but for this price that's what is expected. Highly recommended. I think these sets are good value for money for the Lego Star Wars fans."
3874,1155,5," Extremely pleased with this set for what you pay it is very good you get a lot in the box bought for my son who enjoyed putting it together with his father quick delivery packed well highly recommended."
3875,1155,5," Lego Shadow (Storm)Troopers and Shadow Guards... who wouldn't want them! These are great minifigures with a lot of detail. The speeder is very nicely designed and satisfying to build. All in all& this is a great set for any fan of Lego Star Wars."
3876,1155,3," good item but very small box! was expecting itto be bigger than what it was. Dispatch and delivery was also very slow - made  birthday presnt late"
3877,1155,5," Good little model and not that hard to build (Son of 5 managed it) couple of nice characters shame that the bigger kits do get expensive."
3878,1155,5," This was a present for my nephew and he informs me he loved it â˜ºï¸"
3879,1156,5," Bought for my 15 year old daughter& yes 15!! She wanted one for her birthday as uts the cool thing now apparently. Thanks"
3880,1157,4," I got this of ebay but its still pretty much the same.it got here on monday & in April it was a raelly good set apart from the silver funnel was missing.I find thept droids a bt funny& anakins flag could have some tools but then again you could get some from the other two flags.all three podracers look good when finished.subobas podracer is a bit heavy& but i dont mind.overall my score is 9/10.by liam moore"
3881,1158,4," My son loved this - it is a great vehicle& has not fallen apart when playing with it and comes with JarJar Binks."
3882,1158,5," bigger than expected but quite easy to assmble. 7 year old grandson loved it."
3883,1158,4," My nine year-old grandson completed it in 45 minutes!"
3884,1158,5," Fantastic!"
3885,1158,5," Fast delivery and very pleased with item"
3886,1158,5," Great idea great seller would buy again"
3887,1158,5," A great Lego Star Wars addition. Our 9 year old son built this in a couple of hours and not its proudly displayed along with the rest in his bedroom."
3888,1158,5," great"
3889,1159,5," .Latest intelligence& from Rebel spies deep within Imperial Space confirm that Elite units of the First Order Tie fighter pilots have exclusive access to specialised craft. In the form of a two-seater TIE craft& supplied with superior weapons and new sensor systems. As a former arm chair general& my nephew and I wanted to see how much of a threat these weapons are going to be. Will the new Tie fighter be a â€œgame changerâ€?This is the latest incarnation of the imperial tie fighter from the forth coming episode 7"
3890,1160,5," Ideal excellent"
3891,1161,5," Our son is struggling at school and so we have decided as a family to continue educating him throughout the summer holidays.  This was a real dilemma as we wanted to make it fun but not too much fun that he strayed off the subject - MATHS!  While we could have used 'Lego' this would have been too tempting for our easily distracted 6 year old: so we thought about what we could use. When at school ourselves my husband and I remembered 1 cm cubes that could be collated& stacked and built with and so we looked for the same and came across the 'Learning Resources Snap Cubes'.  We thought about value and bought the large pack of 500 and when they arrived we were not disappointed& even though they were not exactly the same as the ones we used to use ourselves (reminiscence) they are the next best thing& as they are so much more versatile than the boring old ones we had.We set to using them and found they could be turned into cubes& stacked and best of all easily used by our son to count with because of the bright colours.  He has already learned his two times table (and enjoyed it)& we are now tackling the 3's.  We have a box of resources for learning but these are the resource tool of choice for all the children that visit& they love them and don't realise they are learning (of course with guidance)."
3892,1161,5," My son is having a some difficulty with Numeracy/Maths in Primary School. I was looking for a way to help teach him at home. These cubes are an excellent idea& because he tends to learn well with visual hands on aids. It is one thing to add numbers in black and white on a page and another to see those numbers add up or be reduced in a real life setting. The only negative thing I can mention is the fact the cubes are sometimes awkward to get on and off. My son unfortunately would rather play games with them. Pseudo Lego."
3893,1161,4," My daughter used to have trouble in reception and year 1 with adding and subtracting and number bonds& so I bought these remembering them from my school days. Unfortunately& these aren't the exact same product used in schools& as the quality isn't as good& but for home use they are pretty good value and really help your child to visualise how much 10& 20 or 100 etc. is. Also helps with 10s and units.They can sometimes be a bit hard to disconnect from each other& and some are too loose when they connect together. Also& the ones I remember had a distinctly satisfying |click| - these don't have that.The only thing I would suggest is& for one child& you probably wouldn't need 500 - as that's way too much. 100 is perfectly enough if you can buy it separately. If not& maybe split it with a friend."
3894,1161,5," Very good resource with youngsters or with low performing middle school students. I would recommend it to teachers and parents"
3895,1161,5," lovely and arrived swiftly"
3896,1162,5," This is a colourful and creative toy for children to build and play with. Hours on end can be spent in the living room& bedroom or the playroom with this magnificent design from Lego. You can follow the instructions or build a design your own. It's brilliant! I will highly recommend this product to everyone I know& I've never seen anything like it. I knew the Harry Potter lego would be good but this is just fantastic!  I like this product so much because it brings the story to life. Up till you could only imagine the building of Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry& but now there's no need to imagine& it's here for real! You will be lost in the dream world of Harry Potter for hours while playing with the lego building. As well as developing imagination it will develope concentration skills& and encourage children to read the books.  Personaly I would like all of the Harry Potter lego because I think it's great& I think children of all ages will get a lot of pleasure out of the products& some more than others. If children haven't yet read all of the books& this creation should encourage them to read them. I think this because lego brings out the fun side of reading&you could read a chapter and then make the lego characters act it out! The lego will turn the magic into more magic. The imagination and creativity will live on and on and on forever!"
3897,1162,5," Most of the Harry Potter merchandise seems poorly thought out and just a chance to cash in on the craze - but not the Lego toys!This toy is wonderfully thought out& with many features to keep the little ones happy. On opening the box you find each section of the castle individually bagged. This prevents the kit from being overwhelming and makes it achievable for kids. Their imagination can run riot with this one and most of the main characters are included& so they can recreate their favourite stories with ease.I can't recommend this one highly enough - definitely THE Lego kit to get this Christmas"
3898,1162,5," With huge reluctance and a fair amount of moaning about the expense I bought this set last Christmas for my 8 year old. Its been a very long time since I played with LEGO but after 2hours constructing the castle on Christmas day I am not sure who the present was for.  I have to say that I think my son would have got frustrated trying to build it himself but once built both he and my 5 yr old have had huge amounts of fun playing with the characters and making up their own stories in their head.I knew we were onto a winner when the hyper active 5 yr old with a short attention span was stealing owls and figures to play in his own room.  Since then we have bought various add ons and a year later the kids are still far from bored.  Not surprisingly they want more LEGO this year.  I am happy to say that I wont complain about the price this year.  I think it is an excellent toy& very well thought out and unlike most& one which the kids play with over and over.  When there are so few toys now that actually require kids to use their imagination its nice to find one that does.  I cant recommend this enough"
3899,1162,5," James took less than two hours to make the set up and he has just gone eight. However the magic begins when you start playing with the finished item and re live the book using the props. The gimmics e.g. the moving staircase are well thought out."
3900,1163,4," This is great& works like a real camera& is small but great for children. Just plug it into laptop to view photos. Great present."
3901,1163,5," Super little camera for children"
3902,1164,4," I bought this for my 4 year old& a bit young perhaps but he loves buzz& plus I know my older son of 14 loves Lego so would help him build it.  They both sat and put it together on Boxing day& even my 4 year old put some pieces together when his brother showed him where they went& they had a great time.However obviously my 4 year old wants to play with it& but as I have read before it does fall apart easily and as he doesn't know where the parts go he has to hassle his older brother to put it back together and I think he's now getting fed up.So to build was great& to play with not so much.  I've talked him into putting it on display and playing with his other toy buzz's that won't fall apart.Good kit though."
3903,1164,5," What's better than a Buzz Lightyear toy?What's better than a Buzz Lightyear toy& made of LEGO?Short answer: Nothing!I'm a lover of LEGO& always have been& always will be. It's a great toy for building all things small and large& and this Buzz Lightyear is definitely large!The detail is fantastic& (he only has half a helmet though& there is no bit folded inside)& it comes with plenty of pieces& an would take an amateur about 30mins to build by following the instructions. It's a fantastic copy of the actual Buzz Lightyear.The wings can be folded away& and his head& arms and legs can all be moved. The playability factor for a child would be extremely high (bar the fact of LEGO regularly falling apart with too much use!).Overall: Fan of Toy Story? Fan of LEGO? This is a great addition to any collection& an extremely large model& a very fair price!"
3904,1164,5," Bought this for my partner who is a big Toy Story fan.  I wanted to get them something different to the normal Buzz figure& and this was definitely it& kept them occupied for ages building it& and the finished result is awesome!!Worth the money!! and cheapest on here!"
3905,1165,4," Really good quality (strong thick cards) and delivered on time!! My son is so thrilled with them!"
3906,1166,5," Fab& my lad loves it."
3907,1167,5," Brilliant service from the seller and super fast delivery. The cards were protected well and in mint condition.The cards themselves are actually a rare set& limited to just 380 sets. They feature cast shots from each season with a little synopsis of the season."
3908,1168,5," Bought these for my niece for Christmas as she is shopkins mad. She will love these. Fast delivery."
3909,1169,5," My 8 year old grandson was very pleased with these as an extra stocking filler present. I have no idea what you do with them & but he loved them."
3910,1170,4," Well& I've been playing Magic: The Gathering for a few years now& but I've never been particularly serious about it. I remember from my early days& though& that a friend of mine had a |Sliver| deck which was feared by everybody else in our gaming circle. After a couple of years without touching it& I picked the game back up& and immediately thought back to that friend.Slivers are strange& snake-like creatures with sharp beaks and claws& and they work in a fascinating way. Every Sliver has a unique ability& which is given to any other Sliver creature in play. This means that what one Sliver can do& all of them can.In terms of gameplay& this lets you defeat an ill-prepared opponent in a few moves due to the unexpected swarming effect. After testing the deck (Straight from the box with no alterations made to the deck composition) against a few friends& I learned that it is only effective as-is against people who haven't customised and specialised their own decks.If you want to use this deck fiercely and competitively& I don't recommend using it straight out of the packet& and instead really advise you pick and mix your cards& swapping a few of the less useful ones out for cards you consider more valuable. If you're looking for a less intense and more dramatic game with other casually inclined friends& you can use it as it comes. Either way& you'll get your money's worth.Now& moving away from the gameplay aspect& the product itself is fantastically presented. It comes with a 20-sided dice which can (And I imagine is supposed to) be used as a life counter& but I've also been using it in roleplaying games. So& that's a good point - It comes with something that has many uses.Read more â€º"
3911,1170,4," Was very pleased with the deck& the cards look really nice and you get a 20-sided dice included with the product.The deck itself is well balanced and can be played out of the box& however in an attempt to get as many different Slivers as possible there are a few cards in the deck which can be replaced with same-cost cards which are more useful."
3912,1171,5," Textured metallic surface on one side& in shades of bronze& silver& gold& brass. I have used them for packing tape transfers& acrylic and mixed media. Jackson's Art Supplies have a good selection of other ATC's at reasonable prices."
3913,1172,5," Great"
3914,1173,4," My son was pleased with these cards& good choice."
3915,1173,5," These are for my sons birthday& which he will be so pleased with"
3916,1174,5," I have recently started to play magic again after many years. I got rid of all my old cards and had to start buying them again. This set is a great way to start a collection and has helpful advice on how to play and how best to deck build. contains a great deal of land cards too& which is a massive help to new starters. Highly recommended and at a great price too!"
3917,1174,5," A great starter set for beginning Magic the Gathering (MTG) players like myself.It forces you to look into the strengths of each colour and gives you a nice guide as to what the different plans for a deck are.If you want to make really good decks& however& I would buy some extra packs of cards& or go to your local MTG store for individuals."
3918,1174,5," I recently just got into Magic the Gathering and decided to buy this pack& you get a great selection of 258 cards! You get plenty of each type of land which is essential for building a deck. In the pack you also get a good selection of monsters that workwell with each other& there is a lack of powerful monsters but you might get lucky with the 4 booster packs which are usually Â£4 each anyway. The value is  astounding& i am so happy with what i got for this amount of money and this has set me up nicely to build a great deck& i even got a legendary card in one of the booster packs that were included. I would highly recommend this for anyone who wants to start the game& you cannot go wrong with this!"
3919,1174,5," I recently bought this for myself and my partner& and there was more than enough cards to allow a game between two& with the cards found within.Plenty of variety and rarer cards& as well as at least 20 + land cards for Blue /Black/ White / Red and Green. Also contained 4 x Evolving Wilds cards to allow for easier mixed deck play.Builder Toolkit is exactly what it sounds like& and whether you are starting off in playing the game or an established player& the contents of this deck will go a long way to expanding the possibilities of your gaming.A NOTE FOR NEW PLAYERS : This game can be a little daunting at first and comes with a learning curve& but all the help you will need is in this kit.Have fun and Enjoy!"
3920,1174,5," I'm a very new player to Magic. I have only played a few games against a friend who is also new to the game. I saw this and thought it may help with the deck building side of things.The box is very nice and well made& and capable of holding 500+ cards in my view.I received some very nice mythic rares& 4 x revolving winds and several foil cards.I enjoyed reading the deck building guide. As a new player& it helped to make sense of what you aim to do and names some decks you may want to look at.Overall a very good buy& and thoroughly recommend."
3921,1174,5," Wanna know how marketing works? Let me tell you a short story:I paid around 4 pounds and bought the steam game Magic The Gathing: Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013 during a steam sale (it was discounted and usually costs around twice as much). When playing the game& an ingame ad popped up advertising the 2013 Deckbuilder's Toolkit and briefly describing what it was all about: |285 cards - an instant collection|. I was sold.See& I began collecting Magic around the age of 11 (that was back in 2002) for about 2 years and then stopped because my school friends stopped playing and we moved on. In 2010 my interest was revitalized when Duels of the Planeswalkers came out on the PC - no need to find real life players anymore to play Magic. I enjoyed the heck out of that game and got its two sequels& thinking I wouldnt get into paper Magic again - I was wrong& it seems.Back in the day there were no Deckbuilder's Toolkits& so a new player would start his collection either by buying the intro packs& a deck of his choice& or simply starting to collect booster packs (the latter is a bad idea since you need to |decide| for one color to build your first deck and have enough lands to build it in the first place - which you wont get by just purchasing boosters). I had bought two premade 40 card theme decks and then started collecting boosters. Thus& I am glad new players today have a fantastic way to start the game (and there is no better way): by buying the Deckbuilder's toolkit.The thing I like about Magic& apart from playing the game and admiring the beautiful artwork of each card is spending time on deckbuilding - and that is made impossible if you buy the intro pack or a premade deck.Read more â€º"
3922,1174,4," A friend bought me this for Christmas as we had both been interested in Magic having played the computer game of it rather extensively. The box is good and the value for money is great! However& I would have preferred for it to be a bit more centralised around certain colours or themes& as I now have ~100 cards I'll never use in my blue deck& with no one to trade with easily. The addition of the four Boosters is very nice though as it's almost cheaper to buy this box than it is to buy 4 boosters by themselves :D"
3923,1174,5," Great for a beginners& get a nice box to store your cards in to. Wouldn't recommend to some one who has a a decent collection already. Best you will get is 4 rare cards and a few uncommons. The price on amazon is steeper though best off buying it directly from the supplier (magicmadhouse)as its cheaper than going through amazon and they do free P"
3924,1175,5," items arrived and received exactely what pictures shows. really pleased with them."
3925,1176,2," I own pretty much every yu-gi-oh deck released& and i have to say this is comfortably the worst.Very defense minded&these cards are never going to cause any real damage to your opponent& except deflected dmage when they attack your face downs. Even in defense the lower level cars hold nothing more special than 2000& which is on par with the likes of Mystic Elf and Island Turtle.Yes Exodd master of the guard does have 4000 defense& but this is never going to win a duel for you. The only card that saves this deck from being a complete washout is the mighty Megarock dragon& powered up by 700 for every earth monster taken out of play but its own effect!And it is classed as a special summon! Too weak for my liking with basic cards such as shield and sword duplicated& would best be used when combined with an attacking biased deck such as Dinosaur's rage or my personal favorite Machine Revolt (Ignores trap cards and some spell)."
3926,1176,5," Box was Tattered but the cards inside were in supreme condition& I love this deck as it is going to help screw over my friends when we play!"
3927,1176,4," Great deck& but this is mainly based on invunrebility& not attack"
3928,1176,4," Daughter was delighted. But the price sticker still on the packet& showing the US price of $4.99& left me feeling ripped off."
3929,1177,5," Delivery was quick and easy items came in a very high quality super happy in definitely going to be using this more often"
3930,1177,5," Bought this for my son in law for Christmas. He loved it as he collects them. Came in a box."
3931,1177,5," It's epic got 2 gods and their artefacts"
3932,1178,4," Well made& looks good.  Does what it says on the tin."
3933,1179,5," Good cards from this pack& boosted my deck nicely."
3934,1180,4," It wasn't a lucky booster&but I found something interesting in it.I hope to buy other discounted boosters in the future."
3935,1181,5," this were awesome fundraising with a kick sold quick for clic sargent as everyone was interested in music rather than just a football card"
3936,1181,5," chosen to raise funds for charity and found them to be popular with the group as a change from football cards"
3937,1182,5," Delivered quickly. Goods perfect."
3938,1183,5," I liked the cards that came with the tin and i also got a few useful cards from the booster packs&I will probably buy one again once i need another place to put my cards"
3939,1183,5," Nice size tin that can hold the cardsSome nice cards with it can say much about the iteam  i got the tital&dragon ruler of waterfalls"
3940,1183,5," Ordered on 24th Decemeber& est del 31st. Order arrived 2 days early even in the christmas period. The item is as it is described& and in perfect condition& as well as being sealed."
3941,1183,5," Ordered this for my son for his birthday& he was delighted with them& item delivered very quickly and well packaged would highly recommend and use again."
3942,1183,5," Never seems to amaze how many cards are out there!! Son is over joyed with cards& no repeats& great value. Delivery super quick. Highly recommended"
3943,1183,5," The collectors tins and cards within were as described and arrived very quickly all the way from Japan. I would recommend this product and the company who sold it."
3944,1184,5," came in a hurry the set only came out yesterday so happy i get it today best tin ever so i well add some of the cards to my deck so let's duel. :)"
3945,1184,5," This was a christmas gift"
3946,1184,4," I bought this for my 8 year old son& it is his first set of cards& he really likes them and he will continue collecting them. Thanks!"
3947,1184,4," My son has had a lot of fun out of this pack. It contains a good selection of cards and easy to follow instruction of the game. The only downside of the game itself is understanding what some of the cards functions are."
3948,1184,5," My son was delighted with this tin&  really happy to have a special place for his cards. He also got a pack of Yu gi oh cards and keeps them all in there together. It beats a cardboard box hands down for durability."
3949,1184,5," This is a good tin. There's loads of cards which both collectors and new players alike will enjoy. Awesome tin"
3950,1184,5," Lots of good quality cards for a few different archetypes& a very good bundle for an experimental player looking to run a few different decks"
3951,1184,5," Bought this on behalf of my son& who is extremely happy with the contents being a massive Yu gi oh fan."
3952,1185,3," |I like the booster packs& this particular one wasn't amazing& but they have zero control over what is in them|! was the verdict of the son who bought them"
3953,1185,4," I found out after purchasing this as a Christmas gift& that there is a known formula in large booster packs you can use to tell which packs hold good cards. Therefore sellers often use Amazon to sell of the ones they know won't have the most valuable cards to get rid of the less valuable packs at a cheaper price. So& although I ordered several packs to ensure he would get good ones& the result was they were all 'ok' but no really good ones in! If I'd have know I would have gone to a shop."
3954,1185,5," Very pleased with my purchase"
3955,1186,5," Simple but effective& this is a nice& cheaper alternative to the regular tins that still manage to throw a couple of booster packs your way. The art style is rather nice and the effect on the tin itself is what you'd call 'pretty cool'. Can't complain for the price! Even has a small compartment for keeping damage counters& die etc in the top. Nifty!"
3956,1186,5," 22 .3.15"
3957,1187,5," Perfect for munchkin dungeon cards."
3958,1188,5," Really happy with this fat pack not only did i get 3 maze runners i also open voices of resurgencefelt like i had won the lotto :0)"
3959,1188,5," This pack is great value indeed with more than enough to assemble several basic decks and enough instruction sheets to get you playing in no time."
3960,1188,4," Very nice& nothing more to it."
3961,1189,5," Perfect for protecting your most valuable trading cards"
3962,1190,4," I chose this folder to store my magic cards in. For that purpose it has been fine however I was disappointed that the design shown was not the one which I received. The design had factored in my choosing of this product and I would have preferred it to the one I got. But I chose not to return it as functionally the items were identical."
3963,1190,4," The overall product is quite durable.  If you want bullet proof this isn't for you& however the cover is tough and it'll keep the cards safe.It really is quite a chunky binder so it can take quite a beating.  It holds 100 sheets& 18 cards per sheet& that's 1800 cards capacity (un-sleeved) and when full the binder doesn't tend to bulge.The sleeves themselves are Ultra Pro Platinum 9-Pocket Pages which are amazing& they do not cloud up& are PVC free& glossy and scratch resistant and they are (most importantly) detachable from the binder."
3964,1191,5," Very pleased"
3965,1192,5," I HAVE ALREADY REVIEWED A NUMBER OF OTHER ITEMS"
3966,1192,5," I was considering to buy but it's not much money so I risked and it arrived on time in very good condition. My son is very pleased. After all I can recommend to all match attax fans."
3967,1193,5," What's not to like? The rush of opening 36 boosters& at below-market price... Got a couple mythics& plus Ajani and Bolas& and lots of other cool cards. If you can't afford it& get a few friends together& and have fun :)"
3968,1194,5," rather like it not bad"
3969,1194,5," All good."
3970,1194,5," Good"
3971,1194,5," My bf will be happy with me"
3972,1194,1," Brilliant"
3973,1195,5," It came so fast& I do recommend this I got great pulls! Got 2 EX Full art's. I got the Gengar EX Full art& and the Magnezone EX full art. Plush you get the Galade EX with the box. 3 great cards for a cheap price!I hear some people got bad pulls& I guess I was just lucky& but please give it a chance you can get something good like I did.  Good luck!"
3974,1195,5," They are expensive but the kids love them."
3975,1195,3," Product as on package"
3976,1195,5," Perfect. No damage& some great cards inside!"
3977,1195,4," Good but no good pulls"
3978,1196,4," I decided to buy this pack after a friend of mine kept begging me to learn how to play. The cards in the pack are good cards& and everything arrived sealed and in excellent condition."
3979,1196,5," This yu-gi-oh deck is my first one. It is great and it came in perfect condition quickly.

AWESOME DECK!"
3980,1196,4," My items came within 2 days which was quicker then i expected. box was damged a little but the cards were in perfect condicion.That is probibly the reason the product was 7.60 then the shop value of 10 pounds. good starter deck to get at this price."
3981,1196,5," There are a lot of cards that are really necessary& but kind of difficult to get. For the more experienced player& this Starter Deck contains a LOT of brilliant cards.For the experienced players:Number 39 Utopia is (probably) the most-used Xyz card in current meta decks. It's very easy to summon& and the effects are absolutely brilliant.Alexandrite Dragon is a nice beatdown card& and can work well in a variety of decks& particularly if you're running Rescue Rabbit. With 2000 ATK for a level 4 it's pretty sweet.Cyber Dragon is pretty self-explanatory. Everyone wants Cyber Dragon. EVERYONE.Swords of Revealing Light is a sought-after card& especially for burn/lockdown decks.I've also seen Maestroke& The Symphony Djinn used a fair bit.For the beginners:This deck is a BRILLIANT starting point for Yu-Gi-Oh!. Although the combos aren't particularly advanced& they ARE effective - don't be under any illusions& this will crash and burn against a meta (powerful) deck& but it's great fun to use. You'll want to either buy or build a stronger deck with more powerful and thought-out combos once you start entering tournaments& though.5/5& great product."
3982,1196,5," this is a grea starter deck for people who collect yugioh or people who are just starting out.it comes with a great set of cards& a floor mat and a rule book.a very good deck set."
3983,1196,5," If you want a great Level 4 and below deck this is the one you want to go to.This has some pretty amazing spells and traps for a starter deck and whats even better is that you can actually mix this deck with others"
3984,1196,5," Wow thx so much I checked all theses cards signally would cost 50 pounds but I got it for a good 10 pounds thx"
3985,1196,5," Yes my son was so happy with them and we did have wait that long to get them so yes I am very happy"
3986,1197,5," my grandsons were thrilled with these books and cards having great time putting them in book recommend this trader to all"
3987,1198,4," I bought this product before the official release date of the packs it contains and found that the price then was vastly higher than its current price which i thought was bad& however this is a good idea if you want to improve your collection and try out some of the latest cards."
3988,1198,5," came on time and was wrapped well.no damage to the box and i got some awesome pulls!!!!!! this is a must but product. i got my money back too ^^ and pulled a ultimate tiger king ultimate"
3989,1199,5," Hilarious drafting fun& as well as some great cards."
3990,1200,4," This was a good buy& although I didn't get any good drops& the tin is great. And the Delphox Ex card is really nice quality. They also threw in a small pack of Haribo which I thought was a nice way to top it off. :)"
3991,1200,5," This is my second tin out of the three Kalos tins so far and it was fun opening it! I didn't get anything to spectacular all I got was a rare reverse and a holo (Rare reverse:Floatzel) (Holo:Milotic). But I was a bit sad that there was no plasma freeze pack but it doesn't matter! All I need now is the chesnaught tin! This tin is also great for storage. If you want to know what packs there is then read on: 1 plasma blast& 1 XY & and 2 flash fire packs. Thanks for reading and hope you found this helpful!! Also I did sleeve the cards afterwards!!"
3992,1200,5," Brilliant stuff& delivered second day after dispatch& and came in perfect condition& well packaged!Pulled a really nice Magnezone ex full art& so happy with the cards as well!"
3993,1200,5," Great variety and got a mega charazard ex plus the tin is great for storage"

4008,1208,4," It arrived a few days later of what was predicted but is a legit pokemon tgc pack and I am satisfied with it.I'm saying that is a legit pack because I bought it for a good price here and I was worried that might be fake cards& it's not."
4009,1208,4," Received lot common cards couple duplicates but I cant fault the quality of them& this is great for collectors all ages and fun."
4010,1208,5," OTHER COLLECTORS OF POKEMON WELL DONE MY SON IS TEN YEARS OF AGE AND AS REQUESTED THESE FOR SOME TIME"
4011,1208,5," Perfect to add to my card collection! It was really good and a great price too. I found it very intriguing to see all of the newer Pokemon."
4012,1208,5," I ordered a pack of these cards& and even though what I received was in perfect condition& it was not the Emerging Powers cards. I got sent Boundaries Crossed cards. Other than that though& great quality."

4015,1211,5," I ordered this item expecting it to arrive in a few days it arrived the very next day and was pleased with what cards I received if you're looking to collect the entire set this is perfect I got 57 out of 60 cards so you don't have to worry about buying multiple boxes and the cards are awesome."
4016,1211,5," I am in LOVE with this box. And the price I got it for was a pure bargain. I would definitely buy another if I could get it to around the same price. There're definitely cards for everyone in this box and it's a sheer thrill to open. Absolutely amazing and probably one of my favorite yugioh boxes."
4017,1211,5," Really amazing& this is a 60 card set and I pulled 54 of the set with this box and got some doubles that are awesome like kateokage& kurivolt and some really good traps like heraldry record and number wall...if you're a fan of the TCG or just a fan its a good box to buy."
4018,1212,5," The tin looks good and is a good size for keeping the cards stored in while taking part in competitions"
4019,1212,4," Got this for my 12 year old son& he loves it & very happy with it& would get his friends one of these"
4020,1213,5," it was all fine"
4021,1214,4," Bought for my grandson's birthday. He is very please with the cards in a tin& it keeps them in good condition. Also he can play online with them."
4022,1214,5," my grandson is very happy with this product &"
4023,1214,5," very good"
4024,1214,5," Outrageously overpriced (everywhere) but the kids love it so..."
4025,1214,5," 25  .  3  .15"
4026,1215,5," well pleased with postage and fun to fund rise with"
4027,1215,5," A bit of fun you can have whilst raising money for charity"
4028,1215,5," Just what we needed for our fundraising"
4029,1215,5," Excellent"
4030,1215,5," good"
4031,1216,5," A*"
4032,1217,5," Very good quality"
4033,1217,5," Perfect reward"
4034,1217,5," Thanks good"
4035,1217,5," Excellent!"
4036,1218,5," Great product if you know someone who loves pokemon"
4037,1218,5," Amazing tin and boosters. Thanks!"
4038,1218,5," love it x"
4039,1219,5," Brilliant& arrived quickly and was exactly what I was expecting&"
4040,1219,4," My grandson was pleased with it"
4041,1220,5," Brilliant box of cards& no issues whatsoever. Would recommend to anyone looking to improve their deck - and the awesome dice is a bonus."
4042,1220,5," Arrived undamaged and much quicker than I thought it would! Other than that its just a fatpack not much else to say about it."
4043,1221,5," Great quality and fits MTG cards perfectly. I highly recommend this product if you want to keep your cards from the wear and tear of use.Shipping was quick and the product arrived in perfect condition."
4044,1221,5," Good sleeves came promptly allow you to have that traditional mtg look that i always prefered over modern sleves"
4045,1221,5," A classic card sleeve that looks good on any magic deck& durable as well. This sleeve needs to be reprinted."
4046,1222,4," The product is for 3.06 pounds and the delivery was for 0.03 pounds a total of 3.09 pounds. its worth it stores sell this product for a lot more and you will get your money worth. perfect conditions as well as reasonable delivery date. the card the the pack were allright & it hasn't been open at all since I had gotten it."
4047,1222,5," Reasonable price and in perfect condition. Very easy to make your money back as all the cards are quite good& especially the laval cards. Sold the three I didn't want and made a Â£3 profit"
4048,1223,5," I have to be honest& I didn't know what to expect when this arrived& however after opening the box and the packs it turns out that this is a nice little subset of the PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game.There are 27 cards in total& with 10 non-EX full art cards& (Reshiram& Palkia& Zekrom& Dialga& Latias& Latios& Black Kyurem& White Kyurem& Regigigas and Arceus)& 2 EX cards (Hoopa and Pikachu) and 15 regular cards with holographic stars on them (much like the Radiant Collection subset in the Legendary Treasures expansion)."
4049,1223,4," Kids loved the holo deck. Complete set in each pack.Well worth it for collecting."
4050,1224,5," I purchased this for my 8 year old nephew& who is in to Yu-Gi-Oh! big time - he thought it was fantastic. This makes a lovely addition to his collection. Delivery was fast as well. Brilliant!"
4051,1224,5," very good quality and arrived on time"
4052,1225,3," Great case for great price. My only gripe here is that the image of this product is very miss-leading.Ultra Pro changed their case a couple of months ago and the old version (a better version if you ask fans around the world) is hard to come by.The old version has a soft |foam| inside where everything fits snugly.... as shown on the image for this product.The new Version has a stiff cardboard inside where the card boxes rattle around a little and you also wonder how long this cardboard will hold& before starting to fall apart.As you might expect& it was the new version that was delivered& even though the image shows the old one./wolf"
4053,1225,3," the product does what it says but it is very cheaply compared to what you'd expect. id shop around before jumping into this buy& but it is still okay for the price and it does the job"
4054,1225,4," Good product but could do with some improvements if possible. It can hold up to 12 deck boxes which is great for storage especially on the go if you travel with plenty of decks to tournaments or game nights etc however the user would be better served if you could adjust the size of the compartments by removing one of the cardboard dividers so you can fit in larger boxes such as the deck builder boxes which most people tend to keep instead of buying multiple deck boxes. Also i would really like it if the box were a little larger so it could have a compartment specifically for your play mat tube so everything can be kept together and perhaps having at least one compartment with a detachable lid so you can have the option of using it to store deck boxes& or attach the lid to store you dice and counters etc Another little idea would be to build two life counters into the inside of the lid so the bag can become part of the game with a pretty handy feature :)So just some suggestions i would like to see implemented in any future updates but overall a good product but for reference the box you will receive is the one in the second and third picture& good to be able to keep my decks in one bag together that i can just pick up and go so i would recommend this to anyone who travels with their cards or to those who just want something to keep all their decks together and safe"
4055,1225,5," Perfect to keep my cards well organized.All space is well organized and this will keep my cards with original state.Delivered on estimate date. very good service."
4056,1225,5," <3 Its perfect for my MTG collection. Tokens in the lid& matt in the lid& a BUNCH of decks in the compartments& then dice& counters n such in its own little pocket."
4057,1225,4," A great card game case that can hold 12 ultra-pro deck boxes the only gripe that i have is that after a while the cardboard might start to fall apart."
4058,1225,5," Awesome perfect for my mtg decks easy to carry :) awesome material as it's durable perfect for any aspiring card gamer"
4059,1225,5," Suits its requirments.  Is stylish and roomy.  I would have no problem in re ordering as needs dictate.  Great Value"
4060,1226,5," The children love these and are a great asset to our fundraising"
4061,1227,5," Bought this for my nephew"
4062,1228,5," Boosters are a great way to improve the starter decks& you should buy many boosters for a different variety of cards. You get 9 cards in a booster& which means you get 1 foil and 8 normal cards. If you are to buy some of the great booster packets you should first get a starter& I have given it a five for fun& because they are a great way to spend you free time& I also gave them a 3 for durability because they do bend easily if not looked after and the foil cards fade if not kept safe and I have given the educational value a 5 because it is a great way to improve your mathematical skills by calculating the damage to your life points."
4063,1228,5," I think yugioh cards are a great source of fun so I gave it a five stars when it came down to fun.although when it came to durability you would probably have to put them in plastic cases so I gave it a two stars.and educational purposes it does involve a fair amount of addition and subtraction"
4064,1229,5," arrive so soonï¼Œthank you very much."
4065,1230,4," I purchased this product after me and sister came down with a serious case of Poke-mania! It was mostly just the anime and video games& but then it moved on to the trading cards too. I wanted to buy two good decks& for my sister and I to start with (being complete novices to the game.) I also wanted something cheap. I came across these cards& which seemed perfect. Amazon's one day delivery was faultless. I ordered it about midday on the 7th& and received at around 8:30 the next morning! I was also impressed by the size. I was expecting two smallish boxes. I got  a much larger box than I expected! Overall& packaging was good. However& there were some minor scratches/dents/marks on the product. This was little disappointing. However& they were only minor and the content inside was pristine.  For the Â£16.95 I paid& we received:2 Battle arena decks: Being a complete novice at this game I can't really review on the quality of decks. It does seem& though that they have a nice selection of cards. There are quite a few foil ones too which are very fun to play with! Overall& I can'y fault the decks.2 Deck boxes: The deck boxes are nothing fancy: just your usual boxes with the Xerneas and Yevetal design on them. They still look quite nice though& and serve their purpose well.2 Metallic coins: I quite like these coins. They are plastic& with a glitter design of Xerneas/Yevetal on one side (heads) and a black pokemon logo on the other (tails) They make a nice addition to the game& even if I can only seem to get tails!1. Player mat (for two players) and rulesheet:. I have to say& the player mat was not what expected. I thought it would be a thin plastic mat& However& what I received was literally a piece of paper.Read more â€º"
4066,1230,5," Very decent pre-built decks. Reccommended."
4067,1230,5," Both decks are pretty solid& good for learning the game but contents come with some great cards for drafting and mixing with other set decks.Highly recommended& especially for the price."
4068,1231,2," Unfortunately 1 packet which should have contained 9 packets of 4 bars only contained 8 so I was 4 bars short I didn"
4069,1231,5," had a little trip down memory lane as i ate this when i was a young kid. They have that magical 'easter egg' taste that for some reason no other chocolate bars have& its quite a sweet chocolatey taste."
4070,1231,5," Smaller than I remember (the joys of growing up!) but still a perfect party bag filler for my son's jungle themed 1st birthday party!"
4071,1231,4," Animal Bars - not much else to say. Chocolate. Good service/price."
4072,1232,4," This tin is very fun. it comes with 4 blue bungees but they don't glow in the dark much unless you are willing to put them under the light for an hour and they dont come with the metal disks to stick onto like the bungees blind bags. But they are durable to play with and entertaining."
4073,1232,5," My Daughter is so pleased with her special glow in the dark bungees& she enjoys the little game included too."
4074,1232,5," My son has loads of Bungees and this Tin you can now put them all in the box and keep safe."
4075,1233,4," It came today and I got 1 holo from it and the promo cards are great. I can see them being used for a bunch of decks in the game."
4076,1233,4," a well received gift"
4077,1234,5," As a Pokemon fan from the word go I'm aware there are multiples in decks& usually so that you have more chance of showing off and being able to use the best card from the deck in Pokemon card battles& also multiples mean more swaps are possible! I've bought this for my brother for Christmas and know he will be very pleased. I'm pleased he loves Pokemon just as much as I do."
4078,1234,5," Great deck& great price. Not much to say really. A good selection of cards suitable for players of any level of skill and a few great cards that can be integrated into a custom deck too."
4079,1234,5," I bought these for my son and he loves them. They came with a gameplay mat and instructions. A great item. Highly recommended."
4080,1234,5," Again& not my thing& but my daughter loves it and continues to ask for more Pokemon paraphanalia. Arrived quite quickly too"
4081,1235,5," Excellent transaction& would use again."
4082,1235,5," good"
4083,1236,5," The |stones came the day after I had ordered which was good. I don`t know what other people use them for but I have devised a method using various coloured stones as jewels to introduce economic elements into a tabletop wargame which I have devised in which up to 6 players and a |Vizier| (umpire) fight over control of the |silk road from the Mediaeval Cathay to Arabia. It can be played solo if required. I first looked at |play money| but plastic coins with |Princess Suzi| on them looked a bit |naff| the |jewels| Emeralds& jade& diamonds& rubies etc each have a value and can be spent on armies& castle building etc etc. It works rather well and my |play testers say that the jewel tokens fit in with the |Arabian Nights| type setting. Well done Amazon and Arcane Tinman!"
4084,1237,5," Brought these for my Nephew who is collecting them it better to buy all the teams then keep buy packets will buy more teams from this seller and they are at a very good price and good on delivery. One very happy little boy."
4085,1237,5," Excellent value for money my son loves them& arrived quickly and well packed"
4086,1237,4," Excellent buy!! Strongly recommended!!"
4087,1237,3," had a duplicate but a good buy"
4088,1238,5," Fast shipping thanks my son was happy with this for Christmas . Well packaged ."
4089,1239,5," Very efficient service and delighted son with the cards"
4090,1239,5," Great present for someone who loves pokemon"
4091,1239,1," Recieved an empty tin no booster packs !!!"
4092,1240,5," Another set I brought my Nephew it nice to buy the full team which I will but more  of these fom this seller I'm trying to get the book full this time for him.Good price and very good on delivery ."
4093,1240,4," Excellent buy!! Strongly recommended!!"
4094,1240,5," top class"
4095,1241,5," Very good product if your looking for cheap inexpensive cards that you'll have hours of fun playing"
4096,1241,5," Awesome conditions! Very well protected!"
4097,1241,5," My grandson loved them"
4098,1242,5," Very happy.  Prompt delivery all the way from U.s.a.  Happy birthday son! Loves oshawatt and polemon"
4099,1242,5," Trading cards are as popular as the Pokemon themselves............"
4100,1243,5," Fantastic product &price and service! I will be back for more in the future! A very conscientious and reliable seller& very much recommended!"
4101,1244,5," Really nice box& and you can also use it for card storage & It comes with dividers to put in the box and split your cards.The card protectors are really nice too and ive used them all already.Got some nice pulls too but i guess thats just luck."
4102,1244,5," Bought this as a gift for my son for his birthday.  He loved it and it was the first gift he wanted to play with.I think it's a little expensive for what it is but given the popularity of Pokemon I can understand.  The box was also a lot smaller than I expected& but it contained everything that it should contain.I had an issue with delivery - I originally placed the order for this and other items for next day delivery but the confirmation advised that it would take two days& despite the website still confirming at that time that if I ordered it again it would be delivered the following day.  This was an Amazon issue though and not necessarily concerned with this item."
4103,1244,5," Got these for my son and he loves them"
4104,1244,5," Grandson was over the moon!Seems pricey for a box of cards but kids seem to love them!"
4105,1244,5," Quick and easy& arrived with no damage."
4106,1244,5," Came early and was perfect"
4107,1245,4," Six legendary PokÃ©mon cards (one being an EX) and five booster packs.  If your child is asking for PokÃ©mon cards frequently& you know how expensive they can get.  I would say this pack is decent value for money."
4108,1245,5," there was no damage on the outside of the box and the cards where very nice& boosters were pretty good as I managed to pull a mega rayquaza ex love the product and do recommend"
4109,1245,2," Gave me the booster packs but had the wrong promo cards"
4110,1245,5," Awesome a must need for every Pokemon lover"
4111,1246,5," Great item& providing a good selection of cards and 2 booster packs (retail value of these alone is Â£7) for a good price. My only complaint is that you have no idea what colour set you are going to get. I received the white/blue deck the same as the other reviewer& but would be reluctant to order again in case I got the same one. Is it possible for amazon to let you specify which one you would like?"
4112,1246,5," I got the same pack as the guys ahead of me: a blue pack. In all honesty I would have preferred a white& black or green deck having played the game on my iPad... or at least had an option to make a preference. Clearly they have a lot of blue in stock so you're seemingly likely to get blue if you order this product.However& it arrived swiftly from Amazon and I was actually very pleased with it. It's not the cheapest way to get a collection of cards together (the Deck Builders Toolkit is better in this regard) but it did mean I was able to play straight away and then use the Deck Builders Toolkit (which I bought as well) to boost what I had.Good product... and cheapest I found online (inc. postage)."
4113,1246,5," This product is great and does enable you to play a match almost immediately& however there wasn't an indication of which pack you would receive.i received the White/Blue focused pack 'Path To Victory' which is great but you may receive one of the other 4 packs.the only criticism i would say this listing has& is the lack of a picture for the product"
4114,1246,5," My brother in law collects these. I have zero knowledge on the topic& but he says it was a good buy. He's had loads of fun with them. I'll take his word for that."
4115,1247,5," Bought as a Christmas gift for my pokemon loving nephew& to me they are extremely expensive for cards but they are collectables so I suppose they are worth it."
4116,1247,5," My son was very happy with his cards. Even managed to bag a couple of rare ones. Great service as well."
4117,1247,5," Got some AMAZING cards in this box = very happy people.Best price& fantastic value."
4118,1247,5," Arrived ahead of schedule and i pulled some amazng cards from the packs"
4119,1247,5," Had some great pulls& would buy again for this price too at only Â£76"
4120,1248,5," bought these for my nephew who carnt seem to get enough of them plays for hours on end with these cards. would most definitly recommend these to any little boy."
4121,1249,3," Received in good time& and the toploaders were good& but they are not ultra pro brand& but instead they are card concept. However the toploaders I received were still good& although a bit dusty. Would have given more stars if I had received the ultra pro ones"
4122,1249,5," I have collected trading/collectable cards since I was about 12 years old and I have always tried my best to look after them. It was several years before the Pokemon series came out and protection for the cards was not easy to find. I had shoebox upon shoebox of cards and always worried about them being damaged. Then when I was about 14 I was talking to a fellow Middle Earth player and he told me about A4 9-card sleeves and toploaders& and gave me a couple of them to put my most precious cards in and the address of a dealer and I never looked back.Many cards gain in value over the years& but only if they are in pristine condition so if you are going to collect cards or want to keep |shineys| or rare ones in outstanding condition then I would recommend these pages to you.I usually purchase the |Ultra-Pro| or |MAX| protection for my trading/playing cards in order to allow them to last longer.These are more of the filmsy protectors but they do mean that your cards will not suffer from greasy competitor syndrome - where someone you are playing with is eating greasy food like crisps and is leaving their greasy fingerprints on everyone else's precious cards.You should always buy a quality cover for your cards as cheaper brands tend to contain levels of chemicals which would be harmful to your cards& like bleach& acids and alkalis."
4123,1249,5," item was as pictured and described and arrived quickly."
4124,1249,4," I don't think I received ultra pro brand& as they where all loose in a small box package. They are ok though an do the job& just make sure you have a good quality sleeve as these can be a little flimsy."
4125,1249,5," I'm surprised at how great these cases are! They helped me out a bunch when I was selling my Yu-Gi-Oh cards and I couldn't be more happier! I would recommend this to everyone!"
4126,1249,5," Very good for extra protection for a trading card if you put the trading card in a Ultra Pro Clear Deck Protector sleeve and then put that sleeve inside one of these cases."
4127,1249,4," As always very nice quality from Ultra Pro - been using these for years"
4128,1249,2," They did the job of protecting my cards but.... but they came out of the sealed package scratched"
4129,1250,5," I purchased for my younger step brother who loves pokemon cards. I grew up loving pokemon and he now is 10 and is mad on them. He asked for pokemon cards for christmas so this is the pack I got him. I dont know the names of any of the new characters (when I was a kid it was all Pikachu& Charizard& Mewtwo etc) These cards are very unrecognizable to me& but he was very excited about the cards in the pack. It came well presented with the holo card on top. I'd recommend if you are looking for a larger pack of pokemon cards."
4130,1250,5," Great product"
4131,1250,3," I ordered this thinking I was going to get the deck shown in the image (since it is the ONLY deck shown in this product page). However when the delivery arrived I got the other Plasma Blast Theme Deck& which is still good& but not what I expected. Despites this& the delivery was very fast (arrived 1 day early) and there were no problems."
4132,1250,3," its good just comes with loads of doubles."
4133,1251,5," My grandson loved this for his collection"
4134,1251,5," Love the tin love the cards love the mini binder LOVE EVERYTHING"
4135,1252,5," Super duper epic dudes!!!! I got foil Sarkhan& sidisi& sorin& all fetchlands!!!!!!!!! :  )"
4136,1253,5," I bought this as a way for both myself and my 7 y.o. daughter to learn and enjoy a Trading Card Game together. We're pretty keen board gamers but hadn't tried a TCG before& and Yu-Gi-Oh looked like a good compromise for us in terms of theme (Pokemon is not for me& and Magic the Gathering is not for the small ones).For the price it's a great introduction to the game& and because this set can function as two balanced decks to duel against one another& or as one full deck of individual cards& we've been able to learn and try the game out at a low cost. I'm now thinking of getting a second set so we both have a full deck before going down the rabbit hole of buying booster packs every now and then to customise our decks.Everything you need to get started is in the box& including two paper play-mats and basic rulebook. The rulebook is fine to get you started with the basic mechanics without being overly complex& but you'll soon want to grab the full rulebook pdf from the Konami Yu-Gi-Oh website. After a couple of games I had a bunch of questions that began |so if I do this& does that mean that....|& and referring to the full ruleset answered all of these.The kids have even started watching Yu-Gi-Oh on TV as it gives a pretty good intro to the game itself& and they love sifting through the cards to see if they have anything they recognise."
4137,1253,5," its brilliant! especially if youre just begining to play and have someone else to play with ie for brothers or if friends want to learn. came in great condition and arrived three days early! the cards are good and some of the re-prints were nice. definately worth what it costs!"
4138,1253,4," A shame EU cannot get the individual start packs like Japan and America can& however is fantastic if you want to get to grips with the basic of YuGiOh. The combined deck is a bit poor though."
4139,1253,5," Arrived promptly. According to my 9 year old had good selection of cards. He was very pleased so that's good enough for me"
4140,1253,5," Purchased for son who was very pleased not only with product but quick delivery."
4141,1253,5," Great product"
4142,1254,5," If you are a Pokemon fan ... am sure you will love this."
4143,1255,5," Not sure what more I can say& a counter is a counter& its a small glass bead. :) well here goes :PThese counters are great!! they are all uniform in colour and size!! They will satisfy all your counter needs!!"
4144,1256,5," Fantastic played them against my sister and we've really enjoyed them"
4145,1256,5," Mum son was impressed."
4146,1256,3," This product is of very little& if any& use to serious MTG players. However& if you are a casual player and collector like me& then I believe you are going to enjoy this product.In terms of playability& a lot of people in the comments section here claim that the blue deck is overall more powerful than the red deck& but this is untrue in my opinion. From my experience& after playing a series of games with both decks& me and my friend have concluded that the red deck just appears to be dominant due to its strong early performance. Whatever people think& there is clearly an imbalance in this duel set. Be it as it may& the product will deliver some enjoyment to you and a friend.In terms of pricing this product disappoints me a little. The priciest card on this set at the time of this review is Krenko& Mob Boss& according to trolltradercards&com at the price of ~Â£3.12. The rest of the cards have very little value. This tells me that you would be able to replicate these decks by buying the individual cards for an overall incredibly reduced price. I suspect that it would be a lot more worth it buying the box and leaving it sealed for collection. It could potentially become a lot more expensive as did the Goblins Vs Elves Duel Decks. Other than that I see no other reason to buy this set& unless you are feeling lazy and don't feel like going through all the trouble of buying the individual cards."
4147,1256,5," fun decks some interesting cards needs a spot of tinkering after you've played them a few times - worth checking online for card list"
4148,1256,5," asdescribedperfect"
4149,1257,5," Bought as a stocking filler. There will be one v happy boy in our house on Xmas day! All expected cards present and in perfect condition."
4150,1257,4," Amazing product! Bought for a frustrated six year old's birthday after spending goodness knows how much on the blind packs. Now he has all of his favourite team-easy! Only negative being the packaging-the cards arrived in just a white envelope. Despite being rammed into our postbox (along with various other pieces of post) the cards managed to remain undamaged but could very easily have been different."
4151,1257,5," Very pleased with stickers& which were for my 10 year old son& delivery was made before Xmas& well before delivery date stated"
4152,1257,4," Good price for a full set of team cards. Little boy will be delighted on Christmas morning. However the description states it would be well packaged - I don't count them all loose in an envelope as well packaged! The cards were all in good condition but they could at least have been bound together with a band!"
4153,1257,4," Very happy with card& bit disappointed with the ppackaging."
4154,1258,4," These counters are great for general use in many trading card games - I personally use my own for Magic the Gathering& the bloodstone red variant is very shiny and are nice to look at and play with.Generally with products of this type (like gardening pebbles& or fish tank gravel& or general purpose decorative stones) there is room for error& for example chipped or halved counters which I recieved two of& my pack contained 30 pieces which is good& as it's only in rare circumstances that I'll ever use more than 25-28.I'd reccomend this product to any trading card game player that is in bad need of some nice counters."
4155,1259,5," Fantastic domino cards which arrived on time as advertised. These domino cards are helping our club raise much needed funds."
4156,1259,5," I have given this product a 5 star& this is because they were delivered promptly& excellent quality and definitely worth the money that was paid.I would definitely recommend this product."
4157,1259,5," Well worth buying. Much cheaper than any others and you get both sides to play on."
4158,1259,5," well pleased with postage time& ideal for a bit of fund raising"
4159,1260,4," Before the banlist of this year Dragunity was a good deck but seeming as you cant use dragon ravine now it sucks for friendly games get this deck for competitive play don't."
4160,1260,5," Great item& all as described"
4161,1260,3," The product arrived on time in fine order and all the rest of it& which was promising. The actual cards in the deck do not work together particularly well because it needs more speed& but otherwise it's reasonable enough to take apart and add to. Overall a good product& but definitely needs one's own personal twist to improve it. The 20 cards with it were okay& but hardly fitted the deck at all - only one dragon/dragunity related card in the whole pack!"
4162,1260,5," good"
4163,1261,3," Have not used these yet as season os summer so will start in the near future& hopefully will make a few quid for club."
4164,1261,5," Good value"
4165,1261,4," easy to use& good design& good price& will definitely buy more in the future. item arrived on due date as advised"
4166,1262,4," What can you say it's a balloon."
4167,1263,5," Does what it says on the box& very good quality baloons"
4168,1264,5," great for the big day"
4169,1264,5," A"

4171,1266,5," helped make our event special ."
4172,1267,5," I bought these for my Dad's 90th Birthday. These colourful balloons are large and strong and easy to inflate! I recommend them :)"
4173,1268,4," Arrived promptly and all in good condition.  Last well for daughter's pony party.  Only missing 5 stars due to they could be a bit bigger& otherwise recommended."

4176,1270,5," Fast delivery and served its purpose effectively."
4177,1271,5," Bought these for exams and they were really good& well worth there money and they looked good on the table"
4178,1271,4," Good product. Gold tinsel instead of the normal tissue streamers."
4179,1271,5," Look exactly as described. Not used them yet!"
4180,1272,5," got this for a party in July to celebrate my husbands 65th looks fine I have used these before just adds to the fun"
4181,1272,5," Purchased these ready for a new year gig my partners band are playing. Having seen feedback that these sometimes deflate quickly we inflated them all.  Over 24 hours later they are all still inflated and looking good.  Should add to the fun on new years eve. Look good value for money."
4182,1272,5," got this for a party in July to celebrate my husbands 65th looks fine I have used these before just adds to the fun"
4183,1272,5," Really good. I ordered 10 of these for my gold themed 50th party. They all stayed up all night. Highly recommend."
4184,1272,4," Managed to stay inflated for the party unlike some others reviewed on here. In fact it still is a week later!"
4185,1272,1," Had a hole in it& which is no good 10 mins before you need it for a NYE party!"
4186,1272,5," Perfect! Bought for a joke so really pleased Thanks"
4187,1272,5," Excellent entertainment on a night out"
4188,1273,5," Very happy with this product"
4189,1274,4," Looked lovly"
4190,1275,5," Perfect for my moon and stars themed baby shower"
4191,1276,4," cute"
4192,1277,5," they are balloons how can you rate them ?!they looked good alongside the banner"
4193,1278,4," Nice looking badge good colours looks better than ones I saw in card shops. Knocked off 1star as couldn't get it to stand on shelf straight ."
4194,1279,5," Served the purpose!"
4195,1280,5," Ordered three different numbers at the same time and the posting was adjusted cheaper for me even greater value. Not used it yet but the other two were a hit as black made a change from blue. Great looking and son thought the black was cool.A word of warning does not come with a weight but knew that when I bought it."
4196,1281,5," I organise a community event each summer. Over the years& I have bought several balloon pumps that were not worthy the money that we have paid for.Luckily& this year& I bought two of these pumps and they were excellent.I highly recommend them. Superb quality& effective& and reasonably priced."
4197,1281,5," Such a simple thing yet so helpful! Bought it in preparation for my son's 4th bday party. Practised some balloon shaping on youtube the night before and managed to mesmerise 9 kiddos. Worth it."
4198,1281,5," Does what it says on the tin& quick and easy and sturdy - I wished I had bought one sooner."
4199,1281,5," Excellent Pump. I couldn't do without it. I have been pumping up  balloons for a special party& it was so easy to use& and every balloon came up trumps. Well done!"
4200,1281,5," Why haven't I ever bought one of these pumps before! Just great& blew up the balloons I bought for my grand daughter without any huffing and puffing from me. I shall have no hesitation inflating balloons now and have even purchased some modelling ones to try out!. Pump arrived before estimated delivery date and well packaged."
4201,1281,5," Bought 2 of these to blow up balloons for a birthday party. Did exactly what I wanted and took all the hassle out of blowing up balloons."
4202,1281,5," Quite possibly the most wonderful tool in my kit!Next to my cordless Dyson this is a miracle in my life!With two grand children who don't believe it is a party if there isn't AT LEAST a couple of hundred balloonsbouncing around - this little machine is fabulous!"
4203,1281,5," We decided in our house to learn to make balloon animals. I could not blow up the balloons myself so I got this pump. It is excellent."
4204,1282,5," I've bought these for my lovely fiancee's surprise 50th birthday do in May (Shhhh!)There are 25 balloons that can be inflated upto 12 inches which is quite large. I've tries a few with air (lung power!) and they are very good. Great quality and the red colour is nice and vibrant& just what I wanted! On the day I will be using Helium to inflate these so I can decorate the tables with them. So after all is done and dusted I will update this review with some info of how they performed and a few pics! Very happy with these and can recommend"
4205,1282,2," These came quickly and were easy to inflate but almost half of them had holes in. I didn't have time to reorder them as they were being blown up on the day.Needless to say my arsenal themed 40th birthday was lacking balloons!"
4206,1282,5," Red balloons& just as desribed. Perfect for my sons birthday party."
4207,1282,4," I was happy with the purchase& the colour red exactly how it is in the picture! My only concern was the packaging 25 balloons in an envelope loose not in a plastic bag then an envelope just loose and to me that isn't very hygienic but overall good. Came very quickly"
4208,1282,5," These balloons arrived in good time. I used these plain red balloons to accompany the 40th Wedding Anniversary balloons for our celebration. These balloons were a good size and good value for money"
4209,1282,2," The balloons themselves were good& but they arrived 5 days after last expected delivery date & which was too late for my event& and I had to go and buy more balloons from a shop for my event."
4210,1282,5," These are pretty large balloons that were used for my kids parties and seemed to stay around the house for weeks after. Nice deep colours& no problems with defects or punctures."
4211,1282,2," Although delivered on time.  The person blowing them up said the quality was not that good.  They kept bursting :-(& Although the ones that didn't burst looked okay."
4212,1283,5," These were a great decoration for our St George's Day party.  They are good quality and I would recommend them to anyone organising a party."
4213,1284,5," Fast delivery&good amount of products for price& only issue was a fair few of the balloons either already had small holes in or popped whilst blowing up"
4214,1285,3," The quality of these balloons were poor. Most them popped whilst I was trying to blow them up& I was most disappointed"
4215,1285,1," Arrived 3 days late and 2 balloons were faulty. Don't waste your money"
4216,1285,5," These looked great in our party venue. Good value for money."
4217,1285,4," Arrived on time and were as good as we expected"
4218,1285,5," I was happy with the balloons thank you amazon"
4219,1285,5," Helped smooth over turning 30!"
4220,1286,3," Great price& prompt delivery& but absolutely no way that each canister will do 30 balloons at the size quoted .... trust me& we tried.It was my daughters christening and luckily i ordered two tanks& one as spare& thanks to all the commentators who said the exact same thing. I think we managed just over 30 with both& and that was using the handy balloon sizer on the box that you can cut out.Also& instructions didn't really exist and due to the light weight of these items i almost gave them up as empty from the start. Once you have turned the valve slightly on& put your balloon over the rubber teet& and then you have to squeeze/bend the rubber teet slightly to get the gas flowing.They did the job& and i would buy again& although many more than they suggest i need"
4221,1286,4," Arrived promptly. We got 30 balloons out of the one canister (not fully inflating them) but less out of the other. Most of the balloons stayed afloat for the duration of the party. Very easy to use - instructions printed in large print on each box. Very portable too. Only downside is not sure how to dispose of the canisters."
4222,1286,5," Very easy to use& filled exactly as many balloons as stated& helium lasted throughout the day and into the evening (we then did the silly voices thing with them& so can't comment on how long they would have lasted!)"
4223,1286,5," Glad I bought two& did about 30 x 12| balloons and a couple of larger foil ones and had a bit spare. Worked well& delivered by courier& and got a time slot for delivery& all good& thanks."
4224,1286,4," Bought these two gas cylinder and enough to pump 20 helium balloons which they are quite big ones& easy to use& definitely recommend it."
4225,1287,5," Arrived quickly and as described"
4226,1287,5," Good Value"
4227,1288,5," Filled with own helium for a birthday party it'd huge and brought a lot of smiles to people's faces"
4228,1289,4," Love these& reusable which is great!"
4229,1289,5," great really creates an atmosphere"
4230,1289,5," great"
4231,1290,5," Brilliant ... My son loves angry birds and luved his balloonsOnce helium inserted ... 1wk later and the ballon is still inflated"
4232,1290,5," Nothing else to say. If your child loves angry birds get one! I bought this for my son's 6th b'day party and he loved it."
4233,1290,5,""
4234,1290,5," very good value. stayed inflated for almost 2 weeks."
4235,1290,5," Great product"
4236,1291,5," Nice design on the balloons. As the image is printed upwards we did fill these with helium and they stayed up for about 4 hours and then slowly came down& but all in all they looked perfect during the party."
4237,1291,5," arrived on time.  Really easy to blow up with balloon blowere and easy to tie.  Lasted a long time too&  Would but again"
4238,1291,2," Be careful when buying these& if you actually want the Snow White balloons shown in the picture. Then be careful as I ordered these from a seller expecting the Snow White  balloon design pictured. Turned out to be |Disney Princess| with Ariel& Belle"
4239,1291,5," Great snow white balloons& daughter loved them!"
4240,1292,5," Lasted ages. Great quality balloons."
4241,1293,5," Daughter loved this peppa balloon. Lasted well over 3 weeks. Would recommend and will use them again to buy more in the future"
4242,1293,2," Pretty balloon but unfortunately had a small hole in which caused it to deflate quickly and had to be thrown away."
4243,1293,5," My granddaughter loves peppa pig and this was for her birthday she was thrilled with the gallons as they were very big"
4244,1293,5," Great birthday balloon& daughter loves to play with it& still inflated three weeks on& so great value& will buy again"
4245,1294,5," Good item exactly as described"
4246,1295,5," GREAT BUNNY!!"
4247,1296,5," My son loved this balloon.  Filled very easily from my helium cannister"
4248,1296,5," All good.  Easy to inflate with air or helium."
4249,1296,5," Fab quality"
4250,1296,5," Thank you"
4251,1297,5," amazing!! I took them  to toysrus to be inflated and out of the 4 I purchased there was just one which didn't inflate too well and seemed to deflate within 12 hours or so.  the others were fine though and looked fab"
4252,1297,5," Arrived quickly and just what we expected."
4253,1298,5," Fantastic products great delivery && many thanks .. Have told all my family and friends definitely would buy again"
4254,1298,5," Fabulous"
4255,1299,5," These were fabulous& used at a party. We got them filled with helium (Â£5 each at local florist) and they lasted about 3 weeks. Loved them!"
4256,1299,5," Lovely balloon still up a week after I filled it with helium . Nice colours and good size Thank you."
4257,1299,5," This was just beautiful and a great size I wasn't disappointed. I would buy again.."
4258,1300,4," all girls like these& bigger than expected"
4259,1301,5," Up on wall at all home to cheer them up."
4260,1302,5," Great balloon."
4261,1303,5," Speedy delivery and great product as described"
4262,1304,5," Item arrived safely thanks"
4263,1304,3," okay item"
4264,1305,5," excellent for party  decoration& responsible price recomend for friends and everyone  who looks for good product with good price to pay"
4265,1305,5," Very good balloons come quick thanks"
4266,1305,5," Lovely"
4267,1306,5," Great balloon and great quality& looks like a beach ball. Still inflated 13 days on!"
4268,1307,1," Whilst these were inexpensive& I hoped they would be fit for purpose. Instead& only 6 out of 20 stayed inflated for more than four hours. As they were bought to be an integral part of my granddaughter's birthday party decorations& this was very disappointing and I will not be buying them again."
4269,1307,5," i ordered 2 packs of these balloons as they are great. it says air fill only but i did fill a few with helium for my sons party and they stayed floated for days.nice bright colours and they were perfect for the party. the kids went mad for them as they were all blown up on the floor.only one popped as i wasnt paying attention and blew to much air into it lol"
4270,1307,5," well worth money and would be buying from again when needed. I found these pretty strong and lasted far longer"
4271,1307,4," Easy to blow up& looked good"
4272,1307,5," Fast delivery. Nice and bright assortment of colours."
4273,1308,5," This was a good value for money and covered all my party requirements. Just one thing to be aware of is that the balloons give off a funny smell when first inflated but it had disappeared after 24 hours - probably the latex in them."
4274,1309,5," Bought these for my birthday party and they were very pretty"
4275,1309,4," some of the balloons had holes in so we couldnt have as many table displays as we needed but the rest of the balloons were just what we wanted"
4276,1309,5," very happy with purchase look great& havnt tested as yet as for party but cant see a problem& daughter will be happy"
4277,1310,5," THANKS A LOT MY BOY BIRTHDAY WAS AMAZING THANKS ALSO TO YOU"
4278,1311,3," I loved the quality of these balloons but when you tie up a bunch and hang them the '100' is upside down! However as my Mum is so old and partially sighted she didn't notice!"
4279,1311,5," Not a lot to say really. They inflated and looked like balloons. They did as described and haven't deflated a week later!"
4280,1311,5," Good quality just perfect for the day"
4281,1311,3," Just what I wanted & lovely colours."
4282,1312,5,""
4283,1312,5," great fun for my childrens halloween party my children loved it& it really does glow and the eyes flashing a really good halloween prob."
4284,1312,5," Brilliant"
4285,1313,1," Inflated correctly as per instructions& picture very faded when inflated& no where near as bright as shown. Not really suitable for children either as within half an hour  of my 4yr having it& it had burst. She wasn't really being rough either she was gently batting it too an fore. Decoration purposes only and not really that as the colours are very poor.."
4286,1313,5," Was an add on little gift for my 15 year old sisters birthday. She's obsessed with mermaids and so of course she loves it. Looks amazing and is still up after 4 weeks of filling it up:)"
4287,1313,5," Arrived early and stayed up for over a week"
4288,1314,5," I purchased this item for my 21st Birthday party& it looked fantastic on the night& it was a special touch& I would purchase again and recommend to friends."
4289,1314,5," great product good value for money also order a few more birthday things i was really pleased with all of them just what i wanted& will order again for next birthdays"
4290,1314,1," Wasnt to happy with this item& when i got it out of the packet & it was too difficult to separate so that we could hang it .Then it broke.Toooo flimsy"
4291,1314,5," Pleased with these birthday decorations&quite fiddly to get sorted but worth the effort for the money!!!Looked nice once suspended from ceiling!"
4292,1314,5," Very effective and easy to use decoration. Easy to put away as well. Arrived quickly. Definitely recommend it and the company."
4293,1314,5," Lovely bright decorations. Can be hooked up easily. Need to be unpacked carefully to prevent tangling. Speedy delivery."
4294,1314,5," Attractive and fun bought with lots of other things to decorate house& but these look really cool dangling from ceiling"
4295,1314,5," Great quality product and really added a lovely atmosphere to the party& love the colour.Prompt delivery."
4296,1315,2," Poor quality balloons - about 1/4 of them burst as they were blown up. Also& the pack was entirely tardis pictures& not a mixture as the picture shows."
4297,1315,2," These balloons are not as advertised. Only the TARDIS is pictured on the balloons& no daleks or cybermen. They're also very thin& not great quality."
4298,1315,5," i like these balloons. i bought them for a Doctor Who themed thing and they just added a great finishing toutch."
4299,1315,4," These balloons were a huge hit at my Nephew's birthday party. Loved them and would buy them again next year!"
4300,1315,5," Can't go wrong with balloons - great item and all the better that they were on offer."
4301,1315,5," I also used these at my party. Sadly they are all gone. No needed complains!"
4302,1315,5," Lovely balloons& just the job for a Doctor Who fanatics birthday."
4303,1315,4," Son loved these& bought for his birthday would use seller again"
4304,1316,5," Just what I was looking for. Perfect for mixing the numbers& in this case '40'. Large and noticeable! Delivery was quick& too."
4305,1316,5," Great ...amazing colour and size!"
4306,1317,5," These balloons were deliverd really fast& I have brought the blue pack and pink pack. Happy with the purchase and not a bad price"
4307,1317,5," Yes kids love this haha for fun balloon is ok and easy to blew up.i put this when we celebrate the cristining for my daughter"
4308,1318,5," Very pleased"
4309,1319,5," Purchased three of these as table decoration for my husband's 'special' birthday party: they looked absolutely terrific on the tables and were just the right height so that cross-table conversation was possible without obstacles in the way.  They made the tables look very attractive.  Very pleased with this purchase"
4310,1320,5," Just what I was looking for& for my 40th birthday& fits and looks great can't wait to wear it& and such a great price too well pleased !"
4311,1321,5," Was chuft with these& they added that little something extra rather than just balloons to my 3yr old daughters party & they looked well & hanged well . Ordered on a tues"
4312,1321,5," these where great! hung them up on in our hallway so when my daughter woke up in the morning and came down stairs this is what she saw - they come down quite low for adults if you have normal size ceilings  - so adults had to dodge out of the way but they did the job and lit up my daughters face and the other children faces!  - you get 6 with cardboards pics and 12 or more twirls with nothing  but would highly recommend"
4313,1321,5," Bought these for a charity party.  Everyone loved them and gave them to a colleague who's daughter was having a frozen party. Big thumbs up."
4314,1321,5," Brought for daughters birthday all her friends loved them... And so did she.. looked amazing well worth it to finsh up a frozen party :)"
4315,1321,5," Really good decorations and looked lovely. Unfortunately I stuck them to roof with Sellotape so didn't take long to fall back down."
4316,1321,4," Very pleased with the quality of this product. They certainly created a Frozen theme to our daughters 6 birthday party. A big hit."
4317,1321,5," Fabulous decorations looked great at my daughters party. Needed a bit of unravelling before use so leave some time unlike us :)"
4318,1321,5," excellent customer services& would recommend  this seller"
4319,1322,5," Durable balloon& hard wearing for 1 year olds to bang about& great gift for a peppa pig fan& will buy again"
4320,1322,5," Nice balloon."
4321,1323,5," What a great balloon!  Completely surprised my 7 yr old! And his friends enjoyed ripping his limbs off!  Don't worry though he dies stick back together. I'm more surprised he didn't pop!  2 days since the party the Red Mystic Force Ranger stands proudly in our window protecting the house from 'Octomus' (I'm reliably informed!)."
4322,1323,5," Perfect and on time"
4323,1324,5," All seems ok .... Not used yet as it's for next month"
4324,1325,5," They are what they are and do what they state on the tin"
4325,1325,4," Arrived early and sensibly packadged & they seem fine"

4332,1328,5," Excellent buy"
4333,1329,5," I would buy again"
4334,1330,4," Good quality balloons& blown up to a decent size with plenty on the end to knot it and tie them together with a piece of string.Pinned them outside and it was quite breezy and they stayed inflated for two full days."
4335,1330,5," Arrived in really good time& will be perfect for my dads 60th birthday.  Just need to get him out of the house to set it up"
4336,1330,4," These balloons were delivered quickly by the supplier. They look really stylish& especially when arranged in groups of three one of each colour. However& I could not give them 5 starts because two of the white balloons had holes in them and I could not use them. The light and dark blue were not affected. They held the air and kept blown up for the duration of the party and a few days after."
4337,1330,5," Quick delivery service& I blew them up the day before my partners birthday tied them up together they are still inflated after 8 days& haven't gone down much& very pleased with these balloons. I would recommend."
4338,1330,5," highly recommend this seller & these balloons were vibrant colours and were strong and these are medium size when blown up &they didnt pop and lasted all night & I was more than happy with these balloons"
4339,1330,5," These balloons are well worth their money& easy to blow up and they just last and last and last!!  In the end 2 months after the event I reluctantly had to burst them!!Buy them!!"
4340,1330,2," When you purchase advise to blow up the day before and put them outside to air - they smell of petrol chemicals like gloss paint and it will fill your room for many hours."
4341,1330,5," these ballons stayed blowed up for several days afterwards& and was very good quality. would recommend these balloons. good balloons"
4342,1331,1," Some of order missing. Ballons i got were all dirty so couldnt use. Emailed seller got no reply."
4343,1331,5," Brilliant product& good value pack and excellent quality too. I kept the banners whole rather than cutting them and they looked great across two walls."
4344,1331,5," Great  little package& de"
4345,1332,5," Received today"
4346,1333,4," Balloon fitted in well with our birthday theme but didn't stay inflated as long as others we bought. Good quality."
4347,1333,5," Great"
4348,1334,5," I bought this balloon to go with a '2' for my daughters 21st. It was delivered quickly and well packaged.At 40 inches it is indeed big and just perfect for what I wanted/envisaged. The silver is a shiny/glossy silver and not dull or matt finish& so it looks great! The balloon was  perfect on the day and everybody commented on the '21'! I know from experience it will stay afloat for a week afterwards when filled with Helium (from Amazon). They will be released a week later to float off to . . .somewhere? :)Highly recommended"
4349,1335,5," received more balloons than I expected which was a pleasant bonus& turned up on time& pleased with product&ps the balloons were better quality then the picture shows them to be"
4350,1336,4," Good product"
4351,1337,5," Brilliant balloons& didn't burst& stayed up for ages despite attacks from many 5 year olds - highly recommend."
4352,1338,2," All popped before party started& very disappointing quality& such a shame as werent chrap. approached seller with feedback& told must have blown them up too much!! no refund offered. wouldnt buy from here again. Very disappointing."
4353,1338,2," These balloons were for a birthday and ordered in plenty of time.  They eventually arrived far too late to be of use and alternatives had to be bought the day before."
4354,1338,2," When my 5 balloons arrived through the post..one was packed completely ripped..so could only use 4.. Bit disappointed ...fab size tho .."
4355,1338,5," This is bought for a little girl having a princess party and she loves these colours so fabulous for her"
4356,1338,5," Balloons very pretty& ideal for my daughter's princess party. Arrived very quickly."
4357,1339,3," I got these for my mum's birthday to go on top of her cake. I ordered pink sparklers and ended up with sliver also& they take ages to light and by the time we sent the cake out we managed a quick 'happy birthday' song before they went out. someone in my family said 'is that it?'. however there was fast delivery and they did look really good on the cake it's just a shame they didn't last longer& I probably would buy these again if I had another birthday."
4358,1339,5," i have now tryed both the pink and the blue candles and i have to say a1 they burn for about 45 secs and the colour of the flame is the same as the candle I.E the pink ones burn pink and the blue one&s burn blue great fun and my kids loved them i will by againthanks ellICE FOUNTAIN CANDLES PINK& BLUE& SILVER"
4359,1339,5," Even my cynical 44yr old brother& who prides himself on never being impressed with anything& light up with glee when his cake arrived with two of these sparkling away.They are brilliant!"
4360,1339,5," These candles seem to last a lot longer than others I have bought which was a pleasant surprise. However& expect more smoke as a result so best to light them in a fairly well ventilated room."
4361,1340,5," I give this 5 stars as nothing to dislike& came quickly was good for the day& ok price etc so no complaints"
4362,1340,3," nice badge"
4363,1341,4," I'm getting married bonfire night and wanted a subtle but theme based balloon holder. These boxes will definitely do the job."
4364,1341,5," Good value for money.  Did the job and looked great on the table as part of the centrepiece.Would recommend."
4365,1341,4," The blue stars don't stand out as much as i thought they woul"
4366,1341,4," ideal for parties"
4367,1342,5," Great value party pack& received in good time and made the birthday boy very happy when he woke up to find the banners and balloons up and the huge badge along with the candle in his cake."

4376,1345,5," Good value for money."
4377,1346,1," Terrible quality& small& difficult to blow up and then they exploded for no apparent reason an hour later. Were not usable."
4378,1346,4," 5 stars would have been given however 2 balloons in the pack had holes in them.These balloons are ideal for making a cheap grape fancy dress costume :) Recommended"
4379,1346,5," These balloons are very well made& consisting of thicker material than most balloons. They also have no powdery / chemical taste when blown up using your mouth."
4380,1346,5," Good size and quality was able to insert sweets and other goodies for Halloween game & have bought them a few times 10/10"
4381,1347,5," The badge was great value for money"
4382,1348,5," Do what they are supposed to and arrived quickly"
4383,1349,3," Un inflated they looked emerald green and i was wondering if i"
4384,1349,5," Ordered for son's birthday BBQ! Arrived promptly& great quality and price! Still inflated after several days of being outside in our fabulous Great British weather so can't fault them! Would recommend!"
4385,1349,5," These balloons looked great at our son's 5th Birthday party recently.  We used them in conjunction with bright orange and dark green balloons. Very pleased with the quality and thickness of them."
4386,1349,5," THESE WERE A LOVELY GREEN AND A GREAT BALLOON& THEY BLOW UP TO A REALLY GOOD SIZE AND WERE EASY TO USE. I ALSO USED DARK GREEN AND ORANGE& TO GO WITH THE DINOSAUR THEME FOR MY SON'S PARTY."
4387,1349,5," These are fab balloons& big"
4388,1349,5," Bought for my nephews 3rd birthday party. He loves balloons anyway but the fact they were green made it even better for him!"

4393,1353,5," Wow balloons that are printed the correct way so you can read them without standing on your head when they have been hung up. Great value for money."
4394,1353,5," delighted with product stayed up for over two weeks"
4395,1353,1," Bought these because of the reviews and the picture showing printing.Unlike first reviewer my 40 balloons are all printed so when they hang the writing is upside down. Very disappointed."
4396,1353,5," Excellent balloons"
4397,1353,5," These will be nice for mymums special birthday this year."
4398,1353,5," Blown up on nov. 1st and still not gone down!"
4399,1354,5," Brilliant addition to a party"
4400,1354,4," Was really good and very loud"
4401,1355,3," They are cheap and do the job but if you are expecting high quality balloons that blow up big then these are not for you."
4402,1355,4," These balloons were for my Diamond Jubilee Party on the 2nd June.Delivery was fast and efficient / post free which is what I like.We all know the weather was horrible so we put up a gazzebo so the balloons looked good with the rest of the decorationsGood night was had by allValerie L"
4403,1355,5," These balloons arrived promptly& were inexpensive and stayed fully inflated for over a week (they may have lasted even longer but we had to take them down!) An excellent purchase."
4404,1355,5," 20 balloons for a great price& they do the job blew up to a good size and stayed up a few days& a few left to make big ice marbles in winter time.Would recommend these great for any occasion"
4405,1355,4," This item did what it says on the tin. They are& after all balloons and therefore they 'ballooned' well. Not sure what else one can add."
4406,1355,4," Did the job required for a 4th of July celebration held on 6th July& due to need for the party to be at week end."
4407,1355,4," Didnt think you would get 20 get value balloons better than the one you would pay more than 70 p for"
4408,1355,1," Bought this for a street party this Summer& balloons filled easily enough& tied them in bunches to decorate the garden& all looked really pretty& but all popped one by one within half an hour of being blown up - they were not filled up too much nor placed near anything that might damage them& so can't understand why this happened. But very disappointing& especially for the children!"
4409,1356,5," Cheap for birthday party"
4410,1357,5," loved these balloons and they for lasted ages& could definitely order again for another birthday or recommend to a friend"
4411,1357,5," A Sophisticated Range -Different from the normal colour range - more sophisticated and looked great. Would recommend these for 21st birthday do."
4412,1357,3," I purchased this item to add to a load of other party pieces. The balloons were large& thick and well printed on.Delivery was fast and no complaints here at all."
4413,1357,5," The 21 is very clear and the  balloons blew up quite large. They balloons were quite strong and lasted the wholw ay and night. They looked great when blown up."
4414,1357,5," Good quality balloons&  got them for my daughters birthday party& lasted way longer after the event had to burst them in the end.!"
4415,1357,5," love these balloons as the material is tough so you can blow them really big& worked well at my boyfriends surprise party."
4416,1357,5," Quality balloon& looks great easy to inflate! They last for days after the event and look fantastic with other balloons."
4417,1357,3," The balloons took a week longer to arrive than advertised. I contacted the seller to find out where they were and was asked to wait 5 more days. When they finally arrived they were packaged into a very small bag which I assume must have been lost in a mail bag and then found. I bigger bag needs to be used in future. Haven't opened the product yet as for my daughter's 21st birthday this month."
4418,1358,3," Balloons came in time and where the perfect colour. Unfortunately there were a few with holes in them and a few that didn't have a proper end to tie . Obviously didn't find this out till the morning of our party which left us short"
4419,1358,5," Used these for a baby shower& the theme was pink& blue and yellow and these were a lovely light yellow colour. Good quality and excellent delivery"
4420,1358,5," Excellent quality& lovely colour& has stayed highly inflated for over a week so far! Would definitely recommend."
4421,1358,3," Some were faulty- had holes in them or the top of the balloon was missing"
4422,1358,5," good balloons but quite sensitive to bursting when inflated"
4423,1358,5," Good quality and price with quick delivery"
4424,1358,4," Nice and brightly coloured"
4425,1359,5," Great balloon& I used helium in mine l& inflated really well. My son will love it"
4426,1359,5," Great quality balloon. Stayed afloat with helium for over four weeks!"
4427,1359,5," Love this balloon. It come so quick too. My aon loves it."
4428,1359,5," Really lovely balloon. Looks great when up with helium."
4429,1360,5," Amazing product! Floated for 4 weeks. And then just re injected some gas and it looks like new again! It's not closed with a node so it's really straight forward"
4430,1361,5," These actually look a lot better than in the picture. The clue is in the name - there's confetti inside the ribbon's middle& which is a little dome. These look very cute and I'm sure they'll go down a treat with four year olds at an upcoming birthday party."
4431,1361,5," I bought these at 6p each directly from Amazon (or at least fulfilled by Amazon) - actually just as a way to top a group of items up to Â£20 for the free postage!For 6p I'm very happy.  It doesn't quite look like the picture as it has a plastic bubble with some circles and stars in front of the octopus and also the blue colour is a bit lighter shade (which is a nicer shade for kids in my opinion).The back of the badge is a sticker - which unfortunately my 5-year old decided to stick onto his monitor - so I'm hoping the glue won't turn out to be too strong."
4432,1361,5," Absolutely great item. I bought 10 of these for my son's 4th birthday so we can put them on his friends. The pictures looked amazing with everyone having one on.Great price& speedy delivery and fantastic products for the 4 yr olds!!!"
4433,1361,5," Great product and better than the picture shows& the centre of the rosette is actually a clear dome containing confetti. Great for any Octonauts fan&"
4434,1362,5," This was fab on Halloween& I managed to get 30 scary cupcakes on it!!!  It comes apart easily& to store neatly away until next Halloween& when this cake stand will definately take pride of place in the centre of the table again."
4435,1362,5," Exactly what you see is what you get and I am very happy.  It is good quality and just as colourful.  I am looking forward to displaying my cakes on it at our Halloween party this week."
4436,1362,5," Arrived in good time and was ideal for displaying my cup cakes. These stands are great for parties adding a bit of fun and colour. Also fold flat for storage afterwards."
4437,1362,4," It looks great and easy to put together& not so easy to take apart for storage& it didn't rip or anything but may do the next time I want to put it away after using it."
4438,1362,3," This is a cheap and cheerful cake stand& quite sturdy and did the job& shame the cake cases I ordered to match were completely different ... ..."
4439,1362,5,""
4440,1362,4," Great cake stand! - However& you can pick these up at the poundshops. Not worth Â£5."
4441,1362,5," Quick delivery really happy with purchase thanks."
4442,1363,5," It hasn't left my granddaughters side&day or night !!!!"
4443,1364,4," Very colorful& would have preferred to be able to get them in one colour rather than multicolored& however& my daughter was thrilled with them& I on the other hand must remember to buy a pump for next year!!!!....... My cheeks are killing me!!"
4444,1364,4," pleased with item"
4445,1365,5," Good value for money and plays a loud happy birthday song. Kids love it but we overfilled with helium which caused it to pop after 2 days(didn't realize how much helium expands& only fill 3/4).A big size and very colourful and if filled correctly I guess it would last a few weeks."
4446,1366,4," good as balloons can go"
4447,1367,5," does the job no complains."
4448,1368,4," these were good quality ballons which were a good price but we had to pay to have them blown up at a shoip"
4449,1369,5," quick delivery & good value"
4450,1370,5," came the next day what more can i say!not used them yet but they look great.great service as usual!"
4451,1370,5," Description accurate and value for money"
4452,1370,5," excellent many thanks"

4457,1373,5," Good."
4458,1373,5," Good"
4459,1374,5," A1& Thanks"
4460,1375,5," Really pleased with the product. They don't open up like a standard cards& but& rather& they are folded twice and open up long - very nice and appropriate for a child's birthday party. There is also space to write the date of the party& location& RSVP info& etc. Highly recommended for the price. I never received the notification from Amazon that the item was dispatched& so I contacted the seller& who dealt with the issue very very promptly& and I receive the package on time and without any issues. Thanks!"
4461,1375,3," its a nice invitation card& it has three sections& 1 the one you can see here on the picture& the middle one has some balloons on it and the third basic data of the party. the only negative is& that there is no space to write your own comment/poem unless you  write it on the back of the card. i just used the middle section where balloons are and wrote it over it& but it just doesnt look very nice... :(Personally i wouldnt get these cards again."
4462,1375,4," Good quality . Prompt service and excellent price. Ample writing space and fold out design is good . Highly recommended ."
4463,1375,5," we just love it ... nice quality&good space on it...and really good price compared with the others !!!"
4464,1375,5," Lovely invites& with plenty of space in the middle to stick label/paper with additional information."
4465,1376,5," This kit was great for keeping the kids occupied over the Easter holidays and it came very quickly too. Made 12 fairy cakes and 12 chocolate rice Krispie nests. Children loved to help and decorate with the fun themed sticks."
4466,1376,1," Not sure what kind of cupcake will survive in these tiny cases. If you know of a recipe that will suit this size& please let me know so that I can enjoy my otherwise useless cupcake cases."
4467,1376,5," Finished of my easter cupcakes turning them into something extra special"
4468,1376,5," Lovely little Easter Baking kit& great little easter basket filler :-)"
4469,1377,4," These were lovely and the closest I could get for a 101 dalmation themed 5 year olds party! Only one thing& there was no line to say who the invite was from! Packaged well and came quickly!"
4470,1378,5," The cases went down a storm they where very durable and did not split like other cup cases I have used before"
4471,1379,4," Well printed& fitting cover and good design.Expected to have an paper option to write down big messages instead of pre-printed blanks to fill in. Apart from that& I totally liked it and used it for my son's 4th Birthday"
4472,1380,5," Bought for my son's first birthday& this candle fitted the bill perfectly. Admittedly he would have been equally delighted with a lump of play dough on his cake& but the adults thought it was cute. It's a decent size& chunky and colourful.Oh yes& and you get a wish when you blow it out! I blew it out on behalf of my son& and two minutes later a Ferrari appeared outside the front of the house with my name on the keys. Worth the price of the candle for the wish alone..."
4473,1380,5," This candle looked great on the birthday cake - very different from the small normal candles. Perfect for a 1st birthday event!"
4474,1380,1," Not like the photo & it is a different design & it is fine but it is completely different one"
4475,1380,5," Love this candle& it's really nicely made and a lovely design."
4476,1381,5," As expected arrivered very fast and the invitation are good for what u paid"

4490,1384,5," Lovely quality and so cute for a little girls party - not the most amount of space to write but had a lot of comments on how nice the invitations are.  Good price"
4491,1385,4," I brought for my daughters 3rd birthday party as she is crazy about Roary and absolutely loved them.. My only disappointment about them is that they are quite difficult to write on as the paper is quite dark and abit filmy.. so thick black pen was needed."

4503,1388,3," These looked the part but had them inflated at clintons and they had droop within the hour& may be the heat."

4507,1389,5," came on time very pleased"
4508,1390,5," Nice size balloon arrived before delivery date happy customer"
4509,1391,4," I think a pack of 5 is too little. And if you get a second pack or more& the colors are very repetitive. Like I would get one white in every 2 or 3 packs. Same with the Red.I believe there should be an option to get a pack of ten or more and colors are more or less diveded equally."
4510,1391,4," Good quality got for little boys 3rd birthday party and he loved them. Did the job so would recommend!! Zxxxx"
4511,1392,5," I love these balloons - always strong and the pearlized makes it even better"

4514,1393,5," Arrived as said."
4515,1394,5," These balloons are good quality and new to me.  I  bought them for someone raising money for charity and will consider reordering for my self.  I make balloon models for charity."
4516,1395,1," they were not worth the money as they burst 5 minutes after they were blown up&1 after the other"
4517,1395,5," Extra strong large celebration balloons& keeping the grand children amused for months!!!!"
4518,1395,5," They are good quality and very responsibly priced."
4519,1396,5," Great service and product exactly what I was looking for.  I used them with hi-float and helium for a friends 60th birthday party and they looked fantastic on the night."
4520,1396,5," Happy with product"
4521,1397,5," Shipping was very fast and packaged very neatly. I purchased it with the seller tiger feet& Balloon itself is extremely cute and well made. Filled it up with air days ago and hasn't changed a bit."
4522,1397,5," Awesome!!!"

4531,1401,3," I ordered these balloons for my son's birthday party a month in advance but they arrived a month late so useless for another year. If I had realised it would have taken so long I wouldn't have ordered them.***The supplier has since contacted me to let me know they are very sorry for the delay in delivery and have refunded the cost of the item& which I take as a goodwill gesture and this is appreciated. I can only re-iterate that free is useless when there are no balloons at a party. Prompt service is my normal experience of purchases through Amazon. Everything I ordered from John Lewis in the week before Christmas came within 2 days for free to local Waitrose."
4532,1401,5," Great product arrived as stated& all filled with gas. At the end of the day its a balloon and done what a balloon does."
4533,1401,3," Arrived in time great. We were using them not as balloons but as vibrating membranes on yogophones (Single note scrap instruments.) They were nice and big but the latex was liable to tear when manually stretched. If you just want blow up balloons they are  great"
4534,1401,2," The balloons arrived before the expected time. The quality was rubbish and they were not 12 inch size. This was very disappointing as they were going on display with other balloons. They also went down quite quickly. Pay more and buy different ones."
4535,1401,1," I ordered 100 orange Balloons and 50 Black Balloons for a kids halloween Party I was very disappointed when I opened the package to find that there was only 50 orange and 46 Black defo will not be buying again"
4536,1401,5," These are really excellent quality balloons. We used them for a kids party and at the end we wanted the kids to burst them by stamping on them as part of a game. They are so strong& this was a real challenge."
4537,1401,5," I used these for a Halloween party then had loads left over so used them at my black and gold themed new year party! Looked fantastic both times& didn't burst or deflate either!"
4538,1401,5," These balloons were great quality and arrived very quickly.  I bought the cerise ones as well and the two together looked wonderful for our pirates and princesses party."
4539,1402,5," Just great. Good quality ballons& quite big and last over a month& which can be a good or bad thing."
4540,1402,5," Difficult to get age 11 birthday stuff so was very pleased to find this."
4541,1402,5," Thank you very much."
4542,1402,5," great"
4543,1403,5," Good size and strong. Loved this item thanks."
4544,1403,5," Lovely balloons"
4545,1404,1," So disappointed! When arrived number candle was completely snapped into several pieces and weeks later when I blew up balloons. 5 out of 8 of them instantly deflated had holes in them. Not happy"
4546,1404,3," All the balloons went down really quickly. Rest of the stuff was good."
4547,1404,5," Arrived very quickly. Would recommend this"
4548,1404,5," Good price for nice little set."
4549,1405,5," :)"
4550,1406,4," Bargin for the price and looked fantastic with the yellow balloons i got for my sons wall-e themed party& was nice to have different balloons!! and are still floating around a week and a half later :)"
4551,1406,5," The balloons are an excellent buy. They are easily inflated and there is a lot of spare at the end so knotting them is easy. Superb Balloons."
4552,1406,5," We're good quality and lasted longer than cheaper ones. We were happy with them. They were used for a pirate game called cannonball clash& and the kids were supposed to burst each others balloons. The game took longer than expected& because the balloons wouldn't burst!"
4553,1406,2," Very bad quality& smelt horrible and black paint came off and stained mouth/fingers after blowing them up. Will not buy them again."
4554,1406,5," Very thick high quality balloons hard to blow up as so thick. I bought them to use with a laser to show ths dangers of laser pointers but they are to thick to pop!"
4555,1407,5," Thick& quality& latex balloons& well made and professional looking.  Looked very nice displayed on wall on New Years Eve night."
4556,1407,5," was really pleased with the excellent service& they arrived very quickly and i will definitely use them again for other things"
4557,1407,4," not used yet but looks good quality fast delivery thankyou"
4558,1407,5," good ballons still blown up and we are in March !"
4559,1407,5," good quality&arrived before new years eve&happy"
4560,1408,5," Arrived quickly& exactly as expected. Thank you!"
4561,1409,4," This hello Kitty balloon was added to the Christmas decorations to make it extra special for my granddaughter who adores Hello Kitty. It certainly made her smile."
4562,1410,5," was perfect for daughters wedding cake thankyou"
4563,1411,5," I deal with balloons on a regular basis and this product was brilliantDelivery was fast too and it wasn't even in the UKMy daughter was over the moon as she had a despicable me themed party"
4564,1411,5," These balloons were great and deliver time was fast.  My daughter loved these for her despicable me themed party (and so did her friends)"
4565,1411,5," good quality& bright nice colors. really cute.very fast delivery."
4566,1412,4," Perfect"
4567,1412,5," Good"
4568,1413,5," This was an excellent buy is terms of Foil Balloons. After it was inflated it stayed up for many weeks after. Great buy."
4569,1413,5," A balloon is a balloon. All the same& it is a good one and my son and his friends loved it!"
4570,1413,1," Had this balloon blown up and it just went bang in the mans hand very very disappointed"
4571,1414,3," Good price"
4572,1414,5," Brilliant& great for baby shower! Great price and fast delivery!"
4573,1415,5," Awesome quality!"
4574,1416,1," Don't get me wrong they do the job. But actually after paying nearly as much as the actual balloon weights for delivery they arrived Squashed and half of them didn't have the loops on to attach the ballon to anyways which made them rather pointless. And the ones that did have the attatchment loops on we're so damaged that when we did attatch balloons to them they hung awkwardly& however with my sisters 18th birthday only a few days away when they finally arrived the balloons ended up looking more drunk that she did. I would definitely not recommend."
4575,1416,5," I purchased these& after seeing that to separately buy 12 balloon weights& I'd be looking at Â£1 to Â£2 EACH!. At the end of the day& they are just balloon weights.You probably won't be using them that often& so even if it is one use& at just over Â£6 for 12 weights is excellent.They arrived packaged tightly in a box. None were damaged& and just needed a little fluffing up to make them look decent. They did the job of holding down 3x latex helium filled balloons per weight. They have since been lent out to a friend who also used them at her party.So& my conclusion is that they represent fantastic value for money"
4576,1416,5," Fast delivery& exactly as pictured& but with a clear acetate ring hidden in the tassels to attach balloons to. I did pity the postie having to carry two boxfulls to my house though!"
4577,1416,2," Not too happy with these but have to keep as party is tomorrow.Delivery was good but quality of product is not so good.  they are quite small and seem to differ in sizes"
4578,1416,5," Wasn't too sure about the reviews but I have to say they were fantastic. Was able to attach three helium filled balloons to them. Could possibly have added more."
4579,1416,3," Smaller than the standard size you would buy in the shop& so not such good value& however the quality seems fine and will do the job."
4580,1416,5," Got them for my sons engagement every one loved them and a lot of people asked where to get them from so we tell them thank you"
4581,1416,5," Excellent quality and excellent price.. Very impressed and would highly recommend"
4582,1417,5," These are great for Christmas& new year or party's. All ages love them from children to  older people& it does help to have a pump as they are hard to blow up the first time. You blow them up and aim them at people they fly across the room and can be fired back at you."
4583,1418,5," .i97ygftgyhlp"
4584,1419,5," I've bought these for my lovely fiancee's surprise 50th birthday do in May (Shhhh!)There are 50 balloons that can be inflated upto 12 inches which is quite large. I've tried a few with air (lung power!) and they are very good. Great quality and the Orange colour is nice and vibrant& just what I wanted! On the day I will be using Helium to inflate these so I can decorate the tables with them. So after all is done and dusted I will update this review with some info of how they performed and a few pics! Very happy with these and can recommend"
4585,1419,5," Bought these for a friend whose company was having a charity event& she was thrilled with them.  The size when blown up was really big!"
4586,1419,3," The metallic orange was very nice and matched well for my Halloween balloon archway& but they're nowhere near 12 inches in diameter.  Either that or they aren't helium quality like the pack suggested.  I was only able to inflate them to 8/9| before several popped so I just made all the balloons smaller.  Shame because the colour really is nice."
4587,1419,3," In less than 12hrs& they are not supporting themselves after being filled with helium. The balloons were tied and tied again with tight ribbon.On a semi positive& only 1 balloon had a hole in it although I suppose that should have been zero"
4588,1419,5," it got bigger the more i blew it"
4589,1419,4," Good product& and worth the price"
4590,1420,5," This balloon is huge my grandson loved it and he's still playing with it almost 3 weeks after his birthday party. Delivery was prompt and good price."
4591,1420,5," Good quality balloon my 3 yr old son will love it."
4592,1420,4," It's lovely"
4593,1421,5," Very sophisticated looking balloons. As described. Blew up easily and haven't deflated a week later. Arrived promptly so would recommend the company to anyone and the product."
4594,1421,5," Excellent value and quality"
4595,1421,5," Excellent"
4596,1422,5," Very good quality and a very low price so one can't complain either way"
4597,1423,5," Fabulous balloons& great |pirate| colours& red& yellow& white and black (2 of each colour)& with the archetypal skull and cross bones (jolly roger) printed on them& just what you need for a Pirate Party.The colours are bright& and the quality is excellent& filled with helium easily and went down a treat at the party or should I say up..Highly recommended."
4598,1423,5," Great set of balloons with nice clear graphic and vibrant colours. Balloons were strong enough to withstand a lot of playing by 4year olds and there were plenty left at the end of the party for guests to be able to take them home!"
4599,1423,4," Lovely brightly coloured balloons (red& yellow& white and black) that went down a treat at my son's pirate themed birthday party!"
4600,1423,5," Balloons were of a much nicer quality then others bought from elsewhere.  Nice fun colours and nice simple design.  A good buy."
4601,1423,4," Large-sized good quality balloons in 4 colours (red& yellow& white and black) perfect for my 4 year old's pirate themed party!"
4602,1423,5," Balloons arrived promptly and i was really pleased with them. They blew up easily and was easily tied. Worth the money"
4603,1423,5," brilliant I so cant wait to have them all up ready for my sons birthday next week he is very excited"
4604,1423,4," nice variety of colours and the design was perfect for the pirate party"
4605,1424,4," Great for Grand Prix party"
4606,1424,5," still up after a week"
4607,1424,5," Big strong balloons."
4608,1424,5," Brilliant"
4609,1425,5," Great"
4610,1426,5," gOOD QUALITY i WAS PLEASED WITH IT AND ALSO MY SON WHO HAD JUST COME HOME FROM THE ARMY ON LEAVE."
4611,1426,5," good product bought as a gift and the intended person liked it very much thank you will buy another soon"
4612,1426,5," Product came the next day.  Balloon lasted and lasted - had to pop it in the end after several weeks!"
4613,1426,5," Great balloon"
4614,1427,4," Excellent product - purchased these for my son's 5th birthday party. Gave each child a helium-filled balloon to take home along with a party bag of goodies. They were a great hit& great idea& made it really easy for the children to carry balloons home without losing them. Would have awarded 5 stars& however& only received 9 bangles and didn't realise until party day so 1 disappointed child."
4615,1427,5," really good value for money. used it to give all the kids a helium filled balloon each to take home at my son's bday party! Some of the girls liked it so much & they wore it as bangles! Would definately buy it again!"
4616,1427,1," Not at all the colours they show on the foto. The colours were dull!"
4617,1427,5," Good quality& quick delivery and kids loved them. Would recommend."
4618,1427,5," Holds down the helium balloons and big enough to wear as a bangle."
4619,1427,5," Didn't lose any balloons this year& well worth the buy!"
4620,1427,3," they are o.k. did not realise they would be so big"
4621,1428,5," My daughter was delighted to receive this on her 4th birthday& complete with lovely box"
4622,1429,1," I got the balloons today and i am so disappointed. I asked for a pack of 10 pink balloons and i have got different coloured ballons in a white envelope today. The balloons were not even in a packet and one was stuck to the envelope and when i tried to remove it& i ended up with a hole in the balloon. I felt as tho no care was taken in sending the balloons and the reason i ordered them was because the theme is PINK! not blue& yellow& green etc. The heading does say 10 PINK balloons not 10 multi-coloured balloons."
4623,1429,5," arrived propmtly.a good price but probably could've got them for that if i could be bothered to trawl the high street.they did smell when first opened so gave a bit of an airing&couldnt smell them once they were blown up after a while"
4624,1429,5," I thought at first that these balloons were a bit expensive for 10 but found when they arrived that they were good quality.  We used them for an outdoor party and they survived a couple of days outside and did not deflate at all."
4625,1429,3," These balloons look great - but word of warning take them out the bag OUTSIDE and let them air before you blow them up - unless you really love the small of latex!"
4626,1429,5," Large bright balloons - perfect for drawing attention to embarrassing posters and banners that your 18 year old daughter will cringe at :)"
4627,1429,4," I would recommend this product to anyone as the balloons are of a high quality and are very pretty.  They will be perfect for my party."
4628,1430,3," These we ok as far as balloons go. A couple popped when blowing them up but that's balloons. Isn't it"
4629,1430,5," Arrived in good time& good quality balloons !"
4630,1431,5," Brill"
4631,1432,5," great value for money& all balloons in good condition& for the price they were better quality than expected& we used them with helium and most stayed up for around 24hrs"
4632,1432,5," Item as described& Many thanks"
4633,1432,5," Another good buy."
4634,1432,5," Great balloons"
4635,1433,5," Brilliant! Bought for daughters 18th. Waited until the last minute to blow up as I expected them to fade quickly... But..  Stayed alight for about 3 days!"
4636,1433,5," great!"
4637,1434,5," This is just the icing on the cake for my daughter as she love all the Mickey mouse club house anyway this foil balloon it s hear after 3 weeks of course I did ad some air to keep it up but I definetely recommend it to anyone& my daughter was playing with it it was still intact& I can completely recommend that&to everone last long& size is ok and fast delivery& thanks"
4638,1434,5," The balloon looked very nice& our 4 year old daughter loved it!"
4639,1434,5," Lovely balloon!"
4640,1435,5," These are great value and good quality balloons my son loved them. Good price I would definitely recommend them to anyone."
4641,1436,5," Bought two bags for a bridal shower and had plenty left over& good size and at a bargain price. They also arrived in good time so highly recommended."
4642,1436,5," Incredible quality and value! At Â£1.91 for 25 balloons& this is the cheapest I've found anywhere for the perfect coloured balloons for my daughter's birthday. Incredible quality because although her Birthday was in January& we STILL have some inflated to a good size& some four months later that she plays with in the house. Large size too. Extremely impressed and will order again& with no doubt!"
4643,1436,5," The balloons were really good quality and we were very happy with them. Would purchase again x although the review options above aren't really relevant as states toy!?"
4644,1436,5," Item as described and arrived quickly.  Good quality and withstood 5 year olds playing with them without popping!  Would recommend."
4645,1436,5," great quality - absolutely massive - still have half the packet left for next party& quick delivery - well worth the price"
4646,1436,3," I ordered these for a 50th birthday party. I used to be a professional balloon artist so do the odd party for friends etc.I found these to be of fairly low quality for using with helium. Many of these burst well before they should have reached their maximum capacity. Good job I ordered two sets or would not have had enough.They worked well if blown up using air and the kids loved playing with them but not the quality I needed."
4647,1436,1," Consisted of 3 ripped balloons whilst the others varied in quality. 15 of them were unusable as they inflated in odd shapes. Utterly disappointed in this product. Complete waste of money and time. Had to rush out and buy random balloons which didn't match my theme."
4648,1436,5," Bought these for a halloween costume to be honest. They seem like any other regular latex balloons. They're sturdy& don't pop easily and the shade is pretty cool. We've not used helium to inflate them so can't tell you how well they would fare with that."
4649,1437,4," My partner bought these for us last year as we were having a Halloween party in our house and we only had a strict budget to work with.The stickers are made of high quality material that's fit for purpose. They are well made& have a nice design and good quality artwork.Applying the stickers to the correct locations was reasonably straightforward and the bubbles generated underneath the stickers were easy to get rid of.The product looked very good on our white toilet seat but not as effective on the black toilet seat. The feedback that we had from the party guests was of a positive nature (along with  a couple of screams!) and they hadn't seen anything as unique as it before. They didn't expect to see any props in the bathroom.The stickers were not as easy to remove and I ended up ripping the seat sticker to an unusable state. It is possible to use them again but you have to do it very slowly and carefully.I believe that the product offers good value for money given the price tag and I would therefore recommend it.Feedback:If you wish to provide feedback on this review then please follow the link below.Thanks"
4650,1437,5," Love this. Freaked everyone out& including me and I'd put it on! Really hard to fault for the price& only thing is probably just single use unless you take extreme care to remove it and keep the card to stick it back onto. I ripped mine& but will prob buy another for next party"
4651,1437,5," Absolutely brilliant& was just the right touch for my halloween party and everyone thought it looked really good. Only down side was you must be careful taking the seat picture off as it rips."
4652,1437,5," Bought for a Halloween party last year& it was perfect! It gave everyone a good laugh and added perfectly to the ghostly feeling i applied to my downstairs toilet. My little niece will probably never use my loo again though. lol"
4653,1437,5," Scary used in major film see here http:"
4654,1437,5," We all loved this. I'm always looking for new decorations to shock my son's friends and this did the trick. It really does look great - well awful really!!. Would highly recommend it."
4655,1437,5," We had a lot of screams from this on Halloween"
4656,1437,5," Kids and adults loved this product the yonger kids thought it was real ! get one for next years halloween party now.  it's a great product and it removes easily too."
4657,1438,5," Good size& good thickness of rubber& colour"
4658,1438,5," Excellent quality and they were easy to blow up.  I used them for my daughters party and they looked really good and lasted."
4659,1439,5," nice balloon& fills out nicely with helium. great quality."
4660,1439,5," Perfect balloon just shame I didn't get too see it fully inflated.  Put one too many blasts of helium in.  My fault. :)"
4661,1439,5," Amazing. My son loves it. It's perfect for a party or just for a decoration. Lord it. Thank you so much."
4662,1439,5," Very impressed& looked great"
4663,1440,5," I have purchased from this company before and as far as balloons go& I'm impressed& I always buy my birthday balloons from amazon and they always inflate and stay that way for ages. Great product will be buying again."
4664,1441,5," These are the best balloons I've ever bought. None of them burst at my 3 year olds party& they looked great and more than 3 months later& the two balloons we didn't deliberately burst have only just started to go down."
4665,1441,5," Excellent product&arrived on time as promised by supplier.."
4666,1441,5," Very good my daughter totally loved her Peppa pig balloons"
4667,1441,5," Excellent & still fully inflated after 3 weeks"

4671,1441,5," Order these for my daughters 1st birthday party lovely design"
4672,1442,5," My son is a massive curious george fan unfortunately trying to get curious george themed items in the UK is a near impossible task. I made a bulk order of party things through this company . I was a bit anxious as it was a bit pricey (supply and demand understandable ) and was coming from Canada. When it arrived (which it did very promptly ) I was very pleased I had paid the extra. All the items were fantastic quality and bright a vibrant. I had a very happy 3 year old and the parents all commented on the items."
4673,1442,5," Haven't tried these out yet& as they are for my son's birthday in a couple of weeks.  They appear to be good quality& and I am sure my little boy will be delighted to have Curious George's face on his balloons!"
4674,1442,4," These balloons were for my obsessed 2 year old curious George fan and they were ok. Just normal balloons with George's face on."
4675,1443,5," Amazing !!"
4676,1444,5," Good standard size balloon& had a good effect at venue."
4677,1445,4," was ok. as expected. (Y)"
4678,1446,5," Daughter loved these balloons for her teenage disco party. Went down well with her friends. Loved the bright colours and the price. Thank you ."
4679,1446,4," I ordered quickly and thought I was getting 6 as the picture is 6."
4680,1446,5," Fab balloons thick last a long time when blown up"
4681,1446,5," Reall bright and very coolðŸ˜€"
4682,1447,4," Lovely"
4683,1448,4," Great talking point of my party everybody loved it and and it's reusable but wouldn't class it as a TOY!!!!"
4684,1449,3," This product proved to be no use at all to me as it did not arrive on time.  Although ordered on the 23 April I thought it would arrive in time for my husbands birthday party on the 26 April.  It arrived yesterday the 29th!  A bit late dont you think so in fact it is no use to me at all.  Very disappointed."
4685,1449,5," happy"
4686,1450,5," Very easy to assemble and very effective"
4687,1451,5," I bought these as we were spending Christmas with 11 children of varying ages& they kept them busy for days until they had used every last balloon!! They arrived in good time& and were an enormous success& I am now an expert in making balloon swans and dogs!!!"
4688,1451,5," Used three bags of these balloons for team competitions on a rainy day at a kids camp - couldn't be better!"
4689,1451,5," hours and hours of enjoyment with the kids trying to make fun balloon animals - words of advice& make sure you have a balloon pump!"
4690,1451,5," These balloon are great the colors are lovely Very tough for make animal shapes ect& Very fast dispatch& would use them again"
4691,1451,2," I am really disappointed about colors. In the description they write that you have Yello& Green& Bleu& Orange& Pourple& Green claire but what I recived is.................. really not nice colors like black& kind of white but is transparent not like a baloon for children...."
4692,1451,5," I like this ballon & it is very durable and i like it so much &i can blow and shape anything with these ballons& fast delivery & good seller& thank you."
4693,1451,4," Solid product and very happy with the quality. I've not given the last star as I found the balloons did not twist together so well and needed a few more turns compared to other balloons but that's partly due to the balloons being a good quality product which had a huge advantage with respects to this warm weather we've been having as the they did not wear thin. When I need more balloons I will certainly buy again."
4694,1451,1," Advertised as qualatex balloons but cheap substitute posted& asked fir refund but none given"
4695,1452,5," Great value for money& strong balloons and lovely colour! Quick delivery and looked great at my party. Would recommend :-)"

4703,1453,5," NICE"
4704,1454,5," Wow balloons that are printed the correct way so you can read them without standing on your head when they have been hung up. Great value for money."
4705,1454,1," I ordered these for for my Nans 100th birthday and assumed from they picture they contained some gold/ yellow balloons as well as other fun colours.  The photo also shows them to have a slight shine and to look good quality. They have now arrived and were just loose inside an envelop& not even inside their own bag& and look really cheap and plain.  No lovely colours& just cheap looking balloons. Very disappointed and do not go by the photo if like me& you are expecting some gold coloured balloons."
4706,1454,4," Lovely balloons in great colours.  The writing is exactly what we wanted because we didn't want helium filled balloons& so for air filled balloons the writing is the correct way up.Only downside was that the seller sent this to the wrong address& thankfully the house number was just 1 digit out and we have understanding neighbours!"
4707,1454,3," The picture suggests that the balloons are all pink and the description doesn't say otherwise but when the balloons arrived& there was a mix of colours. The quality of the balloons is ok - none exploded on inflation - but I have seen thicker."
4708,1454,5," delighted with product stayed up for over two weeks"
4709,1454,1," Really disappointed& the picture shows the colour blue and no other colour balloons and the description doesn't mention any colours& so I purchased them on wanting blue balloons and then received a mixed colour bag!"
4710,1454,1," Bought these because of the reviews and the picture showing printing.Unlike first reviewer my 40 balloons are all printed so when they hang the writing is upside down. Very disappointed."
4711,1454,5," Excellent balolons with the writing the right way when you hand them from a string! Lovely assortment of colours. Thank you!"
4712,1455,5," Very lovely.. But wen I blew it up& it had small whole and went down.. Slowly... But will buy another n try again.. Beautiful product"
4713,1456,3," Balloons look good when blown up& however they kept spontaneously popping so we didn't have many left by the end of the night! Good scare factor& maybe.However this may be from blowing them up too large."
4714,1456,5," Great value for money--a perfect decoration. An air pump would be useful& as they do need a bit of effort to blow up yourself& but a great balloon."
4715,1456,5," good product& 10 balloons all in different variety of colours& and at a fraction of a price at most places& looked great for my sisters 21st party"
4716,1456,5," lasted a week on a boat and were perfect size"
4717,1456,3," This Balloons are doesn't stay long !!!"
4718,1457,5," Look great"
4719,1458,5," Excellent pack. Perfect for my daughters party"
4720,1458,5," Ok"
4721,1459,4," Excellent item for the summer. I used them all as mini balloons and only had one broken one out of the whole packet."
4722,1459,5," Happy"
4723,1460,5," Lovely balloon although a lot of trouble to get inflated.  Finally got local florist to do it"
4724,1461,5," Fast shipping& will make my kid happy"
4725,1462,5," What can you say about a pink balloon.... Its a nice colour of pink and it stays nicely inflated when blown up with air. I have quite a few still floating around the living room from my daughter's birthday party 13 days ago! Yeah& all in all& good balloons."
4726,1462,5," These balloons are good quality and arrived promptly. Obviously they didn't last long with a toddler in the house but she was able to jump on them a fair bit before they actually popped! Very pleased"
4727,1462,2," Balloons were bright pink& brighter than the photo and over half of them burst when we were trying to put them up. We didn't blow them up as large as we could have either."
4728,1462,3," We thought these looked great& and a nice quality and colour& but lots of them burst shortly after they were blown up. Those that didn't burst lasted well."
4729,1462,3," Nice balloons& didn't blow up particularly well& kept popping.  Those we did manage to blow up okay still look good few days later."
4730,1462,5," Lovely coloured balloons that have a strong material. Will be lovely for my wedding and fit the colour scheme perfectly"
4731,1462,1," There's had holes in and when down over night I had to rush about that morning and paying for shop brought one!ðŸ˜¡"
4732,1462,5," Very impressed and very easy to blow up& and have stayed up for over a week without helium. So would recommend."
4733,1463,5," They take a lot of |umph| to pump up. Great quality and looked wonderful! In case you are going to use these with helium and are buying the non-commercial helium tanks available on amazon/argos/highstreet - we found one tank would just about inflate 3 of these& so keep that in mind when ordering the helium."
4734,1463,4," Had trouble blowing them up as they need a lot of helium. Although measurements were attached i didnt realise i would need so much helium therefore two did not rise due to the thickness of the latex. This was more our fault than the people selling them.I would encourage people to buy them but also purchase a can of helium.Many Thanks"
4735,1463,5," Great value& looked stunning and lasted three weeks so far.  Saw similar elsewhere for loads more money& so very pleased.  Highly recommend"
4736,1463,5," Bought these for our wedding in Greece. Arrived really quickly and looked fab in all the photos.Took quite a bit of helium to fill up but did last all day once filled up properly."
4737,1463,5," Got these to keep young kids at an 18th birthday party amused. Went down a storm& even with some of the adults. Arrived in good time too. Great price for what you get."
4738,1463,1," Useless/ dangerous . Bought for a 5yo girls birthday party. I bought 6 .when the first guest arrived and it exploded on a little girls upper body's had to remove the lot . Thankfully not her face. Left big red mark.  Should be warnings. Note these where not over inflated ."
4739,1463,5," excellent worked wonderfully thank you xx i can now use what i have left over to make some carnival paper mache masks awesome xx"
4740,1463,4," Great ballons but not as round as the picture. They look more like a normal ballon. They are sturdy and will do the job."
4741,1464,5," Brilliant. Still keep inflating them 8 months on lol!!!"
4742,1464,5," My 4 year old loved them"
4743,1465,5," I wanted something nice and cheerful for my family returning from a long trip so I ordered these and well-pleased with them.The balloons are large and in bright colours - red& orange& green& blue and purple with the |Welcome Home!| printed right side up - so if you hang them from the ceiling they will be upside down.One aspect I particularly liked is the |tail| (i.e. the part near the mouth of the balloon) has a good length so it allows the balloon to be knotted instead of being tied (lasts longer IMO).Â£2 for 5 balloons is not cheap& but given the high quality of these (and the excellent service of the seller Up In Smoke) I would recommend these to anyone looking to delight a loved one returning home.Edit: 10Jun14.Its been over two months since I got these and they are STILL AROUND!I've never known balloons to last this long so I am really pleased and would definitely purchase again if needed."
4744,1465,4," I bought these for my daughter's rewturn from hospital.  They are about 30cm in diameter so nice and big - they made a great impact. Very pleased with them and would recommend to others."
4745,1465,4," as describedgood qualitylastet agesbit expensive for number in packwould buy againsuggest red white and blue instead of red white and yellow"
4746,1465,5," Balloons are as you'd expect..lovely& colourful with clear pring and well worth the money. Arrived within the estimated time too :)"
4747,1465,5," Happy with balloons. Arrived on time when they said and they look good . would recommend and would buy again."
4748,1465,5," The balloons were sturdy and a good size. It was nice that they had a 'Welcome' message printed on them."
4749,1465,5," Excellent  balloons easy to blow up and stayed up for several days"
4750,1465,5," Everything great and delivery from all& totally as promised!"
4751,1466,5," I've been looking for a set of these lights for a few years and was glad when I was able to purchase it on Amazon at long last!"
4752,1467,5," This is for my nieces bday& she is going to love it as she is doc mad. Cant wait to see her face. Good delivery time& would reccomend. Happy customer"
4753,1467,4," Thought this was great. My granddaughter loves this programme so was excited when saw. Delivered promptly and at a good price"
4754,1467,5," Great balloon& lasted forever after we had it filled. My 2 year old loves the fact he has got a Doc the same size as him!"
4755,1467,1," not good... they were happy enough to take my money but didnt send the balloon!!! very angry with them wont buy again"
4756,1467,4," Great value ballon& my daughter loved it. If you have your own helium then this is the product for you."
4757,1467,5," my daughter is a big fan -so this was near as good as all those wrapped up presents !! good value too."
4758,1467,5," Arrived on time. Very happy with this and cant wait for my little Girl to see it :-)"
4759,1467,5," Brilliant! It was blown up for her birthday in January and it's still up now :)"
4760,1468,1," Very disappointed. Bought these for my daughters home coming. It says online they can be blown up with either air or helium& but when I read the packet it says air only& I did query this with the seller& but he advised me they can be blown up with either&  so I decided to use helium so they would last longer as I had a week between two functions to celebrate. Within 3hrs of the balloons being blown up& they started to deflate. By the morning they were down. What started to be a nice surprise turned out to be a complete flop!!! I was charged Â£1per balloon to have them blown up with helium at my local shop& a complete waste of money& together with the cost of the balloons."
4761,1468,5," Really good quality - we actually had them up in situ for weeks and they still looked good and remained well inflated.  Lovely vibrant colours.  Would absolutely purchase again."
4762,1468,5," Excellent quality& balloons still inflated now almost 4 weeks after the event!! Very happy with this product. Although one did have a hole& we put some selotape over the hole to repair and even that ne has stayed up!"
4763,1468,5," Bought these balloons when my elderley mother returned from 4 months in Australia. After a month they are as good as the day we inflated them.  Well worth the reasonable purchase price."
4764,1468,5," Quality can not be faulted! Brilliant service. I was expecting them to be in a bag& when posted to me not just put in an envelope. But lovely quality balloons. They looked fab!!"
4765,1468,5," lovely  bright colours & good quality strong balloons. made lovely towers to welcome my fiance home from hospital. delighted."
4766,1468,5," Yes good for the purpose and the price. Came ig good time very reasonable. It was very popular withy everyone"
4767,1468,5," These are very bright and cheerful and have been inflated now for over 3 weeks with no sign of deflating."
4768,1469,5," bang on !"
4769,1470,5," Brilliant for the price& you will need to get it blown up and will need to buy ribbon and a weight for the end unless it's being tied. Lasts ages and my one direction mad teenage daughter loved it for her birthday celebrations."
4770,1470,5," The birthday girl loves 1D and anything connected with them so she was delighted to have 1D balloons around the room for her party."
4771,1470,5," Fab"
4772,1471,3," I got this as a present two years ago and it was alright. It only fills 3 of the containers& not 6 so a bit of a waste of money. It wasn't great or anything so I give it 3 stars. The lip balm tasted and smelled awful"
4773,1471,4," I am sure she will like it& a grand daughter that is& her mother may not!"
4774,1471,5," present"
4775,1471,5," Present"
4776,1472,5," Really prompt service and a nice quality product. Thanx"
4777,1473,5," Item arrived quickly and exactly as described.  Much easier than trying to use sellotape or drawing pins.  My only comment would be that it can be tricky to get the balloon attached without getting the adhesive area stuck to the ballon but if you arent doing it in a rush like I was then they are very useful and removed without any hassle."
4778,1473,1," I Bought these for sticking balloons up on walls for a  family 80th Birthday party they do not do what is stated on the packet& within minutes of sticking them up they keep falling down the walls were freshly painted and grease free the product is just no good."
4779,1473,5," I've used these for thousands of things to hang up around a the house for"
4780,1473,2," I bought these as I thought they would be great  for hanging up balloons for my daughters birthday& but they did not stick to the wall& doors etc. and still had to use bluetac or Sellotape & wouldn't use them again."
4781,1473,5," These are a great little invention& we purchased them for a balloon bursting game where the balloons were stuck to the wall& they all stayed put without any of the usual issues you would have with tape."
4782,1473,5," These really do work! I hung some balloons from a wooden beam for a party and they were still there 2 weeks later. Great product& I will be trying some of the others in the range next"
4783,1473,5," This is an ingenious product.  I have used them twice to hang balloons and party streamers perfectly. Clever& original and inventive& I wouldn't use anything else."
4784,1473,5," Ideal for not spoiling your freshly painted walls but wishing to display balloons to decorate and enhance the party spirit.  Good idea."
4785,1474,5," fantastic& thank you!"
4786,1475,5," :)"
4787,1476,5," Very pretty."
4788,1477,4," Little boy was very happy with the invitations& a great buy."
4789,1477,5," Excellent product!"
4790,1478,5," Nice candle. Colourfull on both sides. Looked lovely on my baby's birthday cake. The only comment to make this candle even better would be to make the bit which we stick into the cake slightly longer as where the icing was a bit soft the candle seemed to have lean to one side a little. Apart from that lovely."
4791,1478,5," I thought it would be a small candle. It's bigger than I expected. So it looks nicer on a cake. Both sides have multi-colors and glitters. It's easy to light and blow the candle. It stands firmly in the cake. Good quality and good value."
4792,1478,5," Excellent quality. Does what it's supposed to do"
4793,1478,5," Great value for money"
4794,1479,5," These cards are absolutely gorgeous! Really pleasantly surprised by the quality for  the price. Other review made me laugh& if 8 cards aren't enough buy more packs. You can't go wrong at Â£1.60! Would reccommend :-)"
4795,1479,5," Firstly& for some reason these thank you notes are being classed as a toy so I am unable to score them for their durability and educational value lol.Lovely baby shower thank you notes& bought these to match the plates etc we had for the shower. Good quality."
4796,1479,5," Lovely cards and great price. Took a whole to arrive though but I'm probably comparing them to amazons super quick delivery"
4797,1479,5," Excellent value and service& thank you!"
4798,1479,5," Very speedy purchase process with quick delivery.  These cards were extremely good value to encourage a little one to say 'Thank You' for their gifts."
4799,1479,5," This is my second order of these cards - I was so pleased with the first order that when I needed more I got the same again"
4800,1479,4," Beautiful and great quality cards! They have lots of detail inside aswell as out! I am going to buy more as I have ran out!"
4801,1479,5," These cards are great for thank you cards and you can write your own personalised message in them as they are blank."
4802,1480,5," Lovely cards and very good quality"
4803,1481,5," Nice invites for Paw Patrol fans"
4804,1481,5," My little one loved them."
4805,1482,5," I normally do my own invitations but opted for these as my son is a huge fan of spider man.  They arrived in the specified time.  The only issues I had was the envelopes didn't stick very well but the were just the job."
4806,1482,5," Got these for my son birthday& little bit pricey for 6 invites but my son likes them and that's the main thing"
4807,1482,4," Nice invitations but a bit pricey."
4808,1483,1," Would give it zero stars if that was an option! When it arrived I only received 8 invites and 10 envelopes& I emailed to inform them and asked for 2 extra invites to be sent to make up for the 10 that was advertised and that I paid for! They didn't even email me back or send me the two that were originally missing! This ment that two of my daughters friends didn't get a Gruffalo invite to her party!"
4809,1483,5," Fab& affordable little invites. I got lots of replies from parents saying their children loved these."
4810,1483,5," Quick delivery. Good quality product. Very happy."
4811,1483,5," Fab invites"
4812,1484,5," Great fun item. Really big candles and looked great on cake. Lovel to use with other kitty product. would order again."
4813,1485,5," Just delighted with these invitations.  Didn't expect them to be of such high quality for the price.Would recommend this company and need other products for my anniversary so will be using them againGreat communication and speedy deliveryThanl youMargaret Fagan"
4814,1485,5," These were just what I needed. For the price I thought they'd look cheap and not be that great. But they are great value for money and look really good. Would buy more again"
4815,1485,1," Product received was not as pictured - I wanted silver wedding anniversary party invitations (as pictured) - not wedding invitations! Disappointed."
4816,1485,5," Product just as described. Half the price as in local shops. Quality more than expected for the price paid.Just what I ordered."
4817,1485,5," Product as described. Good communication from seller."
4818,1485,5," Really nice invites.  Arrived early. Brilliant"
4819,1486,5," These are good invites and a lot better than others I have seen. My son loved writing these with me so would say worth every penny as colours are nice and bright?"
4820,1487,1," Basically& these party invitations do not follow the normal realm of logic. There is no place where to put the name of the person holding the party (only in the slip below). A normal card would say |XXXX is having a party|& this doesn't. Also& whoever has a reply slip in this day and age of mobile phones? Please don't buy it"
4821,1487,5," Really pleased with these invitations - nice and simple& and arrived very quickly. Good price too."
4822,1487,5," Bought these for my 3year old birthday party... He loves them! just one thing he didn't want to give them out lol... Even his friend where just more excited just seeing the invite! Great hit!! Bargain buy!!!"
4823,1487,5," The  Sam party invites were fab my fireman Sam mad son loved them and in sure his School friends will when they go out today every thing you need and great price too"
4824,1487,4," Great invites& the blue background makes it a little hard to see what you have written. I'd buy them again tho as the kids loved them and they were easy to fill in."
4825,1487,5," Did exactly what you expect a birthday party invite to do. Bright and colourful design. Came with envelopes and you get plenty in a pack for a reasonable price"
4826,1487,2," Couldn't find fireman Sam in the shops& so this is good if you need that& they are on cheap paper and only printed on one side. They do a job."
4827,1487,5," These invite had all the information i need to write my sons birthday invites out. Fantastic value for money best price i found :)"
4828,1488,4," The face looked a bit strange but with industrial promotion what can you do. Next time I would go to a shop and choose it myself. In any case makes the job."
4829,1488,5," Pretty candle& bright colours and instantly recognisable as Snow White by my princess mad daughter."
4830,1489,5," Really lovely cape. Very impressed with the quality and swift arrival. My boys looked fabulous in their capes for Halloween. Everybody commented on how fantastic they looked. Would recommend."
4831,1490,4," Very good fit. Had a lot of fun at a recent fancy dress party. Arrived in good condition and was fast."
4832,1491,4," Purchased for daughter as part of themed week at school. Whilst my 5 year old is tall for her age I would recommend parents get this costume in the next size up to what their child normal wears."
4833,1491,4," My nearly 9 year old daughter loves this. I ordered the girls large and the size comes up small I'd say but luckily she's very slim so it fits ok."
4834,1491,4," Bought this costume for my daughters pirate day at school. It's not a dress it a top and skirt with the belt to bring the two together. The material is soft nylon and had elasticated waist and top so will last a while!"
4835,1491,5," My daughter loved this outfit for a pirate themed day at school. She added her own touches to it& including a petticoat for  under the skirt as it was a little see through. She looked great."
4836,1491,5," Perfect costume for a girl pirate I ordered large for my 7 year old and fitted well& just needed to tie belt instead of using Velcro as a bit big but still looked fab."
4837,1491,5," Brilliant simplistic outfit which easily fits items under it in cooler weather. My daughter loved it. Arrived on time& packaged well. No problems. Totally recommended."
4838,1491,5," Brilliant price! Bought this for a themed event at my daughters school& good quality product for the price and my daughter now has it in her dressing up box"
4839,1491,5," ive search all over for a pirate outfit for my little girl she be over the moon when she opens it christmas day cheers"
4840,1492,5," Bought this for my daughter who is 11years old she loved it. She is average size for 11yr old. The xs I bought her was just a little bit big but didnt have to make any adjustments.  Very pleased with costume."
4841,1492,2," size to big. I wear 34 and xs was way too big"
4842,1492,5," Size not for adult."
4843,1493,5," Quick delivery and lovely product."
4844,1494,4," I bought this for my 4 year old daughter-she loves it.Good quality& perhaps a little pricy but I was happy with the quality.Slightly big on my 4 year old which is what I wanted...it will last her longer. Would fit an average 5-6 year old perfectly."
4845,1494,5," I purchased this nurses outfit for my 5 year old grand daughter. She loves it as it is comfortable for her to wear and I love it because it is of good quality and she looks adorable in it. It comes with the nurses cap and a little bag as well as a pretending watch on the dress."
4846,1494,5," Great quality childrens outfit - niece was extremely happy with it - bought her the medium and she had turned 4yrs old"
4847,1494,5," I wanted a more modern little nurses outfit for my four yr old granddaughter& It is excellent quality& made really well& she loves the little bag that comes with it too. overall I highly recommend. small is ideal for her she is 4."
4848,1494,5," Brilliant little outfit! Bought for my 3 year olds birthday! She couldn't wait to dress up and play with her new doctors set as a nurse! Outstanding value for money!"
4849,1494,4," It's good quality and very cute my daughter loves it!! Great dress up for teaching children about nurses and their roles"
4850,1494,5," My daughter has spent almost every other day 'dressing-up' in this super little nurse outfit.  Great quality& hours of endless fun!"
4851,1494,2," this out fit was for my granddaughter for a school event delivery was good but the quality of this outfit was very poor was to late to send back but would not reccomend"
4852,1495,3," The actual shirt is ok but the mask is terrible. Its shaped like an oval and looks like naan bread."
4853,1495,5," Bit tacky but good for the money."
4854,1496,5," First of I have to give SHOP4FANCYDRESS enormous credit for their delivery. Unbelievable service. I chose the free supersaver 7 day delivery but the item arrived less than 24hrs after ordering. I live in a different country from the company. Stunningly good& would recommend to everybody.As for the product& absolutely brilliant. The value is remarkable. For this price you usually get those animal costumes that are glorified onesies. This is a real mascot style costume with removable head. You even get that wee scarf. Perfect for xmas parties& dressing up your stag on his doo& fancy dress& football cup finals etc."
4855,1496,5," Honestly& this thing is AMAZING value at Â£25. It really does look like the photos! I've attached some of mine. It even survived a go in the washing machine after a 5km run in deep mud! WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR?!Oh& and a pro-tip: If you DO want to go running in it& a baseball cap firmly worn inside the head will support the big flappy mouth really well."
4856,1496,5," Was looking for a themed item and bought costume as a laugh for one-off work event. Worked a treat& excellent value..!"
4857,1496,5," This item is really good quality and also very good value for money& the head is huge but not heavy.  Arrived very quickly on ordinary mail."
4858,1496,5," Firstly& sorry for the poor quality of image but you can get the jist.I am 5ft 9 slim male (10.5st) and this suit fits perfectly. Perfect amount of bagginess around arms and feet!Everything arrived nicely packaged on the estimated delivery time!The quality of the suit is excellent for price paid& would highly recommend. The head is not at all heavy but visibility isn't the best and can be a little loose but apart from that& excellent!"
4859,1496,4," I haven't given this product 5 stars as the only problem with it is the face is front heavy! So it does slip forward if you intend to jump around in it. We just added some Velcro to the back of the neck and the back of the suit. We found this worked really well. The product was delivered when promised and I think the quality of the outfit is very good for the price."
4860,1496,5," Fancy dress Christmas party outfit that was actually surprisingly cheap for the whole suit. Totally reuseable and high quality. Head of costume is a little uncomfortable to wear all night so I took a separate pair of antlers that I popped on instead towards the end of the night."
4861,1496,4," Bought for a Christmas party but unfortunately not used due to illness....Looks like the picture but quite difficult to see from out of the head because the head is very heavy but will be good fun for next year!"
4862,1497,5," Great value for money & also if dropped I know it will not break"
4863,1497,5," Excellent product - great value"
4864,1497,5," Fab fun and light"
4865,1497,5," as described"
4866,1498,5," This item was for my grandsons' book day at school the theme was Julia Donaldson books. He became highway rat and he was delighted. The costume was a huge hit."
4867,1499,5," I bought this outfit for a fancy dress party and I was really impressed by the quality to the dress - heavy velvet& well cut and stitched.  I got many favourable comments.  It fitted well.  Was a little long for me (I'm 5' 3|) but I didn't want to cut it as there is gold braid round the bottom so I just let it trail a little - very mediaeval."
4868,1499,5," I wore this when I spent a few days in a castle where a medieval banquet was held.  I chose the Large size as I am a size 14-16 and hover between the two.  It fitted really well and there are ties at the back to take up the slack!  The material is better than I expected and as I had to  iron it before I wore it& was a bit anxious as to whether it  would stand up to it& but it did!  The headdress took a bit of sorting out but once I had worked it out how to put it on it was very effective and looked the part.  Great value for money. I received many compliments and I recommended it to many people at the banquet."
4869,1499,5," I had been looking at used costumes but was able to buy this costume new at a cheaper price than I could get the used costumes for. The headdress comes up a little small but looks good. I am usually a size 12-14 but went for the 16-18 and am glad I did as this size fits better on a larger chest. The back of the waist is elasticated and there is a tie on each side of the costume so it can be adjusted to make the fit tighter. The material is very nice and doesn't look cheap. Very pleased with the item and it looks like it should cost a lot more than it actually did."
4870,1499,5," A very authentic costume. Decent quality. Stretchey fabric so it is very comfortable. very flattering. Lovely rich colour. I am 5'5 tall and this was a good length with a flat shoe."
4871,1499,4," Lovely dress.  It is just like the picture.  I bought a size medium"
4872,1499,5," I was really impressed at how quickly this product arrived. The size was perfect ( some products come on the 'smaller size'& however as a size 18/20 the larger size had ample room. Great value for money"
4873,1499,3," It's ok for a silly dress up party& but would not be suitable for a more formal occasion& such as a medieval themed ball or banquet& for example. There seem to be some issues with length& according to other reviews& so to try and help explain: I am 5foot 6 and without shoes the dress touches the floor& exactly as on the model in the picture shown here. There isn't actually a pink underskirt& as the picture seems to imply - the pink material is simply a triangular panel that has been sown into the front. Similarly& the border across the hip does not actually go all around the dress& same with the border around the neckline - it does not continue around the back. This makes the dress pretty boring and unflattering to look at from behind& as it's basically just one huge sack of crushed velveteen material when looked at from the back. The finishing is ok& I had to cut off various threads that were still hanging off the seams& but nothing too drastic. The headpiece does fit me ok& but from experience when buying hats& my head does seem to be on the small side. However the bits of veil that are supposed to come down by the side of the face are smaller than in the picture shown& which makes them look quite silly. Plus& I think the model is actually wearing the headpiece incorrectly& as it contains more veil (not visible in the picture)  that I think goes around the neck and chin (Google 'Medieval Headdress' and you'll see what I mean.) It looks ok when this veil part is worn around the front of the neck& but it still doesn't change the fact that the bits on the side of the face are too short."
4874,1499,4," The dress is beautifus and it looks great on. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because the thing that goes on your head is too small!! Couple of friends and I tried it on and it doesn't fit neither of us!A shame as I will have to find one."
4875,1500,5," Great fun for fancy dress fit well"
4876,1501,4," I initially bought one of these for my eldest daughter about 3 years ago. A tad on the flimsy side but for the price I couldn't complain.My youngest daughter took it on as a 'dressing up outfit' after my eldest had used it for school& and had hours of fun with it.After she had played with it until the end of its life it eventually had to be thrown away& but when it came to her turn to be an evacuee& no other outfit would do!We came straight back here and purchased another.Like I said& for the price I was more then happy with it. Not the most robust outfit ever made& but you get what you paid for and it served its purpose very well ðŸ˜Š"
4877,1501,4," Good product for girls dressing upChild liked to wear this on school trip and another wear at school afterwards."
4878,1501,4," Lovely dress and just right for my daughter's school event. Only niggle was had to undo the bow as was digging in her tummy& but easily done. Biggest complaint is with Amazon lack of customer service over delivery& but nothing to do with dress itself"
4879,1501,3," this was bought for my friends daughter for a school project and she loves it. she certainly looked the part of an evacuee."
4880,1501,4," very cheap but mine has got two brown splodges on the back which can be seen as they are bigger than my thumb print! also faded mark in the print along the waist line. Going to have to go and buy a huge thicker length of ribbon to cover the waistband area and cant do anything about the splodges! I assume I have a faulty one as they are clearly ink splodges from the brown print in the fabric."
4881,1501,5," Good quality and sizing perfect for school themed days? Much easier for me to buy than make and can be added to with suitable accessorires."
4882,1501,5," very pleased with my purchase& and it arrived on the day it was to be delivered i would use this person again  my grand daughter loved it as it was for ww1 dress up at school ."
4883,1501,5," Great little dress. Ordered it for my daughters assembly. She still parades around the house in it now.  Great fit and great price."
4884,1502,3," Overall the build quality and price are so extremely off that it is almost ridiculous. It's extremely thin& and doesn't feel very comfortable. Yet it does look great. It fulfilled what I was trying to obtain. Look like a pirate.So overall 4/5 for look and 2.5/5 for price."
4885,1502,5," fitsperfectly"
4886,1503,5," I wore this for a Star Trek birthday party last night and felt pretty awesome in it. The skirt is VERY short& if you bend over everyone can see your unmentionables :)But& as others have posted& the material is thick and good quality. It was rumpled after packing but the pleats in the skirt iron up beautifully.I would agree with the person who said it was a size 14. I am a 10-12 and it was pretty big on me. But it was surprisingly flattering and hid my belly nicely. I wore a loose belt over it and hung my communicator and phaser on it :)"
4887,1503,3," I purchased two of these costumes& one for myself and one for my sister& as we were attending a Star Trek convention. I was very disappointed as 'one size fits all' came up very large and too big for both myself and my sister. However& if you roughly a size 14 this is the perfect costume. The quality of the dress was as expected& thick enough but you should not intend for this dress to last. For the price& I think that this is a suitable costume but does not fulfil a wide range of consumer's needs."
4888,1503,5," This dress was supprisingly good value for money& the material is thick and the dress is well made. the iron on badge did peel off relitivley easily and was replaced with a badge perfect for fancy dress!"
4889,1503,5," this product is really good value for money.  The material is quite thick and good quality.  I'm really impressed."
4890,1503,4," The dress is very good material for the price. Says fits 10-14. I'm a 10 and it is a good fit on me. I had to remove the badge and replace it with a proper Star Trek one but that wasn't a hassle. Definitely worth the price for a cheap fancy dress outfit."
4891,1503,5," Comfortable& nice length (I'm 5' 5|& and size 8-10). Wore it with a narrow belt and it was terrific. Great colour and fabric was better than I expected given the price. Very pleased with it!"
4892,1503,4," Good value product.  Bought for specific fancy dress occasion - not for serious Trekie fans as not replica but great for a bit of fun."
4893,1504,4," Looked good on my son& quality good.  Arrived on time and packaged well."
4894,1504,5," Excellent item. Was impressed"
4895,1505,5," This costume is very well made and good value for money. The fabric is sewn together well and a nice fit - clothes such as leggins and t-shirt can be worn beneath without spoiling appearance. The costume is ideal for 'World Book Day' and does not reveal too mush flesh. A little creased upon arrival - but these soon dropped out once hung on a hanger .Under skirt on a hoo gives dress good shape and comfortable to wear. Overall would reccommend this garment for all the above reasons."
4896,1505,5," Sizing was very good always worry with the costumes as they r normally to small or big& but sizing was very good. quality is very good and much better than expected. wife said it come with a hoop that goes in the skirt to puff it out."
4897,1505,5," Quick delivery. Costume fits well. Ordered large and I'm typically 16/18. Nice fabric/quality. Nice if your not after skinny/skimpy costume!"
4898,1505,4," This item was perfect for my office party.  The only problem I had was it was too long and I needed the have it turned up.  Other than that it was fine.  I had a lot of compliments about it."
4899,1505,5," Queen of heart  outfit.Excellent product well worth money very delighted with good service well presented I am a very happy customer."
4900,1505,5," Fantastic dress!  Ordered a small.  I'm a size 10-12 top and 34B and it fits perfectly. Elastic is a little tight at the waist but manageable for a costume.  If you are under 5' 6| I imagine you may find it a little bit long.  The red neck piece doesn't stand up easily on its own& but overall I'm very pleased with it :)"
4901,1505,5," am size 14 about 5' 6/7 this fits well but a little long& looks good (well I think so) As I read in another review& I was aware collar not capable of staying up on own so I will reinforce it for the party (florist wire perhaps) for best effect"
4902,1505,5," I felt like a queen for the day&  wearing this to work for children's fancy dress party.  Lots if compliments received.  Perfect fit and length (size 18. And 5'8| height).  Definately recommended and a great price!!"
4903,1506,4," If you're expecting high quality gloves these are probably not the product for you.  I needed them for a fancy dress night out and they were great for the price! They fit well& stayed up and didn't fall apart. Overall I'd say a decent find!"
4904,1506,2," The gloves came promtly. But my main problem is that they were way to big. I'm not a small person (168cm) ad would say I have average sized hands and they diet fit at all. I'm afraid they didn't get worn"
4905,1506,4," Not too bad for the price. Of course they are not going to be perfect for the price and the stitching is way off but it got me through halloween."
4906,1506,3," We're great for my cruella devile costume. Marked down as the gloves laddered the 1st time I tried them on but they did the job"
4907,1506,5," I order these on Sunday night and they arrived by Tuesday very happy with the product good for fancy dress"
4908,1506,5," My daughter was very impressed&when they arrived&as they went perfectly well with her dress."
4909,1506,5," Still waiting on red stripe scarf& apart from that& all items were good."
4910,1506,5," Very good.  Larger size& fitted my husbands hand easily for halloween."
4911,1507,5," great one happy daughter"
4912,1508,5," OK it's a bit |chinzy| with regards to the material used.  Some kind of polyester& reminiscent of bad pretend silk& BUT the cut and overall effect of the costume really works.  The detail of the attached waist coat& chains and sleeves& topped off with a very generous cape is as good as it will get with regards to a manufactured mass produced costume.  And after all it's Halloween& it's the effect we were after& this costume is certainly one of the better ones without spending a fortune.  I ordered a size Medium for my husband (40-42)& he is a 38 chest& and this fitted just right& in his words |wouldn't want it any smaller|.  The arms are a bit short& but not noticeably.The reason I give this product 5 stars are for the fact that I ordered at 7:30AM on Tuesday& it was despatched the same day& and delivered (FREE of charge) Thursday morning 9:30AM.  The price from this seller was competitive and I only found one other on-line retailer selling for less& but adding the standard (3-4 day delivery) it was the same price.  Thinking about hiring or searching stores for the same product would have cost a lot more in time and money.  And to be honest while the material is chinzy& I think in comparison to other costumes out there it is rather good quality.Note however it is not washable or dry cleanable.  Sponge clean only.  Also does NOT come with trousers or cane.  But my husband is happy to wear his own black trousers& rather than an ill-fitting pair.I would highly recommend this costume if you are going to that fancy dress party and want to take the hassle out of choosing between the selection of dracula outfits online& because you won't go wrong with this.  As I say& I really don't think cost wise and the effect this costume gives can be matched.  So all in all a good buy."
4913,1508,3," So my costume arrived on time as usual. I can never complain about delivery from Amazon.Quality wise& it is fine. Perhaps not really worth the Â£30 or so it costs but it is OK. I noticed a few loose strands of cotton around the buttons that had to be trimmed off. But it does look better than most of the cheaper outfits you will find in certain supermarkets.Sizing is small. I ordered large& I'm 6ft and slim build so fit between medium and large depending on brands with normal clothes. This thing feels short& sleeves are short& it doesn't reach my waist so I will have to wear a black t - shirt underneath.I would suggest anyone who is taller than 5ft 8 needs to buy XL."
4914,1508,4," What came was great... The cloak was very good quality and exceeded my expectation considering the price... I also liked the top... The costume generally is very good quality not tackie or cheap looking. The one down side (hence the lack of fifth star) was it doesn't come with trousers which is an addition piece to costume to get later... I recommend a cheap pair of suit trousers to go with this costume... Over very happy with costume and will certainly be looking at similar items from this business in the future"
4915,1508,5," Excellent price/quality. It has a nice weight to it& and will certainly be wearable a few more times! Pick a big enough size to get a big swirling cape& the waistcoat can easily be tightened up."
4916,1508,4," Although the chains came free at the end of the night& it lasted as long as I had hoped it would and had a great Halloween!  I would still order again!"
4917,1508,3," Great outfit but to small even though I ordered medium I feels like it's xtra small."
4918,1508,5," Stunning fancy dress outfit& well worth pay a bit more you get what you pay for"
4919,1508,3," Hubby a 44chest n it just fit also a bit short in the top aswell"
4920,1509,3," I bought this shirt for a fancy-dressed theme staff Christmas party& having looked for several weeks online and locally for something similar.  Whilst (at 44|) it just about fitted around the chest area& its velcro fastenings popped open every time I took a deep breath& and I would have had to have wrists like twigs to adequately fasten the sleeves.  Because of the minimal time before the function& I was obliged to go along with it& but had to invest in getting press stud fastenings in place of the velcro to preserve some modesty."
4921,1509,4," bought it for a sixties night and I think i will look like a million dollars or a bit of a pansy"
4922,1509,4," Bought for a fancy dress party and it was just the job and surprisingly well made.  Have washed it and ironed it since and it will live to see many more parties if the need arises.  Great value too."
4923,1509,2," Looks very cheaply made with lots of threads hanging from the seams which I had to cut off. The sewing looks very fragile and I donâ€™t expect this shirt to last for more than one wash. It arrived very creased and I wanted to wash it and iron it but decided against it. I should have just bought a fancy â€œruffâ€ and fixed it to an ordinary white shirt to create the same effect."
4924,1509,5," It does what it says on the tin& good quality for the price and it allows my dad to go as an ageing disco king to a 70s fancy dress!"
4925,1509,5," Pink shirt was perfect for a 70s night fancy dress! Worked really well with rest of outfit....very funny! Def recommend it"
4926,1509,4," I really like this shirt"
4927,1509,5," Arrived on time and mostly in good order& a few frayed edges but what can be expected for the price"
4928,1510,4," This product is so cheap and good quality. It's brilliant for a themed party which is what I used it for and it was good fun. It came on time as well."
4929,1510,3," The strings break through the flimsy coconut bit quite easily however for the price it is fine for a fancy dress party"
4930,1510,3," Coconut braNot as sturdy as I expected& too flimsy had to wear a t shirt under it& thanks anyway"
4931,1510,4," Perfect for one night fancy dress...although coconuts are quite small so bear in mind!"
4932,1510,2," Bought for a dress up do and the neck string didn't fit round my neck it was extremely short maybe could have adapte sit but wouldn't of looked good!"
4933,1510,3," Bought for props...it's fun to have. You will need to wear something underneath!"
4934,1510,4," String broke too easily but was good quality other than that and arrived quickly"
4935,1510,4," Not great quality but cheap and good for a laugh!"
4936,1511,5," very effective costume.  a little make up on the face and what a difference. costume came on time very quickly and we were very pleased overall"
4937,1511,5," Fast delivery&brilliant costume&will  buy again."
4938,1511,5," Very cool and complete& just add shoes"
4939,1511,5," Amazing costume!"
4940,1512,5," A lovely Mrs Clause outfit that comes with the dress and apron and a hat. More traditional than the usual outfits you sometimes see. I ordered this for an event and was worried it wouldnt come in time so I contacted the seller before dispatch to check. They quickly replied with a note to say they upgraded the postage free of charge and it came in plenty of time! Very good customer service"
4941,1512,3," The sizing is a bit off & I would go a size bigger & plus the apron string is way to short for tieing up at the back & I had to have it stitched together & apart from that it's ok for the job"
4942,1512,5," My wife wanted a Christmas outfit that wasn't one of the usual saucy ones. This fits the bill exactly - it looks very traditional and fits her size 14 frame well."
4943,1512,5," Well made and very good fit."
4944,1513,4," I chose this outfit for a friends 50th birthday party (theme was 'GOLD'). Caused a  real laugh. One thing to be aware of is that with the hood up you can hardly see much beyond what is directly in front of you& But if your dancing in one spot the effect is hilarious(hence the 4-star rating). I didn't think myself an extra large& but take into consideration these outfits are tight and so maybe go for the next size up. Because I didn't my outfit was vert tight and halfway through teh night the zip burst& (my partner had the x-large and had no problems) . Also it's not called second skin for nothing every lump and bump is on show& i'd recommend investing in a cricket box to keep some things a mystery.The seller delivered the product swiftly and packed well. for that I'd give 5 stars."

4946,1513,5," Aside from feeling a little exposed as the only girl out in the full suit it was comfortable and great for the event. I would strongly recommend if you are able to zip yourself when drunk or have friends who will help. (it's possible to do on your own if your shoulders are reasonably flexible)"
4947,1513,5," This item arrived pretty fast& I'm chuffed to bit with it& really good quality."
4948,1513,5," Really happy with the outfit"
4949,1514,5," great costume even though the chains on the bat wings are poor and snapped straight away& but we sorted that&&&still pleased with the design& style and material&&&looks quality when on. friends have asked can they wear it when they go to future fancy dress parties& always a good sign."
4950,1514,3," This costume looks very nice& but the quality of his is poor. Since the news came out whalebone and rear belt loop clothing was ragged& and another 4 broke away during the party"
4951,1515,5," great fun item for fancy dress&this necklace is made of gold coloured plastic with a gold string like chain which is a good length and can be looped over the head to make a choker and necklace combined.It can also be tied at the back loosely to shorten it.A good fun item and not to be taken seriously as a real piece of jewellery."
4952,1515,5," bit plastic but did the job& generally happy with the service and the product did the job! would recommend thanks"
4953,1515,1," Rubbish ! Don't bother - quality worth about 10p"
4954,1515,5," Tacky but great for the fancy dress party"
4955,1516,5," Got this for a couple of quid and it was well worth it& great costume but dont pay a fortune for it"
4956,1517,3," Dress is ok and put a smile on our granddaughters face& but the dress is poorly made& skirt very uneven along the hem and fitting is large in some areas and small in others. Would not recommend to anyone."
4957,1517,5," was worried it would not arrive in time for Halloween but got here with 2 and half week spare. Fits well and looks like the picture& very happy with my purchase"
4958,1517,3," Product is overpriced given the poor quality& lots stray threads which required hem to be sewn.However& it arrived when stated and packaged well."
4959,1517,5," My 11 year old daughter is delighted. Arrived on time and is great quality."
4960,1518,4," Bought this for a hen party& the sizing is good and the quality of the items are pretty good for what it is. The straw hat is fab and sets off the outfit brilliantly. No real drawbacks& the only surprise was the shirt which is actually really short in the body just below the bra line& this is hidden by the dress so doesn't matter you just can't tell from the photo."
4961,1518,5," This product is fab....much better than what I was expecting.  It is good quality and looks fab on.  Dress has buttons down the back for easy fastening& fits well (Im between a 10"
4962,1518,5," I have to recommend this product! I was a bit skeptical because you never know how these costumes will fit but this one is great.  I am easily a size 12 and it fits perfectly.  It doesnâ€™t feel cheap either.  The material is very forgiving!  Overall I love this product and will confidently wear it!"
4963,1518,1," Fair enough for a girl to be a bit slutty on Halloween but this is like a full blown prostitue. The tie was dirty and the socks were laddered. It was like it was second hand. I had high hopes because of the majority of good reviews but I was not impressed at all& sending it back."
4964,1519,5," Perfect little joke stocking filler& I'm not sure that the people I brought them for have used them but they looked fine in the packets."
4965,1520,5," A little noisy...but it honestly doesn't matter. It's so funny watching people's reactions that it's worth every penny. You don't look to buy something like this unless you're willing to make a fool of yourself. THE PERFECT OUTFIT!!!"
4966,1520,5," Great product& nightmare to get to the bar in though...."
4967,1520,5," Fantastic"
4968,1521,4," Good value&I will enjoy having a laugh with this"
4969,1522,4," Quality was better than expected especially as it was priced around Â£8 at the time! Like the material and very comfortable! Not convinced it would fit a size 14 though as relatively small would say more size 10-12."
4970,1522,5," Couldn't fault this outfit. I was amazed at the quality of it for the price and it fitted and looked good on.It lasted the night too& it didn't come appart.Not sure whether it would wash& but for the price& does it matter!"
4971,1523,4," Does what it says on the tin. large costume& fits easily and looks the part.  Good price as well.  Key for me as I wore it at a footy match where booze was consumed& is that the whole costume did not have to come off when one wanted to use the WC."
4972,1523,4," Great product. Rather large but most people had already said that. Fitted the purpose of the occassion and was delivered promptly. Very happy"
4973,1523,5," I found that this costume worked a treat at the party I went to& I pulled out all the usual banana jokes and it got a lot of positive attention& people really liked the banana costume. The only bad thing is that you dont get the black lycra suit worn in the picture& but not to worry a black t-shirt and pair of black jeans work perfectly.Its definitely one of my 5 a day."
4974,1523,5," I cannot tell you what possesed me to buy the suit because i don't know myself. When the package came i must say i was a little dissapointed with the type of material it was made of& but when i put it on it was love at first wear. the hood stays up very well and it is comfortable. The product has its advantages to the tall and the short& for the tall the face hole will fit well on your head (around 6ft)& Otherwise the hole will cover your eyes unless you hold your arms in the air. The advantage for the short is that there is a little flap in the black bottom of the suit that when sitting down you can fit your legs into making the material tought and the suit look as realistic as possible. I love wearing the suit around the house and to the shops& I tend to put my entire head through the face hole wearing the top as a hole.In short this product is AMAZING"
4975,1523,4," A very fun and silly costume!  Got a very good response and lots of laughs at the party - I would recommend it if you are considering going a little bit whacky!"
4976,1523,4," I was planning to dress up as the 'peanut butter jelly time' banana. It arrived on the earliest delivery time estimate (in time for Halloween!.)And fits me quite well (I'm 6 foot). The only problem is that its not as bannana-shaped as i hoped- i mean when its worn it goes flat as its made out of a soft material& although this makes it very comfortable to wear aswel!The price has been jacked up since i bought it last week (it was Â£12)- so i would go and look somewhere else too (or but it well before halloween)!"
4977,1523,2," I ordered this banana costume to have a laugh at a Halloween party& I have not yet been but the costume has arrived& the top and the bottom of the banana do not stick out as shown in the picture& and it is made of thin& cheap material. Even though I am 5|11 male this item is still to big& so if you don't want much for your money and you're above six foot& this is what you need. overall very displeased"
4978,1523,3," great costume however it was massive.  not really a problem& the only annoying thing was that the costume kept on sliding down and my face would slip out of the face hole and i wouldn't be able to see anything.  other than that its a great costume to have at a fancy dress party."
4979,1524,3," This was very quickly delivered - and is accuate fit for size 10-12.  It is however& very very long so I will need to find a  sewing kit before our fancy dress day."
4980,1524,5," This dress arrived prior to expected.  It fitted perfectly and the length was just right.  I am tall and the dress touches the floor which looked very regal.  The material is a good quality for the price and it looks perfect on.  Can't wait to wear it. I would certainly buy from this seller again"
4981,1524,5," Was just right for what I wanted& 5 minutes on catwalk seen from a distance in hairdressing competition. Price reflects quality& headdress bit 'twee' needed to get 'real' crown. Stiffening in puffs at top of sleeve to keep shape& I added knee length chiffon split over-sleeves for more authenticity and used braid from headdress to hide the join. Quite thin black 'velvet' fabric. 'Brocade' is more pinky red than bright red& a silky plain fabric with all over pattern of tiny silver dots. Snug fit on 39| bust. The back length of garment is about 62|& turned up front for model's height and left back to trail. Organizers said model looked good on catwalk."
4982,1524,5," Really good value for many ......looked really good ....dressed up with a crown it was ideal for our medieval banquet"
4983,1524,5," This costume is for me to play Viola in a Twelfth Night Party and it looks fabulous and fits well."
4984,1524,4," Good for price I added a voile train to back of dress and headress& used 3 Mtrs voile cost Â£6.00 so felt it made it a bit different in case anyone else at the Medieval night had bought the same dress & very good fit I am size 10 and bought a small& it is made of stretchy fabric."
4985,1524,4," The panel is very pink and the dress is very long. I am 5ft 8inches and it is far too long for me. The upper sleeve is too tight so I opened up the seam a couple of inches. After alterations the dress will fit as I will wear it on Christmas day. The headdress is awful."
4986,1524,5," Excellent fit and good quality for the price. Looks the part!As stated in other reviews& it was too long& but needle"
4987,1525,5," I think the most important thing about this product is that it doesnt look like cheap tat& as they so often do. Looks incredibly cute on & even nicer than in the picture shown. Not sure how well it will survive in the wash."
4988,1525,5," Bought for staff Christmas party at children's nursery. Loved this outfit as most outfits I looked at we're very revealing& not suitable for my work place. This outfit fitted me (size 12) fine as the belt pulled it all in."
4989,1525,3," it was ok it lasted for what i needed. one thing i would say not great material i pulled it down on the first day of use and it ripped a huge hole in the back. but the design is great and comfortable to wear."
4990,1526,5," A++++++++.Great quality and speedy delivery but item was too big for me unfortunately. I Was able to return and get a refund the item.Communication from seller was top class would definitely buy from seller again. I would definitely recommend."
4991,1526,1," My own fault& because i hadnt checked the outfit as soon as it came. Took it out of the package on the day of preformance and found a whopping hole ( which looked liked someone had try to iron and burnt it ) My daughter had to wear it like that as had no time to look for an alternative or mend."
4992,1526,5," arrived next day as promised& grt quality and value for money I'm very pleased with this fancy dress and shall purchase from this supplier again in the future"
4993,1526,5," Needed costumes for our nativity at the church& which had adults and kids in it.  This costume was perfect for our adult Mary x"
4994,1526,5," Brilliant& ordered for a fancy dress party and came very quickly. Exactly as described."
4995,1526,5," Costume came quickly and is exactly how it looks in the picture. Very pleased."
4996,1527,5," Great costume thank you"
4997,1528,5," i bought this power ranger costume for my grandson who is nearly 4 & it was a good fit it was a good quality material / it came with a mask he loved it and i would recomend this product ."
4998,1528,5," We've bought the costume for our 3y7m son. He love it and wants to wear it all the time. The quality is good it's sewn  very well and fit fit perfect. The mask is also ok. So seeing him so happy I would definitely recommend it to others."
4999,1528,5," well worth the money.  my grandson will be very pleased with santa when he gets this present.  A real quality item."
5000,1528,5," This is the first time I've ordered a product on Amazon. I live in New Zealand"
5001,1528,4," My twin boys loved Thease outfits& thev've worn and worn them in role play& standing up to tough use& Thease weren't the muscle chest outfits& just to clarify that for other buyers& watch out for this decrepency on websites& as price should be cheaper on non- muscle chest outfits& zoom in on photos&  make sure your not paying for the more expensive muscle chest outfits that can sell for Â£30 or more& non muscle outfits& expect to pay around Â£12 toÂ£18 on children's outfits&"
5002,1528,4," We bought this to send to Australia and AJ is so happy to have it. The series is currently being shown in Aus and the imaginative play is blasting ahead.It looks durable and I think it will last the high kicks and rolls pretty well!"
5003,1528,5," Little lad loved it so its 5 star for me && however dont think it will last him long as hes growing like mad outfit was a 5/6 n little lad not 5 yet n it just fits him right& mask is a bit big so he wont wear it."
5004,1528,1," Just unpacked it and lots of the white paint on the mask is coming away. Truly awful& do not buy."
5005,1529,4," Arrived on time which is great. The dress is very bright& not too short like some of the others on here& the sleeves are far too long for me"
5006,1529,5," Great fit lovely material. I'm 5'10| tall and this was a perfect length for me came to about where it does on the lady in the pic. Arrived quite quickly too"
5007,1529,5," Looked"
5008,1530,5," Firstly& I was thoroughly happy that this costume arrived weeks before Halloween (and about 4 days before I expected it to). This costume is made with a lovely& non-irritable material and was a perfect size! The stockings and gloves are also lovely.(If it helps customers I'm 5 ft 4 and a size 14. The size 12-14 costume fit perfectly& something you don't tend to find these days with costumes or clothes)"
5009,1530,4," It arrived on time. The material isn't top notch but it is good. The skirt is rather short so I would suggest getting a small black pettiskirt to go under it like I did. Also the tights are not as good as they are in the picture and are VERY white& I will also be buying new tights for this costume. All in all it is still one of the best costumes I have bought."
5010,1530,5," So please with this outfit. Good quality and excellent fit. I have a curvy shape and it just flattered it so well. Looked dearer than I paid. Only thing was it was quite short and I am 5ft 4| so not really tall and it was short on me! But I wore tights so didn't effect me too much."
5011,1530,5," My daughter got this for party fitted great orders 12-14 as that's her size and she said it even slimmed her down very fast delivery exactly what was wanted and ordered I highly recommend this seller"
5012,1530,1," Was not happy with it the sewing was done wrong so I my half fitted ."
5013,1531,5," Good quality& my niece loved it."
5014,1532,5," Excellent quality fitted great . Very please with purchase"
5015,1532,5," very pleased and fitted well. Quick service"
5016,1533,5," Good costume for the price."
5017,1534,4," my sister who I ordered this for really loves the cute cat cosplay& her only complaint was the cat ears which are on a metal hair clip which hurts her head after a while of wearing them."
5018,1534,4," Generally very happy& the gloves and tail are fab! I love the fact that the wire in the tail means it can be bent into whatever shape you like& and it's really long! Only give 4 star cos the bowtie is off centred so looks odd& and the bare metal hairband hurt my little girl too much to wear (in fact she nearly took her eye out!) however the actual 'ears' are lovely so I'm going to stitch them onto a fabric coated plastic hairband. Quite happy tho& and apart from the hairband incident& my little girl loves the set."
5019,1534,4," This product came a few days early whichmis always very nice& it is a good product for the price just bewear that the glows are better suited for small hands. The reason im only giving 4 stars is because on arrivie the pink ribbon on the bows were already torn and unfixable which is rather disapointing."
5020,1534,3," The paws were not the same as the ones shown in the photo. They were all black with big claws. Did not arrive in time for the event my daughter wanted to wear it for& but she loves the ears& tail and bow tie."
5021,1534,3," There are really cute& but the ear shape dosent stay as well as I'd like. The ribbens also fray after a wile so I had to cut them off. But overall there not bad."
5022,1534,3," This product is good& however& when I received this product& there were no cat paws and the bell had fallen off of one of the ears."
5023,1534,5," I really enjoyed this. It's extremely soft and a great costume for someone addicted to cats."
5024,1535,4," If you're like me then you'll also love getting all dressed up as a nun.When it comes to role-playing& I doubt there could be anything better.Swanning about with me wimple& eschewing earthly pleasures and vices& getting all cloistered up in some cloister somewhere and getting stuck into a passage or two of the bible.Phwoar. I bloody Love it.Now and then me and Big Mike (off the Littlehampton Lobbers darts team) will get dressed up together and we'll take a promenade around the Lower Browning Municipal Recreation Ground& talking about the enduring love of Christ and God's presence in all the wondrous aspects of nature.If I'm honest it took me quite a while getting in touch with my inner nun.I think that the stories you hear as a child - how nuns are filth and are always up to all manner of salacious adventures - tends to skew your idea of the glorious sisterhood.As an adult though& I have learnt that a number of these stories were just idle gossip and in one or two cases& downright lies.For instance& after reading the late great Thomas Watkin's |The Art of Promoting the Growth of the Cucumber and Melon: In a Series of Directions for the Best Means to Be Adopted in Bringing Them to a Complete State of Perfection (1824)| (A very good book - if& despite its title& a little on the short side) I found out that cucumbers actually grow downwards.So there would have been no real reason for Sister Nancy to have been thrown out of that nunnery for taking her early evening exercises in the vegetable patch.People's attitudes towards nuns need to change and I urge you to get yourself one of these outfits and to reach out to your inner nun.Its the best place to start."
5025,1536,5," Wonderful outfit my son loved it for his fancy dress party at nursery very happy with the product"
5026,1536,3," Looks cute& but the fur is falling everywhere& so this costume is just one wear."
5027,1536,4," Cute costume &but not so good quality"
5028,1537,5," Amazing quality and features. Really thrilled with it. What an incredible price for all the work."
5029,1538,5," This arrived exactly when it was meant to& and I was really impressed by the quality& some of these dressing up outfits that have the netting can be a bit scratchy on the inside& but there was no complaints from my three year old& she absolutely loves it& brilliant dress& highly recommend this item."
5030,1538,5," This dress is absolutely beautiful and extremely good quality.  The wings are detachable so it can be worn as a party dress.  I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived and would highly recommend it."
5031,1538,5," Ummed and arrhhed about the price versus other costumes - so glad I did it - beautifully made and worth every penny. Good quality& unique and even has sparkle on it. Highly recommend this."
5032,1538,5," This has got to be one of the finest dressing-up dresses I've ever bought. Beautiful colours& every layer finished off perfectly and extremely reasonably priced. Highly recommended"
5033,1539,5," Funny think for my fried birthday party .she love it"
5034,1540,4," Nicely made cloak. I was hunting around for a good one& so I tried this one I would recommend this cloak& suited my need and fits well."
5035,1540,5," Cloak is exactly as described. I've always wanted a cape/cloak and decided ||what the hang& do it|. Stoked!"
5036,1540,5," Lovely cloak& I have worn it outside normally not just for roleplay as its so cosy to wear."
5037,1541,4," The suit came pretty quickly in brand new packet& so all good on that side. Size is 2-4 but my son is an average-sized 3yr old and it just about fits him& however it is fairly stretchy. Material itself seems quite hardy& my son likes hopping around with it on and its held up so far!! He complains that the velcro on the hood under the chin sometimes chokes him so he leaves it undone& so not really a problem. pretty good for price."
5038,1541,5," Great item and a great fit for my 2 yr old and has plenty of growing room left in it."
5039,1541,5," A very cute little outfit& at a good price& plus it's a bit different from the usual toddler fancy costumes you see on the high street. My son has worn it quite a bit and loves it"
5040,1541,5," My grandsons (twin boys) love their dressing up suits. Frog for one boy"
5041,1541,4," Not the best fancy dress outfit I have ever seen but my 3 yr old loves it and It's pretty cheap so don't think you could expect any better.  It fits him perfectly too."
5042,1541,5," Lovely little costume& my boy loves it and for the money i dont think you could expect more. I'd say it comes up a tad small."
5043,1541,4," This costume is very funny and nice. It is very well made. The only complaint is about the fabric. It is 100% polyester."
5044,1541,4," Great for occassional use my son loved wearing it but.cannot put it on himself as I fear the material may give way."
5045,1542,5," My wife has had a very hard time following the death of her father and having to look after other members of the family and I regually called her a wonder woman.  One day she said |Well& where is my cosutme then.|  As a person who has had to shop in Evans for larger size clothes in the past (although she is losing weight and look good on it) I didn't think even if I could find a costume it would be any good.  Seeing this outfit advertised I thought I would buy it if only to give her a laugh.  When it arrived I was disappointed at its condition.  Although it was new& it had obviously been taken out of its original packing and stuffed back in.  The costume was creased and not well presented.  I would not have accepted it in this condition had I seen it in a shop but it was not so bad that I felt it should be returned.  When I gave it to her I got the laugh I wanted.  When she tried it on& however I got the thrill this costume should evoke.  It was far better made than some of the dressing up outfits and even the boots fitted.  My only complaint is that the zip at the back doesn't stay up (Maybe it was designed to fall open!)  It is a costume that could be worn out to a party and not just to stay on for a few minuets in the bedroom.  It even made her feel better."
5046,1542,3," The overall look of this outfit is brilliant! However& there are a number of issues that let it down. Firstly& although it states 16-20 I would say it's more like 18-20. I am a 16 but I have large boobs so it should have fit. I ended up taking it in about 4 inches as there was an excess of material on the back and it did not look pretty! Also the overboots that came with it were huge! So big they would have gone round my legs twice! Thirdly& Wonder woman didn't have a cape so this was surplus to requirement. Lastly& the armbands were twice as long as it needed to be."
5047,1542,4," Costume ordered as size 18... 14-16 came& however its a perfect fit.. Only small thing is boot toppers could doWith being elasticated  as they wont stay up.."
5048,1542,5," Loved this! After the reviews& I was worried that the sizing was going to be off and that the product wasn't going to be great. However& it fit me perfectly and the quality of the outfit was great - definitely one that is going to last and be pulled out again and again! Definitely recommend for any superhero events where you need a costume!"
5049,1542,5," Fast transaction& but item never arrived. Quickly resolved with a no quibble full refund.The one I rented instead was exactly the same outfit as the one described& it was of high quality and easy to wear. Would recommend this outfit as it looked amazing on."
5050,1542,5," Really good costume& Boot cover are how ever rubbish& had to buy red boots to finish the outfit off. Defo need to either not include bot covers or get better ones that actually fit shoes!"
5051,1542,5," This was delivered very quickly  and product looks good. Very pleased - good price also -very please - thank you(size a bit on the large size- Im a 10/12 and came in big in a small)"
5052,1542,5," I ordered this at the last minute for my daughter for a halloween party at school.  It not only arrived on time but was very good quality and fitted perfectly.  Very pleased."
5053,1543,3," Came up small so was glad I ordered the bigger size for my daughter.  Wore the dress only once and the material has snagged all around the skirt so will unlikely be able to wear again."
5054,1543,5," bought this for my niece for christmas the best thing ever she saidvery pleased with the company and the product"
5055,1543,3," When the outfit arrived i thought it was really nice..but my daughter wore it for her Alice in wonderland birthday party and the stitching round the neck came away leaving it looking raggy n frayed so she will not be able to use this again and she was quite upset ðŸ˜ž"
5056,1543,5," Our granddaughter wants to put this on as soon as she arrives at our house. We would have bought a larger size had we known it was going to be so popular."
5057,1543,5," I bought this for my grandaughters school disney day and she loved it and so did everyone else who saw it and it was fast dilivery and good discription"
5058,1543,5," Bought the dress in 5-6 years for my 3 year old after reading previous reviews and  am glad I did& it fits her perfectly and she loves wearing it"
5059,1544,5," i brought this for a friend and she loved and she looked good in it to &love wear it to partys"
5060,1545,3," It arrived on time to a pick-up location. I ordered XS size (6-8 UK)& but it is quite big for me! Actually my size is 8. So& be careful choosing the size& the costume is really bigger than you think!"
5061,1545,5," Fantastic fits a treat I'm  a size 8 and they come up generous"
5062,1546,4," Would like it to have come with a cross& but you cannot have everything!  Love the costume x"
5063,1547,5," It fell apart within 2 minutes& but was easily fixed with a bit of glue. It was ache so product& delivered quickly and perfect for what we needed it for!"
5064,1547,3," not bad ended up putting this in the bin before the night was up as it fell apart but for the price it was ok got a few laughs"
5065,1547,5," Loved this. Made a great |Robin Hood Zombie| at Halloween with this. Great fun was had by all concerned. Brilliant"
5066,1547,4," Arrived as requested express deliveryItem as described"
5067,1548,4," Bought it for myself to go on a girls night out.  Good size& comfy& good quality and looks good too!"
5068,1548,3," My daughter had a bug day at nursery& the wings looked great at first but when i picked her up from her three hours a nursery they looked good for the bin. I don't think anyone would need them for longer than that& so i guess it's okay"
5069,1548,5," i purchased these for my three Little nieces& & i also purchased three silver wands to go with the wings& they loved them."
5070,1548,5," borught two of these for a party for my grown up chldren. Fitted great and not too big. They could get on and off the bus or not cause any one to lose an eye in the pub. Wicked!"
5071,1548,5," These wings arrived promptly and were well packaged. Several friends and I wore our wings at a singing afternoon. They looked really good and withstood us dancing and leaning back into our seats. They are now hanging on the handles of my wardrobe while I think of another occasion to wear them."
5072,1548,4," I bought these wings for a dance costume. The product design was lovely but the wings rotated a lot whilst I wore them. Perhaps too small for me."
5073,1549,4," Bought this for my 16 yr old daughter. ..not too revealing as the zip comes up high. Good quality material too."
5074,1550,4," This was quite a nice little costume for the money. No problems with it& my little girl loved it. Thanks x"
5075,1550,5," Quick delivery& however& when I opened it I found the headband piece of the costume was snapped in two. I contacted the seller immediately and a replacement was sent out promptly. Fantastic customer service and the size fits my (nearly) 7 year old perfectly. Would recommend."
5076,1550,5," Very authentic looking. Children loved it."
5077,1550,5," Bought the large as my daughter is quite tall for 8& wanted it to reaxch the top of her shoes.  This was the perfect outfit for WW1 dress up for school.  It was comfortable enough to wear all day for school and washed well when she came home covered in chocolate and it looked like it had been in the wars!  Has been borrowed by others also now.  Good addition to any dress up collection that all mums need!"
5078,1550,4," This is a real hit with the children. Easy for them to put on and lasting well after a fair bit of usage"
5079,1550,4," Ordered for granddaughter's WW11 day at school. Great that it was all in one with no apron to lose. The hat was a bit flimsy"
5080,1550,3," Dress and headpiece as expected & perfect for dress up. Unfortunately it arrived too late after paying for guaranteed next day delivery . Although I was kept up to date with shipment& 2 days isn't good enough after paying extra for next day"
5081,1550,5," Good quality costume (i.e. not see-through!) and perfect for my daughter's Florence Nightingale dress-up day.  The fit was good - I chose a generous size as she's a tall 6 and it was great& with room for movement."
5082,1551,5," Great product.  I am a size 8 and ordered xs.  It fitted well but had plenty of room due to stretchy fabric& it would comfortable fit size 10 - 12"
5083,1552,5," Thank you"
5084,1553,5," A brilliant costume! My husband is xxl and it fits really well& plenty big enough and not too long in the length!"
5085,1553,3," My dad is a 50inch chest and this came up huge"
5086,1554,5," wore for a Works Fancy dress 80's theme"
5087,1555,4," Not bought from Amazon but arrived today I am a size 10-12 with a bit of a belly so went for the medium but should if gone for a small. The length is quite short I'm 5|1 and is not far of the picture which is good for me but someone tall might struggle. The hat is also very small. Over all its not bad for what I paid."
5088,1556,5," ALL MY GRANDSON WANTED FOR HIS BIRTHDAY PRESENT WAS A HOOK. I WENT ONE BETTER AND PURCHASED THE COSTUME.  HE WAS DELIGHTED WHEN HE OPENED THE PRESENT AND PUT IT ON RIGHT AWAY. IT FITTED WELL AND HE WORE IT AT HIS BIRTHDAY PARTY BOUNCING ON A BOUNCY CASTLE THE OUTFIT HELD UP VERY WELL. HE SAID IT WAS THE BEST PRESENT EVER!"
5089,1556,5," Bought this for my 5 year old to compliment his 3 year old brother's Peter Pan costume.  Hours of entertainment for the pair of them& and us adults watching them play."
5090,1556,5," My 2 (almost 3 year old) has worn this practically every day for the last 4 weeks! Its through the washing machine on a regular basis (even though it just says wipe clean) and it's holding up well& although at the rate we're going we might need to invest in a back up. He looks very cute in it and we've had lots of comments as I've trailed my little Captain Hook through town! Definitely recommend."
5091,1556,5," When I first ordered this costume I was really worried about the sizing& but i should not have worried as the size was perfect. I got a medium for my son who is 4. The quality is really good& and my boy looked so grand as Captain Hook for  a birthday party. Really happy would recommend especially from the seller Buy4less& really prompt."
5092,1556,5," I bought this costume expecting it not to last too long with an active three year old constantly doing battle with crocodiles!!! The costume is great and has endured. Two years later it has been passed down to the next generation of Peter Pan crew... It has been through the washing machine and has been a great purchase."
5093,1556,3," Would be great if the boot coverings stayed up& but they keep falling down so you cant see the buckle detail. A small bit of wire would fix the problem. Would buy again tho and my son likes wearing it. Also the hook is quite flimsy foam. Perhaps plastic would be better"
5094,1556,5," My little boy loved this. Fits very well and he's enjoyed being Captain Hook. We have the Peter Pan one too and they both seem really good quality. He wasn't too keen on the hook that came with the costume but we had a plastic one he's been using instead"
5095,1556,5," Bought this for a dress up day for my son. The quality is great and was a perfect fit for his size. The hat could have been a bit better as it didn't sit quiet right but my son wasn't bothered by it. Delivery was as expected. Very happy boy"
5096,1557,4," Needed this for a carnival float costume. It's not very durable so it wouldn't hold up to a lot of on/off dress up play. But for the occasional event or playtime& it's great (esp. for the price!). It was a VERY cold night and it was loose enough that I was able to layer under it. My daughter thought it was the best thing ever!"
5097,1557,3," Purchased this for the Ugly Bug Ball. Had read previous reviews and wasn't expecting much quality wise (just needed it to last the day). It did that& however upon the first wash it started to disintegrate. Served it's purpose"
5098,1557,5," Bought this outfit for a Roald Dahl day at my daughter's school and was perfect for the Ladybird from James and the Giant Peach!"
5099,1557,4," Good little costume"
5100,1558,5," Super duper service happy with product quality and value for money"
5101,1559,4," I bought this for my daughter to wear at school for the Diamond Jubilee as her year's theme was the Coronation. She wore it over a white dress with a blue sash and she looked the part. The cape is super and the crown has a velcro fastening at the back so it fits anyone."
5102,1559,5," Arrived quick& just how described& little one had it for a school dress up day n loved it :) he got lots of compliments"
5103,1559,5," Grandson thinks he is the king of the world with this - great quality"
5104,1560,5," Very good outfit and fitted perfectly"
5105,1560,5," Sexy Pirate Costume for Pirate Party"
5106,1560,5," Great for the money"
5107,1561,5," Good quality outfit not so great if you have a large ( over a D cup) bra size"
5108,1562,5," I don't consider this 'a toy' but more 'fancy dress'& as such its excellent value for money. Not tinny as I expected but good quality. I thought it would end up in the bin after party over but is in fact in with my costume Jewellery ."
5109,1562,5," Extremely quick service - the product arrived the next morning!  The tag is exactly what I expected - perfect for my fancy dress party!"
5110,1562,5," Upon recieving this item I was really pleased& it was just what I needed for my army fancy dress outfit. It isn't adjustable though& but that presented no problem as one size fits all really! Very comfortable to wear& a perfect item!"
5111,1562,5," This dog tag is without a doubt brilliant!!It has a nice long chain on it which makes it perfect size and sits just perfect.It does not look cheap and nasty& its well made and well put together and very durable.My 4 year old son has already claimed he wants it after im done with it.Really happy with this product& got super fast delivery& everything it says in the description!!"
5112,1562,4," I found this NEW dog tag neklace too be very sportty and also rather sexy& plus with a bit of tallent too as well. When I fancy dress& I always like to do& hence my being such a sporty man& right right? Much love this piece& overall a great buy leavng but munch to be dezired. Thanks atrillion!Best of love&Benji x"
5113,1562,5," Bought as part of dressing up items for my children's Army party. This felt very special to them and they were them any time they want to play soldier& both boys and girls as it's not something they'd normally wear of course. There was much excitement when they put these on. Excellent value and quality"
5114,1562,5," Better than expected& Nice long chain& good quality& shiny silver& and good font/clear on the actual dog tag"
5115,1562,4," I got this for my 9 year old because he's obsessed with all things army& he loves it although he did ask why it had the word s*x on it haha kids eh I obviously explained that meant if your a male or female"
5116,1563,5," Very good item! :))"
5117,1564,5," I ordered this item at the last minute.  It arrived promptly& and was perfect for the Halloween party.  I had prechecked the dress length so no nasty surprises (I'm 5'6|).  The dress has been machine washed in a net bag& on a gentle cycle and is still 100%.  Although it was a bit pricey for myself to pay out& it will be good value for future events."
5118,1564,5," Dress was grt good fitting and comfortable to wear."
5119,1565,5," I bought these shoes for my Halloween clown costume. They completed my outfit. They work great over school shoes. I am a child who has a size 5 shoe size. I love them"
5120,1565,4," Was plesently supprised didn't think they were gonna be very good when I saw them in the packet but once opened and placed over a pair of trainers very effective I was pleasantly supprise how good they looked on and the kids loved them!!"
5121,1565,4," bit dissapointed thought they would have been a little bit bigger but they will do for what i want them for .i think a bit over priced for what they are"
5122,1565,4," The item arrived quickly. It is a good product. I found them to be a little on the small side for my size UK 10 feet though!"
5123,1565,5," These just look great and are very easy to put on regardless of age and seize. They look absolutely awesome too."
5124,1565,5," Without this I could not have completed my clown's costume. It was bit tight for my shoes as my size is 10."
5125,1565,4," These are a fun novelty that are easy to put on and finish the outfit off nicely fitting most shoes."
5126,1565,5," these where the making of the scary clown and fitted weel and did not fall off or slip well done"
5127,1566,5," Perfect for my Australian float& better quality than I expected"
5128,1566,5," Great product. Just what I wanted."
5129,1566,4," good value"
5130,1567,5," Lenses kept falling out but ok for a fancy dress party"
5131,1567,5," Very impressed! ðŸ‘ðŸ¼"
5132,1567,5," lovely glasses"
5133,1567,4," Great item"
5134,1568,5," I ordered this dress for a cosplay event that I am going to. The seller contacted me as a problem was found with the item& but they were a great help and I managed to get the dress in time due to their hard work.The dress itself is absolutely stunning! With lots of detail such as frills& lace and ribbons. One thing I did worry about was the long sleeves& as it's warm at the moment& but the long white part of the sleeves is detachable and attached via small buttons. The skirt is very full and if you buy a petticoat as well it poofs out very nicely. The dress is a lot less heavy than I expected& and has some very cute details with the ribbon that changes the length of the pink overlay on the dress skirt.Overall this is a lovely dress& and very much worth the price."
5135,1568,5," this is a stunning little outfit& bought for my daughter's birthday and she loved it..has also been worn for a photo shoot and everyone loved it....one of the ribbon ties on the sleeve broke but to be fair that is minor and easily fixed"
5136,1568,5," I love this dress looks like it looks on the picture& i'm a x small and it fits perfectly you can adjust the size& very pleased with it definitely worth the money."
5137,1569,5," I ran around Warsaw in this costume and it got a great reception! I think it looks a lot better than the padded Iron Man costumes you can get hold of. I would suggest that you purchase a plastic mask and a couple of light-up hand repulsors to complete the look."
5138,1569,4," Pretty good outfit. A little tight but snug seeing I'm 5'10 and muscularly toned. The feet were tight as I'm size 10 but I wore thin socks seeing it was worn on a coldish night& Hence! Length was good.Thought I'd be better with the XL for overall size and as the head portion is a little awkward when zipping up at back (I have a broad back) and you'll have to manoeuvre the head so your eyes can see though the white eye slits& otherwise the head looks very odd if eyes are below this helmet area. Careful as there as two zips. One from the head zips down to back and also from lower back to mid portion of back/head.Seeing I'm wearing this once or twice& it'll get around for some more usage elsewhere in the household. It's fun& has character& reasonably cheap and I was centre stage for the costume party!A fun Buy!"
5139,1569,3," I cannot fault the service by the seller - only the product.  Yes it looks good from the front BUT the back is plain red and really not very attractive! :-("
5140,1569,5," Bought for my 13yr old son to wear on his rugby tour. Children's sizes all too small so ordered an adult but smallest available was a Medium. Fits really well with only a little excess round the neck but not baggy. Surprisingly good quality material."
5141,1569,5," I bought this and was extremely pleased with it& it looks amazing. Generally going with the sizing guide is your best shot but if in doubt i'd recommend going with the size up as its skin tight anyway and so better for it to be a bit too big than too small.I also would suggest being careful when you put it on as I tugged a bit too hard and ended up creating a rip on the seam& just be warned because it is a snug fit& be gentle!Overall great whether you want to impress at a fancy dress party or fight crime on the weekends."
5142,1569,3," This suit is pretty cool but unfortunately the medium was too small for me. I'm a 5'4| woman and a size 12. Admittedly my bum and thighs will be bigger than your average small framed guy but this was totally see through around the back! I would have bought a bigger size but with the hood on I couldn't see a thing and I felt quite claustrophobic& so unfortunately I'm sending mine back."
5143,1569,4," size is quite small for large and as another review mentioned no holes to see out from"
5144,1569,2," This is required for people with small feet As my brothers size 9's are very tight in this costume.  The rest fits well. But I wouldn't recommend for anyone who wears glasses.  Its says breathable& seeable but if you wear glasses it just steams up."
5145,1570,3," it didnt inflate in 30 seconds but about 30 minutes& and then it wasnt hard enough so sagged a little. so was a bit disappointed.but it arrived very soon after ordered so very pleased with that. couldnt return it as my son was using it the day after it arrived!"
5146,1570,3," The suit looked very good when fully inflated& but the battery life only lasted just over an hour until the suit started deflating. I didn't have any duracell batteries& so it's important to tell the buyer of what batteries are most effective to use."
5147,1570,5," this was a fantastic Christmas present. I bought it for my boss and he and the family and a few friends all had a great time with it."
5148,1570,5," It was very good& stayed inflated when motor was running& and did as stated. Made a good impression and will use it again sometime"
5149,1570,5," Very pleased to see that it actually inflated well and stayed up. My son wore it to a party and said it got lots of laughs!"
5150,1570,5," Decent quality& inflates very quickly and lasted longer than it was needed to. Will use it again in the future."
5151,1570,4," good costume&needs elastic round waist&keeps coming undone clips not good enough.would buy again."
5152,1570,5," Delivered quickly. Looks good. A bit bulky if in a confined space."
5153,1571,5," I rated this product low in durability"
5154,1571,3," Bought this for a lil bit of fancy dress sticks on well but didn't stay on the whole night. Still for the money a grate buy try not to get it wet."
5155,1571,5," Great product sticks to your face like glue& Even was able to have a beer whilst wearing it. Really life like and looks the business"
5156,1571,4," Actually bought this for my PG Tips monkey and turned it into a mohican hair cut and goatee beard. Wicked."
5157,1571,3," As expected"
5158,1572,5," Excellent product. Pretty and comfortable. Can wear for a number of years as expandable waist. Detachable apron is pretty also."
5159,1573,5," Necklace as seen delivered promptly"
5160,1574,5," I find it quite hard sometimes to accesorise.Fashion hasn't always been my forte.With these shrek ears I feel invincible I feel like vogue will call me any minute.Any modelling queries contact me.Stay flawless xox"
5161,1574,4," This product came very quickly& as recorded delivery which I wasn't expecting. As a bonus the ears light up& which I was not aware of when I purchased these& so that was an excellent surprise. My one very silly gripe would be that these were bought as a present& but the cardboard backing they were one had been bent to get them in an envelope for postage- which is going to look a little bit untidy when I give this to my mother and father in law& but I imagine when they realise that the ears light up they will overlook this oversight."
5162,1574,5," Bought shrek ears as part of a fancy dress costume for baby shrek.... Ears worked great! Loved the flashing lights in ears! Great extra touch!!"
5163,1574,5," This product was very good& me and my friends enjoyed using them to please the great Shrek. Shrek is love& Shrek is life!"
5164,1574,3," What can you say about Shrek's ears??? These are a bit small for adults& but bearable for an afternoon or evening."
5165,1574,5," This is an excellent product and a good price.My local Fancy Dress Shop wanted to charge a lot more!"
5166,1574,2," unfortunately when the ears arrived - one side of the headband was snapped. It came with no tags& cardboard backing or anything to indicate it was 'new'. Wasn't worth sending back as it would cost more for posting than I paid for it. I was disappointed AND they didn't light up which I thought they would :("
5167,1574,5," Perfect for the price I paid.  Got them for my son as we are going to Shrek the Musical. They are charging Â£8 for them at the theatre. Abit disappointed that they don't light up as I read a couple of reviews and seen that some people received light up ones.  My son is happy though."
5168,1575,5," Excellent quality and arrived two days later"
5169,1576,4," Was just the job for my song's play st school. He really took to the part. :-) :-)"
5170,1576,5," Great costume and fits perfectly !!"
5171,1577,5," Looked great for a fancy dress night& I'm a bigger size and it fit great& his all the right bits but still felt sexy! My friend who was a lot smaller has the same and also looked fab!"
5172,1577,5," Could not ask for a better fit and quality& looked great with a corset and body stocking& will recommend highly."
5173,1577,5," Happy with this only thing be open minded if you want to match colours as they may differ. For me not a problem."
5174,1577,4," Just what I wanted for a Halloween party& looks good."
5175,1578,3," Its ok for what it is but the hat is fully made of plastic."
5176,1578,5," Ordered for hubby for party looked the part quality fine but shoe covers a bit tricky to fit so he didn't bother"
5177,1579,3," It isn't the quality seen in the picture. There is lose threads everywhere& there is also grey fluff balls that get stuck to the white area of the cloak. I am 160cm and it only comes up to just above my hips! It makes me look wide and huge because of that. There is a strange material underneath totoro's face that sticks out through the seams (Like tissue Paper). I'd only buy this for little kids for dressing up.I give it 1 extra star just because It is warm."
5178,1579,5," My daughter loves it.  It's incredibly soft and very warm"
5179,1579,5," This cloak is very nicely designed and actually fits& which I am pleased about as it's a one size (and I am& shall we say& rotund). The material is quite thin& but it's nice and fleecy& and if you want the edges have poppers that you can use to make sleeves. There is also a popper at the front to keep the front closed. The hood is a good size& and the ears are sturdy enough that if you balance them right they will stand up instead of just flopping over. Customer service was also very good. Would be happy to order similar items again."
5180,1579,5," After reading reviews I genuinely wasn't expecting much for the price&  yet once it was delivered I was amazed at the quality and accuracy of this item. I genuinely don't understand why this has bad reviews. The fabric is amazingly soft like a expensive plush toy and the face is incredibly accurate even with the finest details of the whiskers and the sleeve system is awesome!  I bought this just to snuggle up in around my house as it's quite cold but it's so nice I feel like I'll ruin it. Amazing value for money!"
5181,1579,5," I advice people before they buy that they should consider that it is shipping from a country that sell clothes sizes smaller than us in the UK or America.I loved the design& very much like the one in the photo& I am a little confused why the whiskers are only on one side of the hood.I did have some slight small stains on the teeth inside the hood& but it does not bother me that much as I'm guessing it was factory made.I find the material very soft though and comfy to wear around the house and to lounge in."
5182,1579,5," I bought this for my fiancÃ©s birthday but couldnt help myself and had to try it on& its very well made& the quality of the actuall material/fur is very good. Unlike other reviewers I think the size is perfectly fine& definately the right size for most adults or teenagers. I love this and may have to steal it occasionally"
5183,1579,5," its so lovely and cosy and it fits me and I'm an adult and is big enough to keep me cosy& my teenage daughter is going to love it.  really lovely packaging and badge comes with it too."
5184,1579,3," It's OK& not the best made product to be honest& and the face was wonky.We still have no idea how to attach the poppers to make arms :) but that could just be us.We just loved the idea of a Totoro cloak& but it just wasn't that good a quality& wonky face& stitching hanging off& fluff everywhere. A bit disappointing overall. Sorry& I truly wish I could say it was better because we loved the idea of the cloak."
5185,1580,5," Brilliant they really love them"
5186,1581,4," Needed this for my husband for a 2hr carnival procession. Got it next day free delivery and it cost less than Â£5! Very pleased. Not the best quality but for such a great price and delivery& it did the job perfectly! And our team won 2nd prize overall!"
5187,1581,4," Was a great outfit! Came on time and had such an enjoyable evening :-) would deffo recomend to anyone thinking of doing a caveman theme!"
5188,1581,4," My son wore this for a charity volley ball match. Good costume and well made as it lasted through the day and is still in one piece."
5189,1581,1," this is a terrible product&....we threw it in garbage right away& not even possible to donate to charity....what a waste!"
5190,1581,5," Bought this for a costume for a caveman party. Great product& fits well& and material is as expected."
5191,1581,4," Good fancy dress costume& which fits as per normal UK sizes (if you're a medium& buy the medium etc"
5192,1581,3," Only issue was keeping the shoulder part on! had to clip it shut! very baggy"
5193,1582,4," Great outfit for Halloween& fast delivery"
5194,1583,4," Nice weight and good chain length it complimented my fancy dress outfit as Slash the catch spring failed during the evening but I was able to bend it to keep it on.If the catch had not failed I would have given it 5 starsCan't complain too much as it was cheap and was only for the one night."
5195,1583,3," It arrived quickly but as soon as I took it out of the bag the middle 'jewel' fell out!!! No matter I stuck it back with a bit of glue and its fine.Using it as costume jewellery for an 80's night - its a bit heavy but looks just right!!!"
5196,1583,5," very good quality for price &I thought it would look cheap but it didn't & nice and heavy & could wear it as costume jewelry."
5197,1583,5,""
5198,1583,5," This jewelled cross was actually quite amazing.  It was heavy and quite large and fully of crystals.  It look much more expensive than it actually was and totally completed the Ozzy Osbourne look for a party."
5199,1583,5," Bought for Madonnas fancy dress and looked fab& but quality is so good I've worn it several times since as a 'proper' necklace! Excellent service from this seller& highly recommended&."
5200,1583,5," Excellent piece of kit& finished off my ozzy Osborne fancy dress outfit perfectly&fantastic value for money!!! Bargain"
5201,1583,5," I bought this for a friend going to a party as Slash. It looked great against his black t shirt. Delivery was on time and purchased for a good price."
5202,1584,5," ok"
5203,1585,4," Bought for a fancy dress birthday party& got the size large which will fit size 14-16. Great outfit which I hope to use again!"
5204,1586,2," The costume arrived within a few days and my son was really excited about wearing his King Arthur outfit. Unfortunately& it is cheap material and unlikely to last very long - you'd probably refer to it as 'tat'.He's only worn it twice and it's already frayed in areas. He loves the outfit but I think it has been a waste of money - if only I was good at sewing!"
5205,1586,1," Got this costume for aged 6-8 yr olds from party delights-terrible quality. The silvery trousers were snagged in many places& no belt came with it"
5206,1586,5," This is a great costume for dressing up. My 5 year old has had lots of fun with it so far. Good quality too."
5207,1586,4," Very well received by grandson aged 4"
5208,1586,3," Looks really good until lots of children start to wear it.  Leggings are scratchy and tend to catch on the velcro.  Elasticated footwear did not last long before it was broken.  However& the children loved wearing it all."
5209,1586,3," Great wee suit got it for my 4 year old he loves it but silver fabric plucks easy and i personally wouldnt let him wear it any where near a naked flame."
5210,1586,5," Nephew loved this& especially the parts that go over the top of your boots! Exactly what he wanted and good value for money."
5211,1586,5," This item is axcellent value for money. My nephew who is 4& has worn it everywhere and slained every monster imaginable."
5212,1587,4," as expected"
5213,1588,5," Really good costume& well designed and comfortable. Would recommend - its obviously going to worn for novelty purposes so good for the purpose its intended."
5214,1588,4," Mmm does the job& very revealing but overall a good purchase."
5215,1589,4," I bought this for my 20 yr old son. He says that he has wanted one for ages and he is delighted with it."
5216,1589,5," Great fitting and well made piece of fancy dress.  Only drawback is the lack of eye holes and having to strip off to go to the toilet.  Looks great."
5217,1589,5," The morph suit .looks great on and is a real fu costume.The thingis you can be as silly as you likein it and nobody knows its you"
5218,1589,5," Great fun... Fitted well& I have a skinny build but at 6'3 I want sure if it would fit but it was just snug"
5219,1590,5," Good quality costume at a good price and the headpiece is fantastic & all you need to add is a pair of leggings"
5220,1590,5," Cool costume and arrived quickly:)"
5221,1591,5," Excellent quality and price."
5222,1592,4," Had and eye mask included. Not fantastic quality& but more than acceptable for the price and purpose. All in all& very happy with my purchase."
5223,1593,4," Great buy. The fringe goes around the whole dress unlike other flapper dresses. The plastic buckles that hold the shoulder stripes are a bit weak and can break but I changed them easily. I am size 10 but the dress is a bit tight in the heaps - so if you want to dance tango& get one that is a size bigger."
5224,1593,4," I'm a size 12 and 10-12 fitted fine. Do find the tassles all over the floor though but still served its purpose. Fast delivery and packaged in protective bag."
5225,1593,4," Bought this for a fancy dress hen-do. As noted in some of the other reviews& this dress does have a tendency to shed a bit&  especially when first taken out of the packaging& but it was fine on the night. Arrived very quickly. I was a bit dubious about buying online but this fit very well. I am a size 10-12 with rather curvy hips but this fit fine."
5226,1593,5," This dress was delivered promptly and of the highest quality! The picture is very true in terms of length and this dress has adjustable straps. Heavy weighted dress and ideal for party& theatre costume or fancy dress. Excellent."
5227,1593,4," Looks good with tassels all way round dress. Most other dresses I looked at just had tassels at the front& however& the sizing is on the small side& so be warned. I'm a size 10-12 so got that but it only just fits!"
5228,1594,3," the suit came with damp mouldy patches on the helmet& i guess its not a biggie as you can just clean it but was a little annoying& the suit overall is really good quality and with the bonus of the removable mask& going to be getting my glasto on in this bad boy"
5229,1594,5," Hubby loved it"
5230,1594,4," High quality material& fast delivery& only issue is the lack of gun. All replicas and even nerf stormtrooper guns are very expensive so I ended up buying a Â£6 plastic rifle on eBay (actually was a lot better than expected& sounds& vibration and lights).Still a good buy overall though& relative to renting a real plastic costume."
5231,1595,4," As usual with these things& the material isn't the greatest but overall it was OK.  I just wish they wouldn't use velcro on the costumes because it always catches the material elsewhere and ends up spoiling it.  It was nice to have the headband included and the fit for a tall 5 year old was good."
5232,1595,5," I bought this for my 6 year old niece and she wore it for 3 days only taking it off to sleep. Great value for money better than the disney shop version which is cheaper made."
5233,1595,5," Bought for two little nieces on their birthday& the actual dress was the better version of the dark turquoise version (which I originally wanted) so I was extremely pleased to see the little princesses in their costumes!"
5234,1595,5," this was for my 6 year old daughter she loves it& quality is good& and prompt delivery. I did have a look at others but this one was good quality fir the price"
5235,1595,5," My daughters 6 and loves this dress. would definitely recommend This to anyones child that loves dressing up and brave like mine."
5236,1595,4," The product was not quite what I expected it to look like but seems fine nevertheless. The colour is darker. I cannot say whether it will be hard wearing or not& as it is being sent abroad to my granddaughter for Christmas"
5237,1595,4," The dress is darker in colour than it looks in the provided photo& but my 5 year old loves it regardless. The material is better than I expected and compared to many other costumes I've bought."
5238,1595,5," Bought this for my granddaughter& Grace and she absolutely loves it. Any girl who enjoys dressing up and sees herself as a bit of a princess in the making will love it too."
5239,1596,3," I was pleased with the product but the reason I bought 2 pairs was that I needed one for a 7 year old and one for a 10  year old which was perfect because it stated that they fitted 6 to 12 but unfortunetaly they were far too small for the 10 year old and she is just an average 10 year old& no bigger than she should be for her age. Saying that they are good quality tights."
5240,1596,1," Ordered what was described as plus size tights for an adult witches costume. The tights were either made for a plus size child or an adult below 4ft 6| in height as the tights barely passed my knees!!! Because I had obviously tried them on& I couldn't return them so I'm stuck with a product that is poorly labelled and evidently badly described - a total waste of money!!"
5241,1596,5," I bought these tights as part of a halloween 'raggy doll' costume.I was worried they wouldn't fit properly as I'm 5' and size 6 but they were fine.Brilliant for fancy dress. Would definately recommend."
5242,1596,3," These are great tights - but tight is the word. I am a size 16 and I could just about wear them (needed for a costume). I had something on over them otherwise they would have rolled down. Great tights though& nice and strong and a great colour."
5243,1596,2," I dis not open these until the evening of the event I needed them for and was very annoyed to find a hole and a ladder running from mid calf to toe. The pair I also bought for a friend at the same time also had exactly the same fault. For the price this was a very poor buy and it was too late to do anything about it or get replacements."
5244,1596,4," Excellent addition to a Where's Wally outift. I am 5'8 and they were a little short in the leg but not too bad. They are sturdy and survived a 16 hours of wear& numerous forms of transport and a night on the tiles without any problems. (It was for a charity event - I don't normally dress as Where's Wally!)"
5245,1596,4," These tights went perfectly with my Cirque Sinister Poiret costume.  My only criticism is that they are one size fits all and after being worn for a couple of hours became a little loose.  To be honest its not even a criticism really as it meant I was super compfortable."
5246,1596,5," These were really good quality for the price. I was a little worried that they might be a little small as the models on the pictures have legs like sticks but I was pleasantly surprised as they are a good size and fitted very comfy over my size 16 hips.They also are quite strong fabric which didn't ladder or tear even though I was wearing them for the full night. Over all a very good product and did the job perfectly."
5247,1597,4," Just what I needed for my son to dress up as something British for his school UN day"
5248,1597,5," Fits perfect. Ideal for occasion. Many thanks."

5260,1600,4," Its a good nicely fine detailed little scale model.  I bought it as it seems a somewhat unique vehicle& I have other 1:76 scale cars that I owned or drove in my early 20's for the idea of photographic 'mini scenes' featuring these cars.For the hearse here I bought scale model headstones pack& but I think I must buy one or two of the limousine versions of this vehicle to complete the scene.It comes screwed to a base in a dedicated transparent plastic box for display if required."

He was thrilled with it.As always from Siku this is of good quality& however there are a lot of small plastic parts (wing mirrors etc) that do look like they could break off quite easily if not looked after.Overall a great addition to his collection."
5324,1632,5," My Grandson thoroughly enjoyed this well made toy"
5325,1633,4," Bought this for a friend as kind of a joke birthday present as she always wanted this exact bike. She was very impressed with the detail on the model and loved the gift. Postage was very quick& it got here on time. However I think 15 quid is a bit much for a model& if there was a cheaper one I would have bought it instead. Overall good quality product& though I would say it's more of a collectable than a toy."
5326,1634,5," Grandson delighted with birthday gift"

5333,1639,5," I used to drive one of these 50 years ago so I know them well. This is a very good representation of the real thing. It sits very happily on a OO gauge layout."

5342,1642,5," This is a great toy.  We already had one for my son from the U.S. so I bought it for a friend as a gift.  Her son loves it.  When it arrived& we could not get the power wrench to work.  Fortunately& customer service was excellent.  They tested a new power wrench for me and sent it out immediately so I did not have to return the entire package."
5343,1642,5," Had to buy one of these for my son after seeing his cousin receive one as Christmas"
5344,1643,5," I was hoping this 'stang would be blue when it arrived and it was!The blue version is quite difficult to get hold of but this is definitely a blue mustang so if you have been searching for a blue one look no further!Also this is a great model from maisto& possibly one their best ever and for the price I paid I have no complaints whatsoever."
5345,1644,5," HiI just want to say Thank You to Amazon UK and the Model Car World company for a really quick delivery. The car arrived in a big box which was really well packed and the car was perfect! I love the car and will be going on display with the other cars in my die cast car collection. Thank You again."
5346,1644,5," Top quality"

5356,1648,4," loved"
5357,1649,5," Very good quality model for that price& nice addition to my collection!"
5358,1650,5," This item is more of a durable collectable model rather than a toy that is intended for daily use as such. It is& however& incredibly realistic and mimics the Wiking factory style of the 1960's."
5359,1651,5," Very good"
5360,1652,5," great detailing at a very reasonable price"
5361,1653,5," brought for my brother he loved it"

5366,1657,4," This 1985 Chevrolet Corvette ZR-I is one of the littler known Bond cars to feature in a movie. Which starred the cool Roger Moore as it turned out to be his last movie as the secret agent. The Corvette was not much more than a stunning way of trnsport for Bond in this movie. As he has to go to Silicon Valley in Nevada to beat Zorof which ends in a fight on a small airship over the Golden Gate bridge. The Corvette is an American legend and has lasted since the late 50's with the newest still being produced. So with looks and power it was a brilliant choice as a Bond car for the era and marked a change in direction in the film series. Joyride have done a decent job but the fit and finish is quite poor which lets this down. All the door's open up and the roof panel comes off to show the black plastic interior which isn't to bad."
5367,1658,5," A superb kit of a different vehicle from the norm. Incredibly highly detailed with fantastic quality throughout. I'm a big fan of Meng kits now."
5368,1658,4," Great kit but incorrectly labelled as including the ZU-23 AA gun. It actually includes the ZPU-2 (as on the box pictured)."
5369,1658,5," Excellent"
5370,1659,5," I wish Peterkin would do more models. My husband and son are both truck enthusiasts. This is our second Peterkin and they both comment on how much more detail these models have compared to similarly priced Corgi models. Considering my son is 9 years old and notices straight away?"
5371,1659,5," Fantastic lorry bought for my husband who collects them these are as good as the corgi models very authentic highly recommended."
5372,1659,5," Great quality at a fraction of the cost of some of the leading brands on the market at the minute"
5373,1659,5," this truck i bart to go with all my truck collection i like the look of it the paint work and all the time thats gone into it i see thees trucks on the motorways"
5374,1659,5," Fabulous little lorry my grandson loves it&but more so my husband does to marvellous product for the money and extremely good quality"
5375,1659,5," very detailed model of the volvo curtain sider wagon looks fab will be a great addition to my boyfriends model wagon collection. x"
5376,1659,5," Our son loves this little lorry. It's played with all the time and is still in perfect condition."
5377,1659,5," On a par with Corgi when it comes to scaled vehicles."
5378,1660,5," Model is Corgi car size.  Fantastic detail.  Even has Bond and Tracy inside wearing the correct clothing! Will buy more in this range."
5379,1660,5," delighted with this car my grandson thought it was magic very quick delivery"
5380,1660,5," It's great!"
5381,1661,5," Good basic model& but models of this type require just a little more detail - even if this increases price. All in all& quite satisfied."
5382,1662,5," Bought this for a relatives little boy"
5383,1662,4," GRANDSON WAS OVER THE MOON. TRUCK WAS NOT TO PLASTIC. BRILLIANT ESPECIALLY FOR PRICE"
5384,1662,5," my grandson loves it good value for money"
5385,1663,5," Bought this for a token gift as it was my friends first car .Good quality very happy and arrived very quickly  over Xmas"
5386,1663,3," Lovely car but I did think it was going to bigger then what it was."
5387,1664,5," i ordered this for dad for his birthday& its just the car he use to drive& it was his bride and joy and unfortunatly a year to day someone smashed into him& its a very hard colour to get.. he now has a mini model of it now . speedy and delivery and and came as describted"
5388,1664,5," Good detail."
5389,1665,5," There are several different listings for this item and although the description and picture don't make it clear& this is the 1:15 model with lights and sounds. I also have the Sun Star 1:18 models which are real die cast models but these Diamond Select models are much more fun to look at. Now if only the other 3 versions of the Diamond Select BTTF Delorean would also be available this cheap..."
5390,1665,5," My 7 year old grandson just couldn't wait to get one after watching the film. A little fragile for playing but he treats it with care and has had hours of fun already.  The seller was really good about a replacement too."
5391,1666,4," I really like this model but I have to say there are some quality control issues at Corgi. The first one arrived and had a bent connecting rod on one side. This was sent back and replaced by amazon without any quibble - well done Amazon. Then the second arrived which while had no defects like the previous one was not seated correctly on the track. This was easily fixed by loosening the screws underneath and repositioning the loco and tender in the correct position. The point is I should not have had to do this. At a RRP of Â£30 the least Corgi could do is to make sure the models that it sells are up to scratch - it's not a lot to ask - is it?"
5392,1666,5," High-quality and detailed die-cast model of the fastest steam locomotive& having achieved 126mph on 3rd July 1938& a record which still stands today. This static model is supplied on its own railed plinth within a perspex display case. This item deserves to be exhibited prominently and will prove to be a great conversation piece. Furthermore& given the planned 75th Anniversary celebrations of the World Record at the NRM& York& later this year (when all 6 remaining A4s will be displayed together)& this model will be the ideal gift for any steam enthusiast in 2013 and promises to be a cherished collector's item in years to come."
5393,1666,4," I bought this for a present& i came really quick with amazon prime and i was relieved that i had got him a present he liked and decided to open it up& but when i did i could hear rattling in the case& so i opened that up and a piece flew out and i don't know weather it broke off or simply must be placed somewhere as per everything nowadays the non existent paper work was not helpful if anyone on the off chance knows what piece this please let me know thanks otherwise a good buy if you like trains"
5394,1666,5," This in my opinion is NOT a toy it is an accurate Die-Cast model which as a lover of steam trains as I am& provides a delightful reminder of how things used to be. I have seen the actual Mallard and can only say that in my opinion this model is very accurate in its detail. I shall leave my model in its display container and just look at it in passing. It is a pity that the other models in the series are so much more expensive and I cannot think why."
5395,1666,4," The reason for the four star rating is simply that I was asked to review it as a |toy|. It ain't. It is a small& finely detailed scale model which& whilst nice to handle& is better suited to display.Corgi has captured the lines and grace of the A4 Pacific beautifully. The colours look right& although I was not around to see it in this early form. Very pleased with the finish& box etc& and amazed at the low cost attributable& no doubt& to its Chinese origins."
5396,1666,5," Ideal for Xmas Present / Birthday Gift for mantle piece / side board or wall unit for Adult or Child over 10"
5397,1666,5," This has to be the most sort after steam train in the world& My Great Grandfather worked in the loco sheds in Doncaster at the time the Mallard was being built& As a child my Grandfather would get out his photo's with his father working in the loco sheds"
5398,1667,4," We got this set for our 2 year old son. We were looking into B-World vehicles for a while but have been hesitant to get due to the price tag and scale of the range (1:16). This set is reasonably priced and looked like a suitable introduction to the range.the quality is decent with plenty of detail. However& those are entry level vehicles and some areas are rather simplistic. For example& none of them provides access to the cab. For example the construction worker we also bought& cannot be slotted in the cab.Nevertheless& they seem to be robust despite the high density plastic they are made off. the assembly of these toys is amazing.Every part is slotted seamless and you will not see any gaps or fiddly bits.Other elements such as the mirrors are made of flexible plastic and they can be folded& meaning there is very little risk of breaking them.The stickers are made of vinyl& not paper and they are fully waterproof . The rear sticker that resembles the light of the truck was stuck slightly offset but I just peeled it off and repositioned it easily.Both vehicles have a tow bars but unfortunately they cannot be coupled together.The tipper box is moving nicely and can be locked in the highest position. That said& in this position there is some possibility of little fingers being trapped between the chassis and the box but I doubt there is any risk of injury.I like the fact hat the truck tires are made of soft materials but at the same time impossible to come off. It would haven been nice if the loader also had soft tires. They are not and having hard plastic ones is probably  for keeping production costs low. At this scale however& hard tires do not look natural.The loader mechanism is a marvel to observe.Read more â€º"

5451,1695,4," Grandson enjoyed playing with it well made."
5452,1696,4," Son likes it very much.  Is to scale with all his other Matchbox& Hot Wheels cars but it is VERY small.  Picture does make it look much bigger than it is."
5453,1696,2," A nice model but it is not the size advertised of 7Â·8 cm &it is less than half that !"
5454,1696,5," Very pleased with detail and really blends with my modelling."

5464,1704,4," The model is very detailed. Feels well put together. Paintjob is nicely executed and interior has a lot of details aswell"
5465,1705,5," very pleased with the land rover discovery it is well made but not really a toy more a show piece"
5466,1705,5," Lovely unit& well built and great prompt service for Christmas."
5467,1705,4," Bought for my 4 year old son but not for kids. Everything has broken off& side mirrors& wheels. Such a pity. More for display purposes than playing with."
5468,1706,5," I liked the quality and presentation of this detailed model.  It is most pleasing.  Not a toy to give to a child under eight...  Well one could& but it seems too good!"
5469,1707,5," Brilliant model"
5470,1708,4," i really like this car& great detail and came quickly. quite a wide turning circle& so not great for small spaces& and you have to fiddle with the steering trim on the bottom to get it to drive straight& but overall really nice& and very durable.NOTE: only thing is& my brother has a maisto lamborghini from the same range& and we can't drive the cars at the same time because they run off the same frequency. not overly a problem for me& although can sometimes be annoying. overall& there are some minor setbacks& but the detail is excellent& service good& easy and fun to use."
5471,1708,5," Excellent value for my 8 year old. Small enough to use in the home but big enough to not see too small. Doesn't need add many batteries as some others either."
5472,1708,5," Prompt service.excellent goods"
5473,1708,5," very happy& thank you"
5474,1708,5," ðŸ‘"
5475,1709,5," The model is small I could not believe it but I must say it dus look good and it came in a nice case& and that's dus macke up for the size and the delivery was ferry good"
5476,1709,5," Got this for my husband from my little boy. He has a model railway that he has based in 50-60's so loved the purchase"
5477,1709,3," Very good but case came with no label& and as it is a collectors item should be labelled. Abit disappointing"
5478,1709,5," Was smaller than I thought it would be as haven't brought this kind of things before& husband liked it"
5479,1709,4," Just to small in size would have been better if bigger"
5480,1709,3," it wasnt made clear it was so small"
5481,1710,5," brilliant"
5482,1710,5," excellent"
5483,1711,3," I bought this as a funny for a mate who keeps on about purchasing a military land rover exactly the same as the one he used in the army as a signals specialist ... His partner won't let him buy one so the nearest he has got to one is this small and I mean small model. It's not really a toy as such and is more of a collectible. It's pretty accurate as small models come and was recieved by my mate with great humore . So I was pleased and he was pleased."
5484,1711,5," These landrover models are ideal for trainset model layoutstoo scale 00 and wargaming diaramas of diffrent modern armies& aprt from the British."
5485,1711,5," Great product and service"
5486,1712,5," A truly 100% excellent model !!!"
5487,1713,4," received nice item"
5488,1714,4," My grandson Josh got this for his birthday and it was played with immediately& not sure how long it will last with him as toys need to be tough."
5489,1714,4," Really good great detail the one thing I found slightly annoying is the steering/turning circle is very poor"
5490,1714,5," Perfect& thank you"
5491,1714,5," great"
5492,1715,5," Great addition to my star wars cars and even though it gives me 2 r2d2 cars the one in the twin pack has a distressed finish which makes even better. Thank you hot wheels!"
5493,1715,5," They look really goodCan't wait to see my sons face ChristmasMorning.Arrived really quickThank you"
5494,1715,5," Having purchased the 5 pack of star wars cars on the lightening deal i had to have these to add to the collection even though i saw them after i had ordered the chewbacca one individualy & but my fault and someone got it as a gift! Neverless these are great collectables for any star wars fan."
5495,1715,3," Awesome."
5496,1716,5," Very good"
5497,1717,5," nice little model for slot car conversion"
5498,1718,3," Got this for my 1/6th scale terminator as I couldn't find a Harley Davidson. For the price this is a happy substitute"
5499,1718,5," Bought this for two reasons. One& I have the actual bike and Two& to use it as a prop for the Hot Toys Terminator figure. Very happy with this item and very happy with the price as other sites are selling this for MUCH more money.  Arnie seems very happy with it too !"
5500,1718,5," If you're looking for a 1:6 scale bike to show off your Hot Toys Terminator& this does a great job. Not a lot of diecast in it& but creates a very nice effect."
5501,1718,5," this was a christmas gift for my husband as he rides the real thing and wanted the model he loved it"
5502,1719,5," thanks to hot wheels high definitions now we can enjoy this replica!!!! since corgi toys stopped making greats die cast of movies! now only we can get some great die cast by hot wheels only!"
5503,1720,5," Fab& my son collects this size of car and the LaFerrari is one of his ultimate favourites. Good quality& sturdy and Ferrari red!"
5504,1721,5," This was a christmas gift for my Grandson. He is very much into farm machinery. When he got the christmas wrapping off he got very excited and couldn't open the box fast enough.Delivery was was quick and by the time given."
5505,1721,5," My Grandson loved it& and he has so much fun playing with it.  I thought it was good value. A sturdy& safe toy."
5506,1721,5," Bought this with the class tractor and baler.  Little boy loves them and has had great fun playing with them.  This combine is a good size too as it can be taken anywhere."
5507,1721,5," Bought this for my two year old grandson& he just loves it& he knows all the makes of farm machinery and is thrilled with his first combine harvester."
5508,1721,3," When looking at it on the computer. My nephew thought it was a bit bigger than what arrived to his door he was a bit disappointed but he's now got used to it and he plays with it with his make shift farm."
5509,1721,5," I bought this for my 4 year old nephew for Christmas& and he was delighted with it. He lives machinary& and has already had hours of play with it. It was well made too."
5510,1721,4," Smaller than I had hoped - but my fault as not very good with centimetres- give me inches and I'm fine. - grandson pleased with it"
5511,1721,5," Order came within days.... Although i got the size wrong for my little boy!!!Apart from that everything was fine"
5512,1722,5," ICM 35533 Typ 770k (W150) Tourenwagen. German Leaders Car 1:35 i will enjoy making this model& as the detail is very good"
5513,1722,5," goods deliveredgood quality productbrilliant will make a good addition to my WW2 collection"
5514,1723,5," Another great little model for military collectors in 1/72 scale& detailing is clear and sharp and it looks great alongside other vehicles of the same era."
5515,1724,5," nicely made"
5516,1724,5," good model"
5517,1725,5," outstanding"
5518,1726,4," I'm a big fan of Meng kits and have been waiting for this one to be released for quite some time. I did look at the Takom version but that has some build 'challenges' that I didn't fancy. The Meng has the same level of detail but is a joy to build - besides the tracks it can be finished over a weekend. The two areas that you may have expected to be problematic have had some thought put into them to make it as easy as possible. The wheels are built so that instead of been sandwiched between the inner and outer plates are placed on axels that are part of the inner plate. This means that getting everything lined up is very simple. The next part is the hull itself. A large part of the lower hull is moulded as one piece and the 'turret' starts with a single piece that is then bent to shape. This gives a solid foundation for adding the rest of the plates. I still had a small amount of filing to do but it was all far easier to get everything square.The downsides? There is no PE and this really should have used to get inscale thickness for the attachment points for the canvas track covers. The stowage bins often seen in pictures are included. The individual tracks are rather time consuming to clean up with three attachment points. Finally& the tow cable is string and not metal.Overall highly rated especially if& like me& you prefer to concentrate on the painting stage and not the build stage."
5519,1726,5," Lovely kit from meng if this ww1 tank"
5520,1727,5," i got this model in 1 day it was really quick and really packed well when i opened the box and looked at the model it had lots of details no flash on it or parts missing or bent or anything. i have to give the shop 5 stars for service really good and well buy of them again would say to anyone looking for a good bargain and good service this is the shop"
5521,1728,5," This really is a little gem of a kit. The moulding is crisp and clean with sharp panel lines and no flash to speak of. All of the detail is finely engraved  and would put some 1/35 kits to shame. The only down side is that the wheels have hollow backs but this is only a very minor problem. The great thing about these kits is that they are easy to put together for the younger modeller but the detailing of the kit it so good that the more experienced builder could really turn this kit into something special. Overall this offering from Fujimi is brilliant and this is the seller you should be buying these kits from. if you do some research you'll see why  (just amazing.) Highly recommend."
5522,1729,5," Birthday present for my son. An excellent little kit. Is it the last in the world at this scale?"
5523,1730,4," This is a great kit for the money. It is a 1970's mould but the parts fit together well and to the usual high standard you expect from Tamiya. Has made me hungry for a more advanced model in their 1:35 tanks series!My only criticism is that wit the exception of the miniature crew& there are no paint instructions. This was strange but i used tamiya acrylic dark yellow and green which has given a good likeness to the box picture."
5524,1730,5," I bought this from buyforlessonline at a great price with free delivery& this is an old tamiya kit but i think it is a good one& you get a lot for your money& the quality is spot on& the instructions are excellent and easy to follow and you will end up with a great model. Its a bit limited for the serious modeller& but is a good base if you want to customize. Could have done with more info on the tank and some unit details too but these are minor complaints considering the price of this kit. Overall an excellent kit that is fun and straightforward to build and great value for money."
5525,1730,5," What can I say& parts fit together nicely& hardly any flashing& no good for kids if they want to use it as a toy as tracks do not move freely. Looks great when built& nice size."
5526,1730,4," Bought this as it's cheap and I wanted something to practise and make mistakes on during an Airbrushing Course I recently attended. This is an old kit and there are better (more expensive& more parts& more complicated) Panther models out there. This wouldn't necessarily suit the more experienced modellers& however it's ideal for the beginner& it has relatively few parts& goes together well and builds up fairly easily into a reasonable replica of a Panther. The instructions for applying decals and the various paint options aren't particularly clear so depending on how keen you are on accuracy you can either copy the box art or do a little research& an enjoyable build."
5527,1730,5," One of Tamiya's older 1/35 scale AFV offerings but none the worse for that . Comes with a very attractive price tag compared to much of the Tamiya range but offers all the quality of moulding and detail that is a hallmark of Tamiya kits . Makes up into an attractive model straight from the box . Its modest price means & however & that experienced modellers may wish to indulge themselves with etched brass detailing & a turned brass gun barrel and individual track links for something of truly exhibition quality . Thoroughly Recommended ."
5528,1730,5," Quality kit at a very good price& wish all the Tamiya kits were this cheap. Will keep my father busy through the long winter months."
5529,1730,5," I am an avid fan of Tamiya model kits& their attention to detail is very good and the parts come off of the sprues with out any difficulty. Looks great when Finished and painted."
5530,1730,5," This makes up into quite an acceptable Panther if you ignore the technical inaccuracies and lack of fine detail.Perfect for younger modellers and people who aren't too bothered about the aforementioned inaccuracies.Bearing in mind that a top-end model of a 1:35 Panther will set you back at least three times this price& I& for one& can forgive its problems.It's a really old kit now (I remember building one of these in the seventies which shows it's age) and it was originally issued as a motorised model. In in fact the the lower hull still has the battery cradle moulded in and the hole for the on off switch. However& the parts are still crisply moulded and fit together very well. The only real problem is fitting the upper hull to the lower where you are left with a gap along the front edge.Highly recommended at this price."
5531,1731,5," Brilliant product& what a time and plastic filler saver!!!. I am in the midst of building the Tamiya Mid/late Tiger 1 at the moment and can honestly say this after market product is excellent!!!"
5532,1732,5," very pleased"
5533,1733,5," verygood"
5534,1734,5," Great fun and easy to build. Something different as well for the 28mm Italian Wars gamer."
5535,1735,5," This is a great kit for a new modeler or someone who wants a weekend |quickie| project. The fit of the parts is up to the usual Tamiya first class fit&  For the first time I used the Revell Contacta professional cement kit& this makes perfect jointing very very easy and at the price is a bargain. I will use this as a first choice in future projects. Anyone building this kit should purchase the after market kit to do the Zimmerit coating on the tank surfaces. To do it with polyester putty is messy and the finish is not good. this kit is offered on Amazon at + - 7 pounds and is well worth the result.  HAPPY MODELING."
5536,1736,5," The Whippet was designed to act as a fast and agile tank to break through enemy lines. The two bus engines gave this 14 ton beast a sprightly 8mph capability. That sounds pretty slow& but it had a 4mph advantage over the more familiar MkI/II Heavy tank.This is a relatively simple kit comprising a paltry 18 pieces. The tracks& (the bane of the tank modeller's life) are in this kit molded in solid styrene and are already |attached|*. So& this kit really couldn't be simpler to build and it went together in about 30 minutes. The fit is good and there was no need for any sanding or filling. The detail is pretty decent too& with engraved panel lines and raised rivets. These latter are a little large to my inexpert eye& but once the kit is painted they blend into the final finish quite well.There is a choice of decals - a very simple olive green scheme with either British or German markings.A rather nice little kit of a less than familiar subject.Photo link in the comments.* Pay no attention to the other review which says that the tracks come as separate black rubber. They don't"
5537,1736,5," Easily to assemble and is now ready to go on show.  The details on this model is breath taking."
5538,1736,5," Nice little& easy assembly model"
5539,1737,5," Pro - Not being too fussy or anything& but the kit is a really good price& has all the parts and the decent quality photo etching& The Seller also opens the box and puts bubble wrap around the pieces - a nice touch that I appreciated. That and discount voucher in there as well& meant a really nice experience.Cons - time taken to send from Japan. But to be honest& I am not in a rush& didn't expedite the delivery and was happy to wait. Not really a 'con' just letting you know..."
5540,1737,5," I'm very new to building models. This being the 2nd kit I've ever built so I was extremely pleased at how easy it was to build. Good detail all round and the photo etched parts are nice."
5541,1737,5," It really was a joy to build this and would recommend for the beginner some nice photo etch parts as well and a metal gun barrel that I wasn't expecting so impressed"
5542,1737,5," I LOVE BUILDING MODELS AND I KNOW I CAN OBTAIN THEM QUICKLY WHEN EVER I WANT THEM AND NO FUEL WASTED"
5543,1738,5," Amazing watercolours some new colours in the box thanks so much."
5544,1739,5," Very nice kit& with a fair amount of detail as well. I went for a distressed look in the picture below."
5545,1740,5," Similar to the 6x6 truck& this model comes together well.  Little or no flash& clear instructions builds into a cracking model."
5546,1741,5," have not finished the decals and colors yet but it is good"
5547,1742,5," very detailed and great value"
5548,1743,4," Decent model& despite the price - the only CVRT model I could find"
5549,1743,5," Very good kit& no problems."
5550,1744,5," Tamiya quality and detail& delivered nicely& well packaged."
5551,1745,5," Excellent"
5552,1746,2," Parts of this model are poorly made in ways which cannot be corrected. Holes which locate parts are not in the right position. Holes which should align for correct pin location are skewed. Finish of components is generally substandard. A good model spoiled by poor attention to detail."
5553,1746,5," I bought this for my nine year old son who loves puzzles& kits and construction toys. He spent hours working on it on his own and managed to put together most of the kit on his own. It then needed adult intervention to ensure the pistons etc turned fine but he was delighted. Incredibly good value for the independence and sense of achievement he is still getting out of it."
5554,1746,5," A lovely model once finished.  Needed a lot of adult assistance&  Not really suitable for children to attempt on their own"
5555,1746,5," So I received this model along with the battery pack. The instructions are very good& full colour (the battery pack instructions are awful btw.. tiny writing & impossible to read).This was my first Timberkits effort and an enjoyable two days making it (probably about 6+ hours work).Definitely not for young children as a lot of care and attention is needed when glueing& make a mistake and you can't go back and change it - as I realised when I glued the handle down& only to find that I could no longer connect up the battery pack!.I would say that there were a couple of parts which seem to not have been correctly made. In particular the chimney funnel& the holes were way off and I had to improvise by not using the peg in the top but just glueing the struts to the sides of the chimney.Also be warned there are no spare parts! none at all!So if you are careful& read the instructions several times before glueing& pay close attention to details then you will enjoy this.I am now going to purchase the vintage car!"
5556,1746,5," I bought the kit as a Xmas present for my husband. It arrived on time& was very well packeged and gave hours of enjoyment. The kit was beautifully made and its great to give a British made gift....will buy another for a birthday gift."
5557,1746,5," Got this for my husband as a gift.  He loved it and has nearly finished making it.  There are a huge number of pieces to put together but it doesn't seem to be difficult.  So far there are none of those |extra| or |missing|bits that don't make sense and he has not had to redo any of it.  The mechanical action seems nice and smooth and it is good to look at - worth the rather steep price."
5558,1746,5," This was a challenge and took a while to complete& its different from some models insomuch as all the parts are machined and not in |press out| flat sheets thus its best to take your time otherwise mistakes will be made.One criticism the hole to roller which drives the rear wheels  was only central at one end and off centre at the other by quite a bit& I had noticed it during construction but for some reason thought nothing of it - ended up removing it and replacing with one I had to make.Grandson loves it"
5559,1746,5," Considering the complexity of this kit& the instructions were quite easy to follow and resulted in a very pleasing model. I would certainly recomend this kit to anyone with an eye for detail."
5560,1747,5," a beautiful kit& full interior and will look good in all modelers collection. the thing that might put some people of is it has rubber wheels& but to bothered myself."
5561,1748,5," A super kit of this late WW2 British tank which is a delight to build . Has all the expected quality of a Tamiya AFV kit and very straightforward to build . Easily superdetailed into a really stunning model ."
5562,1748,5," very nice kit"
5563,1748,5," very good"
5564,1749,5," I am one of those people who dabled with kits as a kit but tended to produce gluey messes. This year after a 3 decade break a colleague inspired me to get back into it.This was the first tracked kit I attempted. It is still a work in progress but has been an absolute joy. Each step has been a pleasure and it is developing into something pretty good.Good Tamiya quality."
5565,1749,5," Another highly detailed kit from Tamiya of this classic German half track.The highly detailed interior with large radio"
5566,1750,5," arrived as stated"
5567,1751,5," Another stunning quality kit from tamiya"
5568,1751,5," Great Model."
5569,1752,5," Very good arrived early quite impressed no damage"
5570,1752,5," Very quick response. Good value"
5571,1753,5," My Christmas present looking forward to making it"
5572,1754,4," A quality kit - good proportions& nice detailing and a simple build. Great value& too.There are some minor quibbles:- The commander's hatch is hard to fit convincingly as it has no tabs to locate it.- The tracks lack detail.- Some deck cargo beyond the spare wheels would have been nice. All the photos I've seen show them with tools& cables and spare track links stacked all over.However& these are minor details and I like the end result very much."
5573,1755,5," good price just what i wanted"
5574,1755,4," This was a gift although I've bought Academy before and they're pretty good. I'm awaiting some feedback before I can say more."
5575,1756,5," Excellent model and arrived very quickly. Highly recommended"
5576,1757,5," Dispatched quickly and just as advertisedâ€¦a brand new model kit in a sealed box. Excellent!!"
5577,1758,5," very good and cool looking kit& not very difficult to put together& lovely to look at next to its 1:35 brother of the same model."
5578,1759,5," Aaa"
5579,1760,5," Love it"
5580,1761,5," Great& a big kit and lots on pieces. Barley any flash and lots of photo-etch. Lots of detail and takes a long time to build. Fast shipping times and overall I'm happy with the quality of the product and service"
5581,1762,5," Wanted to build my own 1/16th scale tank from start to finish and this at only Â£69 was great to do it.Tamiya are fantastic but at above Â£500 I couldn't justify that.Really good instructions in English and easy to follow.There are a few tricky bits but you soon sort them out.Would I buy another ??? Yes I would.Ordered on Saturday evening delivered Monday great service"
5582,1762,5," OK. So this is not as good as Tamiya's offering& but when you consider the massive price difference things really do fall into place. This builds into an impressive model of the infamous Tiger tank and in this scale it certainly does give you an impression of the impressive strength and power this awesome vehicle did project.Detail may be slightly lacking when compared to Tamiyas but only very slightly& the mouldings are crisp and more than accurate enough for someone who is not an absolute detail head.I have been building models for over 40 years and and have lost count on how many Tigers I have built in that period of time butas one reviewer here has already asked& would I buy another one? The answer is a resounding YES as I already have for another project that I am working on..In plain and simple terms this is a kit I would recommend without hesitation"
5583,1762,5," read reviews on line about this product and it meets all expectations it is a large scale kit for small scale price with plenty of scope for upgrade parts and scratch build improvementsall in all very good"
5584,1762,5," It was what I expected and turned up when the company said it would. Can't exepct more than that .Plus the kit is an absolute peach -- can't wait to get stuck in"
5585,1762,5," great kit if you like making tanks.love to see more large kits like this.great detail.great kit a joy to make."
5586,1762,5," Not made it yet but looks tremendous 'in bits'. Its going to be a monster when complete.  I'm used to 1/35 stuff and the size of this is frightening.  Some serious research on camouflage schemes is needed now.I'm going in....!"
5587,1763,5," The moulds are exactly the same as those used for the Italerai model of the 109 inch Land Rover. But& as the cost is somewhat lower& I can forgive Revell on this occasion. The kit builds very well and gives a good finished item. There isn't a lot of flashing to worry about on the sprues and& as long as full attention is given to the instruction sheet& this will produce a very good finished kit.Based on the lower cost alone& I would recommend this kit to anyone who wants a larger scale version than the 1:48 scale available from Airfix.The supplier was very fast in posting the item out to me. It arrive well packaged and in very good time."
5588,1763,4," Nice little weekend filler. An old but sturdy model. And you can't beat the price."
5589,1764,4," A very detailed kit with a well filled box of parts. This is a quite complex kit to build and I would recommend dry fitting parts where ever possible& prior to gluing& as the instructions are not very clear in some areas making errors quite likely. There are also some minor errors in a couple of the fitting diagrams& hence the need to fit first and glue later. A bit of a drawback with this kit is the large number of small plastic nodules which adorn even the smallest parts. Even with careful cutting& a fair bit of filing is required to remove traces of all these nodules. Painting instructions are sparse. Just various colour schemes for the overall model and no colours for internal details. Despite a few minor niggles& I am enjoying building this kit and have some way to go before completion."
5590,1764,4," Very good thanks."
5591,1765,4," I have always preferred Tamiya as a manufacture of choice when it comes to military vehicles. The pastic is of a better quality thansome and the parts size is not ususally so small and fiddley that construction is more difficult than it needs be."
5592,1765,5," Very satisfying model to make and paint"
5593,1765,5," Really good kit& even without any 3rd party add-ons."
5594,1765,5," Really pleased with this and came in quick time &detail looks amazing can't wait to build and paint this"
5595,1765,5," great value for money"
5596,1766,4," good model"
5597,1767,5," Got model on time looks like its going to be a great build loads of pieces excellent detailing no flashing cant wait to make a start"
5598,1767,5," This is real T-90 only in 1/35 scale. You will not find anything better than that. 1400 parts will keep you occupied for some time."
5599,1768,4," Most of the time Italieri manufactures a good quality model. This is not an exception. The parts are well cast with good detail. The tank has zimmerit coating. Unfortunately& that interoperability of some main components could be better& but after a minor adjustment everything sits in place nicely. The instructions are well presented& but not very clear. Especially there is uncertainty with some small parts fitting places and directions and further research on the internet must be done. I got across that one list shows parts fitted one direction& and on the other& another direction. This just adds to the fun as the correct path can be found easily. When completed& the model looks realistic and this is the main thing."
5600,1769,4," Good clean moulding.  It is correct that no glue is required though I would finish off with liquid glue using a fine brush.  Detail good.  Tank body is 60mm long so compatible with 15mm scale models.  The ad may say 1/72nd but its not.  Its a 1/100 scale model (the 1/72nd model needs to be 80mm long in the body).  Easy to assemble for adult or teenager.  Not really suitable for children.  Turret turns when complete.  If you want a 15mm Mk IV tank then Tiger Hobbies sell it at a good price."
5601,1770,4," Nice model& decently priced& delivered as promised& no problems."
5602,1771,5," Old Matchbox kit kept in production by Revell and for longer than most of them. So a classic enduring kit and at a very moderate price. Like the other Matchbox Revell kits it is cheap and easy to build with a decent level of detail& certainly for the price. Also the Matchbox Revell feature (not found in recent Revell modeks) of a bit of battle diorama and a couple of figures. Late model of Panzer II& which served largely in a reconnaissance function by this time after earlier service as light battlefield tank. Not one of the best Panzer designs& but had a significant role in the earlier part of the war. This a great classic kit& suitable for beginners and those who want a modelling collection that includes some of the older designs. Not many Panzer II models available at present& though options for early WWII armour are improving. So an essential buy for WWII German tank modellers in this scale& particularly good of beginners and those who want to cover earlier war models in their collection. Great value for money."
5603,1771,5," Just decided to get back into kitset models after some 20 years. Decided to pick up these small Revell kits which are revamps of the old Matchbox kits to get started. (Chiefly because they have their own diorama base). The kits have good detail for this scale& well moulded and really for the price couldn't go wrong."
5604,1771,5," A very well detailed kit& 1:76 scale so small parts to contend with& but with figures and diorama it is an excellent buy."
5605,1771,5," Really nice kit& everything went together well. Its a Revell skill level 3 kit& but I didn't find it too hard."
5606,1772,4," Have been waiting YEARS for this particular tank to appear. Well happy. Suggest you shop around a bit& though. This one came from Asia... and the price reflects it."
5607,1773,5," Great fun to build and paint - an excellent model - so Owen has made a video about building it!!https:"
5608,1774,5," Really nice model."
5609,1774,5," V nice kit"
5610,1775,5," first class kit for my Tamiya 1/25 collection& one question though why didn't Tamiya ever do a SHERMAN in 1/25? probably the most prolific tank ever  I&think  it is worthy. THANKS"
5611,1776,5," Expensive& but worth every penny. Very similar to the other trump T34's with scope to make a fantastic looking kit.Just in case anyone does not know& this is really for experienced modellers with lots of time required to do it justice.I am lucky enough to own 2 other trumpeter 1/16  T34's and the M16 half track and all of them are highly recommended."
5612,1777,5," Makes up into an impressive model & if assembled with care & and begs the experienced modeller to apply superdetailing skills to enhance it even further  . A kit now at least forty years old & it stands comparision with more modern products quite well . Italeri & in the 1970s were the equal of Tamiya in terms of detail even if the plastic they employed seemed just a touch more brittle . This is a kit I have twice enjoyed building and can thoroughly recommend ."
5613,1777,5," Great kit great price what's not to like"
5614,1777,5," looks good"
5615,1777,5," Gr8"
5616,1778,5," Perfect models for 1/72 wargaming. Nice models with about the right balance between detail and robustness. The suspension is a bit fiddly - it is possible to put it on backwards - I did. An inexpensive way of adding a KV Company to my Rapid Fire Army."
5617,1779,5," Everything included with another beautifully detailed Tamiya kit& looks like it will make a very nice model when completed."
5618,1779,5," just what I wanted"
5619,1780,4," 2nd Pegasus purchase and quite pleased with the results. Easy to assemble and good level of detail. No flash and all parts fit well. Good potential for conversions."
5620,1780,5," Good stuff made by Pegasus buy it!"
5621,1781,5," Model Kasten have a reputation for quality hard plastic tracks. If they were cast in white metal they'd give Fruilmodel a run for their money. Then again there IS the difference between Â£8-Â£9 for MK"
5622,1782,5," loved making this one. i had one when i was a kid so many years ago. brought back great memories. fantastic detail."
5623,1782,5," This is another brilliant model produced by Tamiya and the 1/35 scale shows very good detail. I am retired and make these models for my grandson& who loves them."
5624,1782,5," The money is worth this good. I find the price in retailer shop is nearly 20 pounds. The quality is very good."
5625,1782,5," Thanks"
5626,1783,5," What can i say meng models outstanding the dogs wotsits"
5627,1784,4," Very good kit with usual Tamiya quality and an original subject too.Recommended for all modelers who search quality and originality."
5628,1784,5," Very nice kit great great service"
5629,1784,5," Awesome"
5630,1785,5," Looks like an absolutely stunning kit (yet to start building it). Lots of detail and very comprehensive and detailed instructions. My only quibble with it is that it lacks the engine that the other T-90 by MENG Models has."
5631,1785,5," Haven't built it yet but looks really good."
5632,1786,5," An excellent kit. This is a Tamiya re-box of the ICM kit with some added extras and Tamiya instructions that make it a worthwhile purchase."
5633,1787,5," Spot on"
5634,1788,5," Superb kit best I have ever built."
5635,1789,5," excellent thank you"
5636,1790,5," Very good"
5637,1791,5," A fairly simple kit with Tamiya's usual nice detailing and moulding standards& the kit itself is not too taxing& being fairly simple to build& but allows plenty of scope for modification (which is why I bought it). Arrived within the stated time and was very well wrapped and protected for transit. A nice simple kit as a stand alone piece or as an addition to a scale diorama (which is again why I bought it). Would also make a great stocking filler for the price."
5638,1792,3," No decals& no instructions just an exploded diagram. Few parts weren't even on the diagram. I didn't really expect much for a fiver for two tanks& so its OK."
5639,1792,4," A simple kit& consisting of only one sprue per model. There are no instructions& just an exploded diagram on the back of the box& which doesn't correspond 100% with the parts *in* the box. The instructions seem to indicate that there are locating pins in some locations where there aren't any in reality. This shouldn't cause any major problems for a reasonably experienced modeller but could put beginners off a bit. There are no decals included but these can be easily sourced. The models turn out smaller than I had expected (about 3 inches or so long) but the detail is pretty good and could be enhanced with some decent painting and weathering. Given that you get two models in one box& these are good value for money and fun to make& and I'd definitely buy more."
5640,1792,5," Nice looking model and easy to put together. A good looking addition to my collection. Worth while considering at a reasonable price."
5641,1792,4," Fine"
5642,1793,5," delivered on time a great kit of this unusual weapons system not for the novice as quite complicated but well worth the effort"
5643,1793,4," good"
5644,1794,5," grate thanks"
5645,1795,5," Excellent usual Tamiya model& given its age."
5646,1796,5," This is a nice model kit& especially considering its price.The kit was fun to build although some parts were quite challenging to assemble& so I would not recommend this product to someone who has never built a tank before& but for someone of a medium skill level it would be great.Instructions were quite clear and easy to follow& but it is always a good idea to read ahead as some parts are not as clear as they could beThis kit is quite similar to other Italeri Crusader kits and has some part commonalitythe kit includes:the kit itselfdecal sheetinstructions3 painting options are given on the instructions& and as far as I can tell they are reasonably accuratethe model itself is quite well detailed and features traversing turret and gunI can't fault this kit& although it is not the most detailed out there& it is on par with an equivalent Tamiya (Tamiya being mid-range ish) kit for the same price"
5647,1797,5," As advertised"
5648,1797,5," very good"
5649,1798,5," Original trumpeter kit with options for 5 crew and an interior front cab& the plastic is ok& not the greatest grade but will make for an interesting build.The delivery was quicker than advertised a big thanks to the seller for that.."
5650,1799,5," Dispatched quickly and just as advertisedâ€¦a brand new model kit in a sealed box. Excellent!!"
5651,1800,5," Great little models especially for someone like me who refuses  to grow up."
5652,1800,5," very nice."
5653,1800,5," Good model"
5654,1801,4," Three good models in one box&  some of the smaller parts a bit fidely especially  if you have big fingers like me  but went together ok"
5655,1802,5," Very detailed kit with good instructions. Only let down is the lack of engine that the other T-90 by MENG has. LED lights are a real bonus. Looking forward to getting this on the bench in the coming months."
5656,1802,5," What an awesome kit recomend it to anyone delivered in a sturdy box and quickly"
5657,1803,5," Excellent kit. Very well made.Tamya kits are in my opinion the best kits today. The detail on them is excellent and theres very little flashing."
5658,1803,5," BRILLIANT and realistic model. Also very easy to put together! :)"
5659,1803,5," excelent model crisp detail parts fit together well no complaints"
5660,1803,5," goods deliveredgood tamiya product"
5661,1804,5," I started building this model in 2007 can you believe. I moved house shortly before the final constructional elements were put together and final weathering was commenced. After settling down into a life routine I decided to continue with building again and found this half completed tank in the stocks& so I have just today decided to resurrect her and give her a fitting finish with the rest of the tanks on the shelves.The kit is a basic one really& the original version was motorised& the battery markings and power switch holes are still in there but the motor and parts are not included any more. The kit is the usual thick quality plastic from Tamiya and fit together well. The upper ans lower hull clip together& I guess as an easy method of removing the batteries& so there is a gap in the front armour that will need filling by the more perfectionist modeller. The detail on the hull is a super with hand rails& hooks& tool cases and tools in place& there are separate stowage boxes that are glued on and twin fuel drums on the rear armour. The turret features two opening hatchways& one with a anti aircraft machine gun fitting& there is also a commander figure that can be placed in the turret if you so wish a figure to be seen. The 10 wheels& two idlers and two sprockets are attached by rubber grommet fixings and rotate which makes it easy for the rubber band tracks to be threaded into place.The tracks are of decent quality for single length& fit well enough and attach to each other well& a little super glue will fix them enough as they will not be in motion so to speak. The sprocket wheels are a little awkward in fitting to the tracks but they do the job with some pushing and fiddling.Read more â€º"
5662,1804,5," As with all Tamiya kits& they are the upper side of quality and engineering. Better than a Revell or Airfix& but not as detailed as a Dragon or a Trumpeter.What I like about Tamiya is that they are usually quite simply engineered in terms of parts& and the fit of the said parts is usually if always spot on. No needs for excessive filler or reshaping. This tank is no exception. No major problems were found with construction an the whole thing went together well. Some decal setting fluid will be needed as the decals can silver& and I would recommend aftermarket tracks as the ones that are supplied are a little stiff and ridged.ON the whole& a great buy."
5663,1804,5," Brilliant tank! Bought this as my first ever 1/35 scale tank and I don't regret anything! Everything went together smoothly and there was hardly any flash on the parts at all& if there was any I didn't see it. I recommend this kit for anyone who builds models or anyone who is starting out and it's cheap so that's a great bonus too& earned its 5 stars."
5664,1804,5," The package came approximately 1 week after purchase. Constructing the model was a joy. I will definitely purchase another one in the near future."
5665,1804,5," It was a joy to build this and as always from tamiya the detail was just amazing &would highly recommend it for any modellers"
5666,1805,5," Very happy with it"
5667,1806,5," I have to admit& I bought this kit by accident as I thought it was the same 1:35 scale tank that I built many years ago and enjoyed very much. But as I build both scales I decided to keep it and open it up to see how bad it was as many of my experiences with 1:72 armour has been a little on the dire side.My worries where soothed when I opened the box and read the instructions. For a 1:72& there is by the looks of it just as much detail as their 1:35 scale offerings. The suspension columns are in two pieces with the horizontal arm and roller moulded in place but the twin wheels look as if they fit into the pins in the arm so they can rotate. The drive sprocket is two piece and not sure if it has to be glues or it can rotate& but it would be a shame if it does not as the main wheels can. One great thing I have not seen in any scale kit of a tracked vehicle before is two sets of tracks! One set of rubber band types and one set of rigid strips for the top and bottom with separate links for the curvature around the drive sprocket and rear wheel. I am really pleased to see this as it gives you the choice and even gives you a set of spares for another 1:72 Sherman.Next comes the 8 piece engine& drive shaft and gearbox& excellent detail for a smaller scale. Then comes the hull with hatches& tools& engine cover and rear shelf with items for stowage. The turret is next up with the gun and mantlet assembly comprising of 6 parts& 4 Separate hatches and AA machine gun next go onto a two piece hull& the bottom ring fixing to the upper hull.There are three different versions to make with decals supplied for each.Read more â€º"
5668,1807,4," Service good...product nearly as good& shame for a Tamiya kit"
5669,1808,5," They don't cone much better then this kit from meng"
5670,1808,5," bought as a present"
5671,1809,5," Excellent"
5672,1810,5," Very nice model. Very enjoyable to build and finished model came out really nice. Well i think so."
5673,1810,5," As usual from tamiya& good quality& good instructions and no excessive flash on the detailed components."
5674,1810,5," excellent"
5675,1811,5," Quite a good kit. loads of detail for the guns. It also comes with magic tracks that require cutting& trimming and gluing& very time consuming but they have to be the best tracks iv seen come standard with a kit."
5676,1812,5," All parts fit together perfectly& clear instructions& NO FLASH at all on parts and very detailed and very cheap. Around 490 pieces all in all :)"
5677,1812,5," I am a military modeler. Have attempted to use Zvezda product before& did not like what I had to work with. Found an internet review on this model& gave them another chance - bingo - better presentation and quality of product in the box"
5678,1812,5," just arrived. This looks great 451 parts a lot of them small& Detail is brilliant. The turret alone is 18 steps to build 199 parts. This is not recommended for the beginner. So i might try a couple different ones before building this.Or i might just jump in.Could not see any flash on the model parts& so all good there. You will need to take your time with this one. Seen photo's and vids of this tank built and it looks great once done."
5679,1813,5," Excellent interior extras."
5680,1814,5," I really nice model that I have used for a conversion of Dust Tactics. The model was very well packaged and is a very detailed kit. I was also taken a back by the a very pleasant note from the seller thanking me for the purchase."
5681,1815,5," I'm not going to comment of the historical accuracy of the model& I'll have to assume its right or there abouts.The model is a really easy kit that just snaps together& and as my son proved numerous times& it also comes to bits and goes back together again."
5682,1816,5," nice littla model"
5683,1817,5," Just finished making this kit up. Well worth the money& instruction are easy to follow. I find Hobby Boss kit very good value - they cover a large range of kits."
5684,1818,4," As usual with Tamiya the kit goes together really well. Detail is generally good without the model being |over engineered|. This makes it easy and straightforward to build.However as an open topped vehicle I found a lack of detail in the shell storage racks. I scratch built the straps to hold the shells in place using metal foil from a wine bottle. No shells are provided for the racks and Tamiya brass ones don't fit. I had to adapt plastic shells.The tracks are one piece vinyl and have adequate detail but it is difficult to get realistic track sag as the vehicle has only one return roller.The above being said this is a good& easy built and reasonably priced model of a common German WW2 SP."
5685,1818,5," delivered on time a straight forward kit that goes together with ease with good detail all over"
5686,1818,5," Amazing detail from tamiya would definitely recommend"
5687,1819,5," One of the two versions (early/late models) of the Water Buffalo that AFV Club produce. My first reaction on opening the box was& |Dear God& that's a lot of parts|... my second being& |Oooh& niiice|. As with all AFV Club kits I've bought this is not a swift weekend build& not if you want to do it justice. I also have Itaeleri's VERY old molding and the two kits are as alike as cheese"
5688,1820,5," I'm a life long tank nut and build loads of kits. Tamiya's Leopard A4 is exactly the sort of therapy I needed after some epic struggles with recent purchases from other manufacturers. I do like a challenge but was getting heartily sick of things not fitting and excessive flash to clean up on the cheaper kits and ludicrous complexity and needlessly high parts-count with the more expensive ones.The Leopard went together faultlessly in a weekend. Tamiya mouldings are always crisp and clean (no flash) and this is no exception. The instructions are crystal clear& the construction sequence is logical and feasible.....you'd be suprised....and even the rubber-band tracks look the part. Poor tracks let down so many tank models - no need to resort to after market track-link sets here for any one except hardcore rivet-counters.The kit IS thirty four years old now (1979 moulded on the lower hull) and thus not 'state of the art' but it was a breeze to build and looks a hell of lot like the real ones I saw zooming around the arena at Bovington Tank Museum last summer. Just what the doctor ordered. Now& where's that Dragon Models Tiger 1?"
5689,1820,5," Excellent model  no problems would recommend it"
5690,1820,4," Not a bad kit - I found it a bit easy. Good plastic construction. It did not seem as good as other Tamiya tank plastic kits."
5691,1820,5," Another excellent Tamiya kit"
5692,1820,5," Gr8"
5693,1821,5," another really nice kit not to complicated like some of the newer kit makers guns and canonns that are about that are a bit to fiddellyand fall apart when you dry brush them."
5694,1821,5," Lots of detail and fun to build a joy as always from tamiya"
5695,1822,3," Not bad but the machine gun is not included. Overall it builts into a handsome kits. Love the idea that it comes in two."
5696,1822,5," husband loves its"
5697,1823,5," excellent model& very easy to make and looks great when complete. The size of the tank and figures was bigger than expected but that made construction much easier. the tank came with six figures including two bonus ones& when completed and painted the overall effect is impressive. would highly recommend particularly for those new to modelling tanks."
5698,1823,5," Excellent kit which makes up into an impressive Churchill tank . Has all the quality of moulding that is expected from Tamiya . Straightforward to build & a few superdetailing touches and it is easy to produce a model of exhibition quality ."
5699,1823,5," Great model preety simple to build and looks great just a shame you dont get optional plastic tracks but tamiya rearly do."
5700,1823,5," Arrived earlier than estimated date so very pleased on that front. I've built many of the 1/35 Tamiya armour kits and this one seems no exception so far to the excellent build quality - everything fits together nicely and the detailing is of an impressive standard. Great kit for the price."
5701,1823,5," the tank is a very lovely model in my display"
5702,1823,5," Good value for money and good product"
5703,1823,5," Just started building this today got as far as the base of the tank it seems a lot bigger than other 1:35 model tanks looks a nice model"
5704,1823,5," Fantastic Tamiya kit"
5705,1824,5," As with all Tamiya kits this is a highly detailed representation of this classic W.W.2 German S.P.G.I really like the detachable side armour plates& the concrete block driver's compartment extra protection"
5706,1824,5," great model at a great price. hadn't built any plastic models since i was a teenager (20 years ago!) and decided to get back into building models as a way to relax. Previously I'd built 1:72 fighter jets& so this was a little different& but i managed it easily - took about 4-5 hours in total.It's fairly simple to build& but i would suggest getting some tools to help your construction - hobby knife& sand paper etc and there's plenty of online tutorials regarding building models. So i'd rate this as a great starter modelMy next step is to get some paint and paint it...."
5707,1824,5," When you see the name Tamiya in models there is nothing else to say it is well packed the instructions are clear and the model is well molded 100/100 every time"
5708,1824,4," My Grandson found the Tamiya - German Sturmgesshustz 1V Tank (1:35 Scale Militry Model) fairly easy to make and from his comments I would recommend this product to any one wishing to bur a present for 8- 12 year old.The service from AMAZON - delievery was very good- Quick."
5709,1824,5," Very nice kit from Tamiya that makes up into an excellent model of a tankhunter variant of the Panzer IV . This particular kit is one of Tamiyas older offerings but is nonetheworse for that as it incorporates all the quality of moulding and detail that is Tamiyas hallmark . A well thought out kit it makes into a convincing model with just a little superdetailing and some weathering in its finish ."
5710,1824,5," Typical Tamiya. An old model but nice either as a base to mod into different varients. These were the most common of WWII German army tanks& by far the most numerous in the inventory and one of the most combat effective units. Surprisingly given the numbers of them produced one of the least common survivors.A worthwhile addition to anyone's armour collection."
5711,1824,4," good solid kit got two to make an arnhem diorama straightforward build added my own zimmermit and foliage new aerials etc overall good value."
5712,1825,5," Can't wait to start building this looks amazing and received it in quick time to and well packed so I'm happy :) five starts *****"
5713,1826,5," 32520 1/48 GERMAN PANTHERFrom opening the box& you have the usual Tamiya instruction sheet& carefully laid out in short sections and so easy to follow. The metal one-piece hull has a nice weight to it& so the model isn't too light for this medium scale. All options for the 'G' model are reproduced& two different sorts of mantlet& the flame proof exhausts of the later 'G'& side skirts and the cabin heater duct over the engine deck and markings for four different units. The track is of the built up variety and fit excellently. The casting on the model is sharp& so none of the detail is lost& it's just as sharp as the larger 1/35th. Budget and space considerations make this an excellent scale to have a fine collection of tanks& lets hope manufacturers expand this range considerably. To sum up& big on detail and small on space!"
5714,1827,4," Lovely kit& very impressed"
5715,1827,5," Excellent"
5716,1827,4," Great"
5717,1828,5," Very nice moldings including cameras/type-writer etc. that I wish I'd had ten years ago (had an urge to 'build' Alan Whicker when he served in Italy..). Also includes a decal sheet with shoulder flashes& stripes etc. Very good investment for them that likes something a little 'different' in their dioramas... the gentleman with the type-writer would look excellent in a dug-out in Arnhem."
5718,1829,5," Fantastic kit& extremely well detailed& interesting and unusual subject matter.  There are plenty of options within the instructions and the kit can be assembled with the sides up or down& winter tracks& etc.  100%"
5719,1830,5," The FW190 Wurger (Shrike or Butcher Bird) was designed by Kurt Tank during the 1930's and entered service with the Luftwaffe in late 1941. Powered by a radial BMW 801 engine it was concieved as a supplement to the Bf109 but soon proved itself to be a formidable fighter in its own right. It served in many other roles& as ground-attack and fighter-bomber and even as a |Wilde Sau| night-fighter and was flown by many of the Luftwaffe's aces& such as Heinz Bar& Otto Kittel& Ehrich Rudorffer and Walter Nowotny.EasyModel manufacture a seemingly endless line of military models"
5720,1830,5," worth having in your collection  great detail of a rare  fighter"
5721,1831,5," Excellent kit. Good value with 2 vehicles per box. Excellent detail (much better than Armourfast) and fits together well. Obviously not as good as a more complex kit& but ideal for wargaming and they still look great when completed."
5722,1831,5," good"
5723,1832,5," This kit is really superb. Exceptionally well moulded and designed in its construction& it's a joy to build. Use a liquid glue and the choice of either Afrika Korps or European theatre decals make for a really enjoyable modelling experience."
5724,1832,5," Quality kit at a very good price& wish all the Tamiya kits were this cheap. Will keep my father busy through the long winter months."
5725,1832,5," Brilliant detail and am looking forward to putting it with my other displays.im sure it will fit in with the rest"
5726,1832,5," Great product as usual from Tamiya& wheels and track both articulate (provided you glued them properly)& as well as the rear door hatch has articulating hinges. Price is well worth it& and it would make a good starter kit (provided you have the tools and glue required)& although I'd argue any Tamiya 1/35 ground vehicle (not aircraft& they have less leniency with fit) would make a good starting point.Just a tip& there are some blank square pieces of plastic that come that aren't used for anything. You can use them as bases for the infantry soldiers to stop them from tipping over so easily& and can be adorned with fake grass& spare ammo cans& etc. Or you can just use some blue tac in order to fix them in place and prevent them from falling& which is what I did with the soldier climbing over the half-track's sidewall& as he was a little bit unbalanced (probably how I glued his arms& slightly the wrong angle)& but a dab of blue tac has kept him in the same place for months now."
5727,1832,5," An old tamiya kit but still a good buy goes together really well and builds into a nice looking model"
5728,1832,5," I know this was an old tamiya kit but I used to have this and built it years ago so I have just got back into my hobby again and wanted to build this particular kit and it was a joy to build not a good as detail as some more recent kits but still enjoyed myself putting it together so would recommend"
5729,1832,5," Can't wait to build this old kit still looks great. Good detail crisp sprues 5 troops great price"
5730,1832,5," Sheer quality from Tamiya& Figures could be better but this kit was out originally in the 1970's"
5731,1833,5," Looks excellent"
5732,1834,4," This ia a very nice little kit& detale is crisp as allways from Tamya& the limited detail is fine for the scale."
5733,1835,5," I bought this for a diorama based on the Normandy tank battles with a Panzer IIV also from Tamiya and it is a great kit. The parts fit together really nicely and it comes with a crew of 4 all have good detail and the finished model looks really cool. Painted with acrylics thinned with water and a drop of washing up liquid and my airbrush.Another great kit from Tamiya and reasonably priced as well."
5734,1835,5," good well made product some parts are fiddly but good value..."
5735,1836,4," Good but whud say for the more experts modeler."
5736,1837,5," Fantastic quality very good price can't wait to use it on my layout and very quick delivery will be back to get more"
5737,1838,4," A bit disappointed there was no fishing rod but otherwise good"
5738,1838,4," I like it but no fishing rod !!!! It is shown in the photo."
5739,1838,5," Goood detail & well done"
5740,1838,5," EX ITEM"
5741,1839,5," This is excellent quality and incredible attention to detail and looks marvellous at the side of the road on our train layout."
5742,1840,5," As always with Preiser figures& the level of detail is superb- far more than I would have expected for figures that are primarily intended as a form of background to a railway layout. They are precisely what I need for my purposes. The only negative comment I would make (and this may not matter to other purchasers) is that there are some duplicate figures included in this set- other than that I cannot fault this item."
5743,1841,5," We bought the Verger for our Grandsons Church&the figure is highly detailed with gold goblet&as if the Verger has Holy water inside.a nice touch to go with the other Church figures he as."
5744,1841,5," Yet again a highly decorated piece&ideal to go with the Verger carrying the Cross& two nice pieces.Very pleased.THANK YOU."
5745,1842,3," This is a very difficult item to actually mark up. The kit itself is not at all good in its unmade state. You have to cut the sections out with a craft knife& which in itself is not too bad& however the sections do not have tabs that allow you to glue them together. each section of wall comes in two parts& front and rear& which need to be glued together and that is where the lack of tabs become a problem.Having said that once you overcome the gluing and the bad fit& it is not too much trouble to add scenic railway grass and earth along with stones and other scale items to add some sort of realism. This is the second of these models I have built and a third is waiting so you can see that I have not been put off by the 'problems'. I have used this diorama as a backdrop for a WW1 tank scene and will be adding WW1 soldiers to the scxene which is attached."
5746,1842,5," An excellent scenic base for creating a diorama.  Normally these type of bases are used in WW2-themed projects& with a vehicle and troops& but for this one I used the excellent Tamiya Farm Animals kit to create a scene featuring just the animals.Both sides of the building are detailed& so it can be viewed from any angle.  It's made from thin styrene-based plastic which is sturdy and easy to work with."
5747,1843,5," Great play table for my son. Contains his play time messes well. Raised edges stops any cars/trains from being forced off the edges at our feet& and we can store boxes with the toys underneath.Love it. Even by brother wants one for his kids& so I guess I'll be buying another!"
5748,1843,5," Ideal present for my grandson on his birthday."
5749,1844,5," Preiser 1/72 scale German Pak Crew. Very highly detailed and a must for discerning modellers."
5750,1845,5," |Once again& use these for Macro photography. I have had these daredevils sking through ice cream block ravines& down emmenthal cheese slopes& through whipped cream landscapes. Best of all& at the end of it& I get to eat the props.|"
5751,1845,5," Great models& using them for my art project and they put a smile on my face. Arrived relatively quick and were packaged carefully too."
5752,1846,5," very very few ho/oo figures for late autumn winter scenes& could do with a few more and city buisness persons& thankfully we do have Preiser otherwise it would have to be summer  all year round.extremely well made but they are ho and do not match with some other oo figures. exclent service from gaugemaster."
5753,1847,5," Bought this as it brought back so many happy memories.....only joking.Once again& got this item for macro photographs and it`s surprising the situations Mr Bad Guy gets up to.Well detailed and good fun.recommend."
5754,1847,5," Very good. Quick delivery"
5755,1848,5," These figures look terrific on my layout."
5756,1849,5," These little figures are perfect for the purpose of macro photography.  I was delighted with the quality of the products and have used them with great results.  Having used other small gauge figures in the past I have to say these are most precisely manufactured and far better quality than my previous choices."
5757,1850,5," Excellent product very quick turn around"
5758,1851,5," Great detail  good price  delivered on time."
5759,1852,5," great ebayer"
5760,1853,5," Excellent product for the Enthusiast."
5761,1854,5," DEalt with promptly. Great value compared to other similar products. Very nicely painted considering size of each item! REcommend to anyone."
5762,1855,5," This is an excellent HO scale diorama piece comprising of a red 4-wheel flat wagon driven by two firemen seated on it& and two horses hauling it. The wagon bears a large water barrel for use with other units of the fire brigade. The horses are walking& so we are not dashing to the scene of the fire.This is an interesting and finely-detailed model& and would be an excellent decoration for a period diorama or railway layout. There are several more units making up the full `fire brigade'& as well as a set of firemen:Preiser 30425Preiser 30427Preiser 30428Preiser 30429Preiser 12102As you would expect from Preiser& these figures are of a high quality of manufacture& detail and colouring. Note that I originally paid Â£17 for my set& so it pays to shop around in your local model shops - or even a distant one. I live in London& but find it worth travelling as far as Faversham in Kent to the Hobby Shop there for my models."
5763,1856,5," product painted beautifully and looks fantastic on my sons model railway well worth the money would recommend it to anyone"
5764,1856,5," Perfect little figures"
5765,1857,4," A typical Preiser product& on this occasion a small 1/144 scale airport figures set& I bought this to go with the Revell 747 shuttle carrier& somehow a scene involving any machines should have a human figure or two to stand next to it that way anyone viewing the model can relate to it better. The figures themselves are quite well detailed despite their small size& only half an inch high or 12 mm in metric. painting them is going to be a challenge as it will require the most steady hand really thin brushes and a magnifying glass to complete& no one said modeling was easy but when done they should compliment any display with modern jet liners without making it look like a toy."
5766,1858,5," My husband was very pleased with these models&excellent quality for the money and arrived just in time for Christmas"
5767,1859,5," Great& wife used them for a skiing themed cake. Looked good."
5768,1860,5," I haven't yet made this train but i'm hoping it'll be as good as the others. As usual excellent service from the vendor."
5769,1860,5," excellent. shame cannot find a supply of the correct matchsticksincluding manufacturer"
5770,1861,4," the model was great but there was a few problems with the instructions& wrong paint instructions"
5771,1862,4," good"
5772,1863,4," Good service medium quality"
5773,1864,5," Well painted."
5774,1865,5," The set is very detailed&there are six figures&two climbing&one pointing could be at the climbers&three ramblers.We bought the set for our Grandsons&model railway&as he is building a German based layout&lots of scenery plus rocks.We thought they would look great climbing up his model rocks&as soon as he seen them&he liked them and straight away&he knew where to arrange them&a great little set."
5775,1866,4," Good would buy again"
5776,1867,5," Very prompt service& would recommend to anyone. The product& being N gauge& has small individual items& but all painted. Fastly greater value compared to other similar products."
5777,1868,5," Bought them for a |still life| theme at my camera club - just perfectly sized and detailed"
5778,1869,5," Actually 123.6cm Picket Fencing& plus 4 gates of 1.7cm each& but who's counting!Apart from me of course.Very neat and well moulded and over all a good product& but no ground clearance when removed from sprue which makes it a little difficult when attaching to baseboard.I'm probably going to leave it brown and weather it& but I'm sure it would spray white OK.I bought this to fence off the farm buildings from my wheat field (so there's plenty left over I hear you say!)It certainly beats making it from scratch& especially when you're getting on a bit and the old eyesight's not what it was."
5779,1869,5," exelent kit"
5780,1870,5," Excellent quality and service"
5781,1871,5," Needed a rat mask quickly for school play. This arrived the day after ordering! Cheap and cheerful hard plastic mask& not the bendy rubber ones (but you have got to expect that for the price)"
5782,1872,5," This is a great quality product at a good price.Bought as a silly extra gift last Christmas& this mask is still as good as new despite making the occasional appearance at parties and the like. The elastic is still well-attached and has no visible signs of wear and tear. The same goes for the mask itself& the edges are smoothed and the print quality is excellent."
5783,1872,4," very good packaging& a little bit overpriced."
5784,1872,5," Just the job for our chef brother"
5785,1872,5," good likeness"
5786,1872,5," Brilliant"
5787,1873,5," Looked fantastic and wasn't too uncomfortable. Will keep it and am sure it will be worn again and again. Thanks"
5788,1873,5," Beautiful& elegant and fast delivery and worth the money!! My mate ordered the exact same one after she saw mine best buy thanks"
5789,1873,5," I was so happy when I received this! It looks fabby and sits very comfortably. Well made to won't just break half way through the night :)"
5790,1874,5," Oh& I really love this& if there was more stars& I'd click on them! It really made my fancy dress costume look the biz! It's really nice& headband doesn't make your ears sore and everyone wanted to try it on! I'm really impressed with this! Thanks so much!"
5791,1874,4," Wore this cat mask as part of a Halloween costume.  Very easy to wear.  Looks exactly like picture and I felt it had a far more dramatic effect than standard cats ears and whiskers."
5792,1874,5," great mask.  really well made and sturdy.  pivots mean you can move the mask to different positions until it best fits your face.  i think it is a great buy and and really pleased with it.  looking forward to wearing it for my masquerade ball and will also use it at halloween."
5793,1874,5," This is a stunning mask. It has a bit of a strange fit on the face but a bit of adjustment sorts that out.  I bought it for my friend to wear at her hen do but I may have to steal it back!"
5794,1874,5," Absolutely lovely. Well packaged and stunning piece. Wore it out for a Halloween party and got great compliments. Further into the party after a few alcoholic shots"
5795,1874,5," I loved this mask when I saw it on here& and l wasn't disappointed when it arrived two days after ordering. It does sit slightly wide on my face but that doesn't detract from it at all. It feels comfortable and I cant wait to wear it at the Halloween party next weekend!"
5796,1874,1," I wasn't overly impressed with this product. The mask is attached to a headband with the ears on. It made it so that it didn't fit well to your face so in the end I had to remove the mask and just use the ears. I ended up buying another mask."
5797,1874,5," Beautiful and very feminine - however we thought they were a two piece but the mask is fitted onto the ears but can be pushed back and worn on top of the head during the night if you wish. Would highly recommend"
5798,1875,5," Wonderful purchase. Packaged nicely. Very well made. In love with this item."
5799,1876,5," Got delivered in good time and is exactly what it said it would be."
5800,1877,4," It is a nice mask but I would say for children only& I had brought it for myself so it look too small on my face."
5801,1877,5," Bought this for world book day costume & ( cat woman) my daughter was pleased with it good value for money"
5802,1877,5," My daughter (sorry my cat) loves this. She believes she is a cat and this mask delights her. It's excellent quality and has lasted extremely well."
5803,1877,5," Ordered this for Halloween to dress as a black cat& great quality and it fitted an adult& but I do have a small head."
5804,1877,4," Good reasonably priced item& fantastic for Panto cat. Delivery swift. No problems. You get what it says on the tin."
5805,1878,2," I bought these Christmas glasses for my office Christmas party. Unfortunately I was very disappointed: they look very cheap and the actuall glass was scratched (and not a small scratch). I needed them as soon as I received them so I had to use them otherwise I would have returned them. They lights work fine though."
5806,1878,3," On of the legs was on back to front but would  have been a good sturdy product otherwise."
5807,1878,4," Good for a laugh but not for vision"
5808,1879,5," Fun item. Quick delivery."
5809,1880,4," Cheap guy Fawkes masks&good"
5810,1881,5," Brilliant. Have bought loads pf these for Christmas. Then ordered more for new year. Good for all generations& kids to grand parents - success all round!!!"
5811,1882,5," Bought these masks for my children to use for Book week at pre-school. They are really lovely& very lightweight and comfortable to wear and they fit both the children and me so we are still using them and Goldilocks has now become their favourite story.  These masks have really encouraged them to tell the story to me ~ we have had really great fun with them and the pre-school teachers thought they were brilliant.  Very pleased ~ great for dressing up and excellent for bringing favourite stories to life and my children have made quite a few new versions of this story up which have proved to be very entertaining!"
5812,1882,5," This is an excellent product& I used it with 28 reception age children. They all loved this product. It's durability is fantastic& I would definitely buy another product from you :0)Wibwibs"
5813,1882,5," Recommend these masks to anyone who is involved in storytelling with young children -they encourage participation even from normally shy or reluctant pupils"
5814,1882,5," A great product. These were much better quality than expected. Lasted over 6 weeks in s reception class role play-ready to use again!"
5815,1882,4," Good delivery and great product but foam can get ripped around holes for the elastic - the foam needs strengthening."
5816,1883,5," This is one of 15 costumes I purchased from the Christy`s costumes range on Amazon as we were arranging a fancy dress evening& we were all amazed at the fantastic quality and value for money of these costumes when they arrivedwe had all individually looked for burlesque costumes and could not find anything that suited &there was some cheap plastic looking outfits out there but nothing like the range and quality we got from the selection on line.I sincerely recommend anyone who is looking for that something different and outstanding quality and value to buy one of these costumes.absolutely 5 starlooking forward my next burlesque evening... Pauly"
5817,1884,5," ðŸ˜Š"
5818,1885,5," This is a really good quality mask which my son bought for his Christmas Ball and now is using for a decoration. One stylish and classy mask for men. Thank you !"

5820,1886,4," suited the need"
5821,1887,4," Got this for a Venician ball and it was lovely& the feather on the front came off but stuck back on no problem. It was nice that nobody else had the same one!"
5822,1888,4," Very lifelike& easy to put on& and friends liked it and had a good laugh. Works even better if you can do the voice using the words splendeed& inspir-ational& and ibsolutely barvellous. I putf it up in my front upstairs window and neighbours were quipping the Duke is staying at your house."
5823,1888,5," Quick delivery.Great customer service. The masks had a brilliant effect on the commuters getting out on the platform as we were waiting and waving at our French friends arriving in Kent for the first time."
5824,1888,5," This was a present for an aging Royalist in the Republic of Ireland. He was surprised and delighted to receive it but found it difficult to eat his Christmas dinner."
5825,1888,5," The mask proved astonishingly realistic. I could relax and adopt some of the Duke's mannerisms with great effect. Well worth the money and a treasured keepsake."
5826,1888,5," Wore this mask and Queen's mask when arriving at friends Jubilee weekend& who are Republicans - Great Fun!!  Good item and despatched promptly."
5827,1888,5," Hoping to have some fun with this on my D of E weekend with my school friends next weekend. Prompt service and very cheap!"
5828,1888,4," This is good value I wore it at our summer fete 2013 and of course it caused many a laugh&"
5829,1889,4," Its a bit flimsy and not terribly well finished but it did not cost a lot so not complaining.  It freaks me out a little but my daughter loves it and has even fell asleep wearing it"
5830,1889,5," Matched the description.  Easy and comfortable to wear - according to my 10 year old.  Dog wasn't too keen on the mask!"
5831,1889,4," Funny mask but sadly too big for a 6 yearold."
5832,1889,5," Just what I needed x"

5834,1891,5," Great buy!!"
5835,1892,5," Was a little worried about the quality of this item when I purchased it but its great&  looks good& ideal for halloween.It does need to air for a while as the silicone smell is rather strong& but thats what you would expect."
5836,1892,5," Looks really creepy on! Great product& fast delivery& just dont wear it for 8 hours like i did because i got very sweaty haha! Would recommend"
5837,1892,5," Bought for my teenage son for Halloween&he was well impressed&good quality and service.Thanks"
5838,1892,1," I throught the mask was going to be alot better for the price of it.. I think I could of got away with going pound land for this mask. Wouldn't buy again."

5845,1894,5," These were just what I hoped they would be.  They seem substantial for our drama project and should work well."
5846,1894,5," I needed these masks for an art project& they were really strong and easy to apply paint to i was happy with how they turned out when i had finished decorating them. they arrived a day before expected and were packaged well."

5848,1894,5," Nice seller. Good quality."
5849,1895,5," More then happy when I Un *boxed*  yes so no damage at all!  Great mask shape& colours good. Padding for forehead and chin.  Just akes a little on the forehead one but nothing to worry about! Great product and I Look sick."
5850,1895,5," I needed to buy one of these masks for a party that my friend was hosting& It was comfortable and I ended up wearing it for a few hours with out it bugging me! Overall a good buy and cheap too! not much else to say."
5851,1895,5," The strap is made of strong elastic and adjustable to fit all head sizes. No doubt that it is not the cheap type that you can get. It is very comfortable and sure would be very hard to break."
5852,1895,5," Love it !Really Good Quality and well worth the money& comes in a box so there is no chance in it getting damaged in the post.Would defiantly recommend buying this Mask !"
5853,1896,5," Good product I would just comments that all the faces that I ordered (26) all seemed too big for ones body but hey just a little niggle. It arrived promptly and was well packaged. Very Happy"

5856,1898,5," Great purchase and value! Mask packed with hard back cardboard and is everything you want to suprise or use as dress up."

5859,1898,5," brilliant fun"
5860,1898,5," fun"
5861,1899,5," great item thanks"
5862,1900,5," Bought this mask as a Birthday gift for my 6 year old nephew&  he couldn't get it out of the box quick enough& he wore it immediately and was releuctant to remove it& even for food!!  His posture changed when he wore the mask& he was - Darth Vadar& if the 'phrase' was critical he clasped his hands behind his back and moved his head closer to you& you knew that you were being told off - truly brilliant.  Three weeks later and it is the first thing that he plays with when he returns home from school& his Mum has also seen his dad playing with it!!  Would highly recommend."
5863,1900,4," Voice effect is good enough phrases&but could have done with a push-on-push-off button instead of having to press it each time for a single phrase."
5864,1900,5," Loved by our little boy& although it is now gathering dust at the bottom of the toy box& not a toy that really held his imagination for long"
5865,1900,5," Nice for the kids"
5866,1901,5," We found it impossible to buy this except at great expense from our local dressing up shop.  So well worth it for the smile it brought to my son's face."
5867,1901,3," This is realistic and a good fit on my 4 yr old son.  However there is no back to the mask& it is just a thick elastic band which goes  at the back of the head.  I didn't stop this on the description.  But it is fine for the dressing up box."
5868,1901,1," The Product was cheap plastic.It was already broken when arrived. I noticed one hole near the jaw area& which posed a safety threat of my son getting his finger stuck in it. Also had few white patchy marks as if used or from a discarded lot.Got full refund& but had to loose money for return postage.Most upsetting part was the disappointed look on my child when we could not give him to play after all the excitement of opening the package.I would recommend not to buy this particular product.Still searching for a better option."
5869,1901,4," Well it lasted five minutes before our son had removed the foam padding for his nose.  However& our son loves it nonetheless."
5870,1901,3," my grandson played with it once and it developed a split as he didnt want to wait for another one we kept it"
5871,1901,5," Great mask. I'd found my son a darth vader costume but alas it came without a mask.  A lot I found were very expensive& but this was just what I was looking for.  it's hard plastic and looks like it might stand up to some wear"
5872,1901,1," Nothing like the 3D image on the advert..simply a flat piece of card which will last 2 minutes for the average 5 year old. Complete rip off for Â£4-6 plus p"
5873,1901,5," My son lost his and was devastated at the prospect at not being able to be Lord Vader! It arrived early and was exactly as described. I'm very happy& my son's very happy."
5874,1902,3," Bit disappointed as when I read the description it said Full set of 5 masks and showed a picture of all 5.  Turns out its only one :-( and not the one she loves.  If I'd skipped over the part that said 'Full set' I might have thought it was only one mask.  Didn't see where it said you could choose though as all pictures are of all of them."
5875,1902,2," Not impressed at all with the description of |all 5 members|. When ordering these& albeit in a rush& I assumed that I was going to get all 5 members of the group. So only 25 masks short for a choir of 30 to perform a 1D song - oh dear."
5876,1902,5," loved these - bought for my daughters birthday partythey were great and looked like the band membersarrived on time and packed well to prevent damage in transit"
5877,1902,5," Arrived quickly and my girls love them and wore them at the One Direction concert.  I will deffinitely  shop with you again. Thanks."
5878,1902,5," great ty/"
5879,1903,5," Pleased"
5880,1904,5," Fantastic value for money"
5881,1904,4," Quick delivery and good value&  comfortable to wear& very pretty colours. Added some bows and sparkly bits and gave them to our friends"
5882,1904,5," Bought for my nephews 4th birthday party which was a superhero theme.He and all the kids loved them (as well as some of the adults) I would definitely recommend these.The price was great and delivery was fast."
5883,1904,3," Not sure what happened to my pack.  One mask had the elastic snapped in two already so it wasn't wearable and the other ones look like they are going to rip really easily.  A bit diss appointed!"
5884,1904,3," ok quality - good price - used for a children's superhero party - bought some art and crafty bits and glue and got them all to decorate their own!"
5885,1904,5," Fantastic product& kids loved it. Used it to decorate their own superheroes/princesses masks. Suitable for both boys and girls. Quick dispatch."
5886,1904,5," The Children loved them& they lasted the half term& for a couple of pound well worth it! Next year will order more!!!Quick delivery too!"
5887,1904,3," Smaller than expected and quite flimsy but they'll do the job.Arrived a day later than expected but were adequately packaged"
5888,1905,4," Was a bit more than I wanted to spend but it done the trick for a dressing up day."
5889,1905,5," Mask was brilliant!  A big hit at fancy dress party"
5890,1905,5," Sheer class. Great item& great quality& just great!"
5891,1905,5," Good  and comfort mask. Fast shipping"
5892,1905,5," Excellent"
5893,1906,5," this mask worked great for our kids X Factor show in school-very authentic and highly recommended mask!it lasted the whole evening and can be reused again."
5894,1906,4," Bought as a joke at Christmas for a Simon Cowell hater....... he thought it was very funny."
5895,1906,2," A bit disappointing& as it does not fit very well or cover the whole of your face."
5896,1906,5," Fab mask& great price& quick delivery."
5897,1907,3," As others have pointed out& you are not getting six different masks (as the photo and listing suggests)& but you'll get six masks potentially containing duplicates - I got four unique masks with two duplicates.  Not the end of the world if you know what you are getting& and for Â£3 I don't think there is much room to complain!The masks don't look like they would last too long& but again for the price about what I'd expect - and fine for a party or for one dinosaur obsessed child."
5898,1907,2," Even though the advert for these says SIX designs& you do not get six different ones. We got four different& with two duplicates."
5899,1907,5," These are just as I expected and ideal for the little ones. My grandson is 2 and loves all things dinosaur so was very happy indeed as were his little friends. Good value and no complaints."
5900,1907,5," I was impressed with the speed of the order placement and shipping. Unfortunately& my order got lost somewhere with the Royal Mail. As these were party bag favours for my son's 3rd birthday& I emailed Blue Frog Toys with our predicament. Andy got back to me and sent out another shipment straightaway& 3 days before the party. On the day of the party& I still hadn't seen the the package& but then my husband found it tucked behind our bins. Andy saved our little guy's dinosaur birthday party! Thanks for the excellent customer service!"
5901,1907,4," These masks were bought for a toy sale project my little boy was doing& and everyone who bought them (mums and children) were happy with the quality.  The detail on the mask is very clear and the colours vibrant.  The elastic to keep the mask on sits comfortable on long and short hair (girls/boys). The children enjoyed playing imaginary dinosaur games and a lot of parents asked where I purchased them from.  I personally highly recommend these especially for parties& nice quality."
5902,1907,4," These have been bought as a stocking filler for a 5 year old who is made about dinosaurs.  I can't remember whether the designs are the same as those shown - but there are 6 different masks - all brightly coloured.  They are made out of a thin foam - looks fairly good quality for the price paid.  We are hoping that he likes them - sure he will."
5903,1907,4," These are totally fine for the price paid. Yes they are a tad thin and wont last a long time and the elastic is a bit weak but honestly they are great for the price. You get six masks& the colours are really vivid& theyre made of soft foam and any little one who likes dinosaurs is going to love them. Great for party bags too."
5904,1907,5," I ordered these for my nephew and his friends for a party. They loved them (although there was a little arguing over who got to be the 'best' one). They also provided a bit of fun for us adults later on after a couple of drinks! :) They are basic but that was all that was needed and the boys had a lot of fun with them."
5905,1908,4," A little small but looked great with my fancy dress outfit!"
5906,1908,4," as expected"
5907,1909,5," This mask is better than I thought it would be& definitely would recommend this to anyone and even thinking of get more for myself"
5908,1910,5," really cool product- not cheap& but impressive. Moving parts are a great differentiator"
5909,1910,5," Exactly as it is in the shops but arrived at my door quickly and at a good price"
5910,1911,4," Pretty cool"
5911,1912,4," I looked great... haha! its a good mask!"
5912,1912,5," good"
5913,1913,3," Purchased this black mask to go on the front of a top hat for a crow costume. The mask is white plastic painted black& but only on the front& so the white plastic is still visible.  I'll need to paint the rest black so this doesn't show.  OK for the purpose I want it for but not strong enough for a child's continued use. After reading other reviews I was expecting this but not the white plastic. Also it arrived in a brown envelope packed in bubble wrap& the beak has a dent in but still ok for what I want it for. A little disappointing."
5914,1913,5," Does what it says on the tin... will make you look like a bird.Need more words for word count:bluedogstringThat should do it."
5915,1913,4," These masks are eye-catching and cool (if you want to look like Big Bird.) They look just like the picture. The only thing anyone really needs to know is that they are really rather thin and surely won't survive for long if your little ones are stuffing them into a dressing up drawer or box."
5916,1913,5," We used this mask for the raven in our production of Noyes Fludde and it worked brilliantly. It is robust and great value."
5917,1913,5," I am very pleased with the mask. It is bright and colourful with a reasonable amount of feathers on. Perfect for the bird themed party I'm going to wear it to. It arrived ahead of the estimated date& so that was a bonus. I think it is good value for the money paid and I'm happy with the service."
5918,1913,5," I went to a charity HALLOWEEN dressed as a crow with the feather wings i got also &i was very happy.I got the desired effect was also light weight and easy to wear. Have already recomended it."
5919,1913,5," This mask is great! Brought for my sons school play! It is good quality& looks great& fast delivery way quicker then they estimated. And good price. All together brilliant."
5920,1913,4," Great mask& fitted my 5 year old perfectly for his play& would also fit an adult too. Very good value for money and great delivery times. Very pleased"
5921,1914,4," Wasn't expecting it to be cardboard but good for a 2d mask&"
5922,1915,4," This is a fixed piece and the mask does not come away from the head.Nice sculpt and paint app is good although not movie accurate& down side is price and no art boxGreat addition to a Batman collection."
5923,1916,4," Good product.child very happy.only down side is he can't put it on himself it has Velcro staps that adjust on head and needs help"
5924,1917,5," Very effective.  Very easy to transform into character with the hood attached covering your natural hair.  Our children were very convinced by it."
5925,1917,5," Mask arrived and looks exactly as pic/expected- Good value for money and Hobbit obsessed family really like it! Totally recommended item- Thanks!"
5926,1917,2," Smelly rubber and you get covered in ginger hair."
5927,1917,5," Excellent quality"
5928,1918,1," the picture is navy and the actually mask is black like wtf and the feathers are too close to the eyes"
5929,1918,5," Really smart"
5930,1918,5," Comfortable to wear& looks very elegant on also like flower detail on side of mask& i chose this product as it went with my outfit i chise to wear to a friends party. I would recommend his product."
5931,1918,2," Ribbon to tie up came away from mask the first time I wore it. Had taken so long for delivery I didn't bother to send it back. Very pretty but not good quality. Would not recommend"
5932,1918,3," Lovely mask& but came too late for the function it was bought for!!!  If I had known it was coming from abroad I would not have ordered it."
5933,1918,5," I cannot fault the item or the delivery. I ordered the item for a masquerade ball on a cruise in May. I would recommend to friends."
5934,1918,4," A good quality mask at a good price. I would recommend this to anyone lucky enough to be invited to a masked ball."
5935,1918,5," Bought for a masqued wedding reception.  Good quality and comfortable."
5936,1919,4," I bought this for my 5 yr old"
5937,1919,3," Bought this toy mask for a five year old.  It is definitely a solid piece of toy and so you really feel that you are getting your moneys worth here.  If your kids love dressing up / love superheros& then this is an awesome toy for them.  The mask has spoken phrases when a button is pressed and the eye sockets light up too.  If your child is clumsey& it will also protect their face to a certain degree - Bonus!"
5938,1919,5," Bought this for my 4 year old (spiderman mad) nephew"
5939,1919,4," My Grandson loved this he wanted everything spiderman so couldn't go wrong& he looks wicked so no complaints so far."
5940,1919,4," William loved this mask especially as it talks. Finds it a bit heavy on his head& but he is a small 6 year old."
5941,1919,5," my grandson has been wearing it nearly all the time wen not in bed he has great fun thinking he is spider man"
5942,1919,4," Bought for my 4 yr old nephew. He loves it& however it was a little bit heavy. Would still recommend"
5943,1919,1," absolute waist of money &I  bought this for my grandson who is  spider-man  crazy &he  used it once and that was it it was far to big for a 4 yr old the voice you could &nt  understand and that's  when it worked but it was very uncomfortable to wear&No I would not recommend this product to me it was rubbish"
5944,1920,5," This is one of 15 costumes I purchased from the Christy`s costumes range on Amazon as we were arranging a fancy dress evening& we were all amazed at the fantastic quality and value for money of these costumes when they arrivedwe had all individually looked for burlesque costumes and could not find anything that suited &there was some cheap plastic looking outfits out there but nothing like the range and quality we got from the selection on line.I sincerely recommend anyone who is looking for that something different and outstanding quality and value to buy one of these costumes.absolutely 5 starlooking forward my next burlesque evening...Pauly"
5945,1921,5," Bought this for a friend who was awaiting their new false teeth.They saw the funny side&luckily!Now known to his friends as Gnasher !"
5946,1921,5," Very pleased with these two striking masks& they went down well at Meltham Scarecrow Festival"
5947,1921,4," A fun mask"
5948,1922,1," This mask is ridiculous. You cannot see out of the eyes holes whether you are a child or adult. Waste of moneyRefund requested twice. No joy. Goods returned and still no refund. Has put me off amazon"
5949,1922,3," The mask looks the part and on a stag night out my partner got plenty of attention...however it was hard to wear as it really hurts around your eyes.  Its good for a laugh but you can't wear it for long!!"
5950,1922,5," this is a great Mask for the price&"
5951,1922,1," Don't buy this mask its not what it looks like they just take your money and dont care what they send you trust me dont buy it"
5952,1922,4," Nice cheap mask. Perfect for hiding in the bushes and scaring unsuspecting dog walkers."
5953,1922,5," Great mask. My partner nearly had a heart attack when I burst through the back door wearing it with a kitchen knife in my hand. I haven't heard screams like that since I watched Psycho (the original) with my mums ex fella- blag uncle."
5954,1922,5," Great mask have scared a few people with this stay on well to"
5955,1922,5," This mask is great. Looks really good. I put it on with a long black coat& and stumbled out of the fields at night. My ex's little brother and his friend shat themselves& ran back to the house screaming to his mother that there's a weird old man in the field."
5956,1923,5," Excellent service! Excellent customer service! Excellent products.From the moment I purchased the voucher the service was amazing Roth through to checking I liked the product after I had received it.It was quick and they arrive within 3days.And the product is great!Price was the best I could fine too!"
5957,1923,5," This is my second time using this company and I have been very happy with them. Customer service is good and the masks are brilliant ( it's all about picture quality)"
5958,1923,5," Brilliant service& great product& delivery arrived on time - thank you"
5959,1923,5," Brilliant& cheaper than the rest and arrived within a few days."
5960,1923,5," Very good quality! Very good communication with the seller."
5961,1924,3," I ordered two sets for my daughter's birthday party bags& and initially two of panda masks were missing. This was rectified quite quickly once I contacted the seller.  Then& we realised two giraffe masks didn't have elastic bands attached to them (one of them was missing some facial features as well).  To be fair& when I contacted the seller again& they told me to send the faulty items back to them (with the receipt of postage) which will then be exchanged.  This was too closer to the party& and in the end& we had enough masks for the party& so I didn't bother - it required some packaging"
5962,1924,3," My daughter loves these but unfortunately the elastic is not attached very well and through wear the elastic tears the foam mask rendering it useless."
5963,1924,4," I bought these for my two little home-educated relations& who have their own little theatre at home and who love to dress up. The masks are fun to play with although& as has been mentioned& the foam is fairly flimsy and that does mean that the elastic does tear through the holes eventually. My two little friends like to rattle through the different animal impersonations like Tommy Cooper does with the characters in his hat sketch& and that does mean that the wear and tear can be quite substantial. Things get even worse when a grown-up or big head of some other kind becomes embroiled in their production as the strain on both sides of the mask can reach critical levels.We found that a perfectly reasonable way around all that was to stick a pencil to the back of each mask. That way& the children can perform their quick changes without let or hindrance and us adults can let rip with our own impersonations of Johnny Morris. My elephant sounds like Frank Bruno& my mouse like David Beckham. My cat& for some strange reason& sounds like George Galloway. Odd...."
5964,1924,4," nice little mask and not too expensive.. kids had fun at the end of the day.would have been nice if they had more animals"
5965,1924,3," I got these for my son and he quickly managed to break one by just putting it on.  They are made out of very thin craft foam and this just isn't strong enough to take the stress from the elastic.  They look great and I guess you get what you pay for.  I am in the middle of mounting them all on thin card in the hope this gives them more durability."
5966,1924,1," I know it was advertised as variety of masks but 4 cats& 3 giraffes and a tiger& doesn't seem much of a variety to me :("
5967,1924,5," Eight different animals in the pack. Well made material& bright colours& comfortable to wear. Size is suitable for 3 years up& but the material itself is suitable even for babies as there are no small choking hazards on the mask& it's all made of foam pieces and elastic band. The only negative point is that the monkey's face is beige and turquoise and I've never seen a turquoise monkey. However we made this strange colour-pairing into a talking point for the kids and grown ups and it added to the giggles and fun."
5968,1924,4," My daughter loves these and it arrived very fast& i only ordered them yesterday and they came 2day& they are lots of fun."
5969,1925,5," Tamiya is a well respected name in modelling and their masking tape lives up to their reputation.It is paper based and the narrower rolls are just flexible enough to bend round shallow curves. It sticks easily at the paint line and there is no bleed if this is done well.It is easy to remove and doesn't leave any adhesive residue. I have left it on for weeks and it still comes off OK.I am so pleased that I ordered a roll of 40mm wide tape so that I can easily attach paper or polythene on big jobs.It should not be confused with masking tape for house painting. This would be very expensive for that purpose and much too good for most jobs.Excellent product."
5970,1925,3," It's brittle& and breaks easily when trying to get off the roll. You end up with three different tapes which you then have to try to get in line so you can have one tape. Much like cheap clingfilm& you end up chasing the roll round. Maybe the stock is old& but I'm not impressed with this tamiya tape. The thin tape is sooooooo much better. Pliable& flexible& and just the right amount of sticky. For up this money I'd buy normal masking tape& its about the same product."
5971,1925,5," A good bit of kit this stuff& you can put it on to a model finish without worrying that what is underneath will come off with it&( as long as you put on whats underneath correctly) So if you build an paint models& this should be in your toolbox!!"
5972,1925,5," Tamiya masking tape has a long-lived"
5973,1925,4," Not received yet but I'm sure it will be ok when I use it."
5974,1926,5," Excellent& had great fun with all the different animals we bought"
5975,1926,5," excellent"
5976,1927,5," Excellent value"
5977,1928,4," The mask was a great talking point at the Halloween fancy dress party ... Only down side was the first time I tryed it on the back seem tore about an inch and a half ... So I had to use a puncture repair kit on it to strengthen it across the tear ... Deffenately not a toy !"
5978,1928,5," A bit too expensive but then anything to do with iron maiden usually years I absolutely love this mask"
5979,1928,5," Absolutely brilliant&got this for a party&well pleased&excellent quality.."
5980,1928,5," Brilliant& love it fits great"
5981,1929,5," I ordered this mask as part of a Halloween costume and it is absolutely perfect! It arrived quickly and the quality is fantastic! I had lots of comments about how beautiful it was& could even be worn to a masquerade ball. Would definitely recommend! x"
5982,1930,5," Great fun& went down well and keeping them for other gigs"
5983,1931,3," Although there have been many 007's since the first film not many of them has given me the eejibeegis  as Sean Connery did.I suppose one could wear the mask whilst undertaking many roles in life.  Never thought of that before!  The packaging and delivery were good.  Could say this about the last comment."
5984,1931,5," Got this mask for fun on xmas morning"
5985,1931,5," Really prompt delivery"
5986,1932,5," WICKED PRODUCT!!!! Spider-Man fans Will LOVE THIS  AMAZING laser mask!!!! HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED!!!!!Fast an secure Delivery!!!!! Top Seller 5*****â¤ï¸"
5987,1932,5," Perfect thank you very much"
5988,1932,5," Good"
5989,1933,5," lovely mask"
5990,1934,5," Looks and fits great !Look forward to wear it !"
5991,1934,3," It looks pretty. I can't imagine wearing it."
5992,1934,5," Loved it"
5993,1935,5," This mask was brilliant! Although I didn't use it as a fox& it was perfect for morphing into a Harry Potter Kneazle for a social I attended. It didn't itch or hurt my face and sat lovely and snug on my head even though I am pretty small. Lovely mask!"
5994,1935,4," great and well made - took a little time to come but worth the wait"
5995,1936,4," Good but there was no glasses case with it so could be easily damaged. Really fun glasses though."
5996,1937,5," this is superb tape& i wanted it for painting my 1/200 scale battleship Tirpitz and has just the right amount of tack to stick it where you put it and with NO paint seeping under the edges to give a razor sharp edge& and also peels away easily when removing without lifting off paint underneath. i have been building models for 40 years and have tried every masking tape known to man and have not been impressed& until i tried this revell masking tape& it is now the only masking tape i will use& its perfect for the job.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
5997,1937,4," Purchased this tape to help in masking up areas on an Iron Man model kit. Tape leaves clean edges and masks areas well."
5998,1937,4," Elastic bands are a thing of the past with this stuff& started model building again after nearly twenty years& ideal for all the work involved in ship models especially. Will purchase again."
5999,1937,5," Better than tamiya tape and cheaper"
6000,1937,5," Bought for a relative for a project. Excellent for fine masking with no bleed of paint or glue underneath"
6001,1937,4," Is a nice& small masking. i use it to help with painting model and is really good"
6002,1938,4," Was brilliant for Halloween because lots of Chinese tourists wanted their picture taken with the bf.  you can't see out of the mask very well so you do need someone with you to lead you around.  The motion isn't as spectacular as we'd imagined but that might be more because we'd been planning it for over a year.  You do need to be prepared to black out your eyes and find a costume that covers the head and neck.  Tbh a static mask would have done the same job for a lot less money!"
6003,1939,5," I am being  asked to rate  this  as a toy .. as it  is nt a toy then  it wil score low I guess  but its fun ."
6004,1940,5," This mask is completely awesome. looks just like a real goat head in photos. great for fancy dress& hallowe'en& and satanic black mass. x"
6005,1940,4," I bought this a while ago& and ever since it has made me and my mates laugh& well some people find it scary haha. I wore it for halloween& it went done very well. It could maybe be a little bit cheaper? but it fits well on my head and its very comfy& it doesnt itch at all. Verry good and fun product!"
6006,1940,5," Wore this with a suit on Halloween& even though it wasn't scary it pleased a lot of people& even the Police laughed when they passed me in the street!"
6007,1940,5," Brilliant item for a fancy dress party! came within the estimated delivery too! very impressed would recommend to anyone looking for this type of item"
6008,1940,5," A very nice goat mask. My son and his friends enjoyed a lot playing with it. I would recommend it without any doubt."
6009,1940,5," Got to scare a colleague at work who has a fear of goats! Looks good with the grim reaper cloak"
6010,1940,4," This wasn't for me& it was a gift for my grandson&but he enjoyed it very much."
6011,1940,5," My 12 year old looks really funny wearing this - really quite life-like!"
6012,1941,5," These foam masks are fairly comfortable to wear and seem to fit both adults and children well. There is a wide range of different animals. Some are realistic but most  are colourful variants and a few quite difficult to identify. We had a lot of fun with them on several different occasions."
6013,1941,5," I bought them to put in party bags& some of them were a bit larger than the bags but I rolled them slightly to make them fit. I somehow thought it was foam kits for the children to make their own masks& but the masks are already put together. The children really liked them."
6014,1941,5," I'm a childminder and these are great fun for the little one's to see and try.  Every time I leave a room I enter with a different mask on& excellent for teaching little ones about different animals.  I use it as a teaching tool."
6015,1941,5," Loved it! Bought it for my sons birthday party and all the children enjoyed it as well as he did.We kept them for a home play.Great value for money and really fantastic product.HIGHLY recommend :)"
6016,1941,5," These are relatively cheap and I bought them as a |party Bag filler|. They were pretty good and some of the animals are particularly cute. Overall I am quite impressed and would buy them again."
6017,1941,5," Bought these for my sons animal themed birthday party. Everyone loved them. A good selection of animals and all very colourful. Would highly recommend"
6018,1942,4," In the picture& the Musks are pure silver which infact it's black and silver"
6019,1943,5," My Granddaughter wore this to school for her world book day as she loves 101 Dalmatians.  She looked lovely.  Excellent value."
6020,1943,5," Good quality for the price - clever design - stayed on all night& but easy to push up from face for eating / drinking purposes"
6021,1943,5," The is a lovely thing with a secure head band. The colour and quality is very good a good buy."
6022,1943,4," Kids wore it for 101 dalmatians day at school. went down a treat!"
6023,1943,5," very pleased"
6024,1944,5," Quick delivery and good price"
6025,1945,5," I needed a mask for a masquerade party& this mask is beautifully made and looks great& 5/5."
6026,1946,5," Came very quickly - I think within 2 days!"
6027,1947,5," This mask is highly detailed and movie accurate& reminiscent of the movie - V for Vendetta. The density and thickness of the mask came as an acquainted surprise as the material appears ever more solid and structurally sound than I had originally assumed. The mask has thick& durable straps and clips attached to the sides via metal pins and can be readjusted to fit. The package addressed to my location WAS addressed to me& yet another's name suited the box. However& that's a forgivable technicality in my eyes due to the underlaying quality of the product. The measurements are smaller than I had insinuated yet remain a decent (adult) size. However& I can merely drop the measurable notion to fiction as I had not read the measurements given by the seller.My only one complaint is within the protective foam layer that was/is presumed to be attached to the mask before application. This layer was not attached to the mask upon purchase or unboxing despite coming with the mask& but this can simply be applied to the mask by the customer at any point.Overall the mask is a keeper& an eye catcher and 100% movie accurate for those looking for more precision. The quality and structure are sound and the paintwork only captures that quality ever so more. For that& this masks receives a 5/5."
6028,1947,5," This is a really good product. It was shipped very fast and well packaged. It came with a nice little note& and for some reason a free cheap plastic version of the mask as well. The colour is the same as in the photo and it fits well on the head. It has a soft pad for the forehead and the strap is comfortable and strong."
6029,1947,5," really good quality has a strap which you can adjust so it fits your head perfectly. very comfortable& great for parties"
6030,1947,5," Has a nice weight to it and well made. Not the cheap type that you can get. Fits well to the head and has sturdy decent well fitting straps. Came with a foam pad you can glue to the forehead area to give it a more comfortable fit. Would be very hard to break"
6031,1947,5," Really good quality material& not the cheap ones you get for a couple of quid& can't wait till Halloween and the forth of November at midnight in London for the 5th fireworks."
6032,1947,5," my son loves this mask very nice to look at and nice to wear as well! and it is also good as a decoration or doing art whatever it is it does the job!"
6033,1947,4," The mask came in perfect condition and was well packaged. The only problem I have is that it doesn't look exactly like the mask in the image."
6034,1947,5," This one is worth the price. Quality is high& details are well done. I am very happy with this article.I recommend."
6035,1948,5," This masks looks even better than I thought it would& excellent value for money. Thoroughly recommend - very scarey"
6036,1948,2," Looks scary but the plastic/rubber smell is toxic!Got it for my son but I won't ise it as I don't want him to inhale the chemicals used in making this mask.It also looses hair!feels like having a pet around the house!Quality could be improved!"
6037,1948,5," I had ordered this for my son for Halloween went down very well. Delivery was fast and on time. I have no complaints what so ever."
6038,1948,4," This mask is really scary looking but was hard to see out of the eye holes. Not seller issue but a design issue. Other than that great mask. If you wear glasses& be warned that this mask is hot and your glasses will fog up."
6039,1949,5," Arrived in the stated time. Much cheaper than other sellers for exactly the same mask. Brilliant item very scary."
6040,1949,2," Mask is very large and doesn't look like the picture but arrived on time &not worth the money"
6041,1949,5," perfect"
6042,1950,5," very pretty"
6043,1951,5," Excellent quality and good value for money.  I like the design of the headband rather than a tie around the back.  I would definitely recommend."
6044,1951,4," Bought this for a masked ball and it was just the thing. It felt quite plush though it was not expensive and I had lots of compliments. it is padded so quite comfortable to wear except that it sits quite a long way off your face so you tend to peer through it. I have carefully put it away in the hope that I can find an excuse to wear it again"
6045,1951,4," Got this for a masquerade ball and thought it was beautiful.  Got great complements about how pretty it is.  It is great quality and lasted the night undamaged.The great thing is the headband as you don't have to hold it onto your head& and the headband messes your less than having to tie it around your head.The only downside I would say is that you have very limited peripheral vision which can be off putting and actually made me remove it half way through the night.I would recommend it as it looks as good in person as it does on the ad. Its easier to wear and is good quality. Compared to masks others had - it is actually good value"
6046,1951,3," Beautiful product& feels like good quality and sturdy. However the size small was far too big for my rather average sized head& so it kept blinding me and appeared too big on my face."
6047,1951,5," This mask was truly amazing& had everybody asking me where I got it from& so I told them. The only sad fact is that they had left it too late to order and have it delivered on time for themselves. This arrived spot in time and the quality is just 100% and not some cheapo mask. All in all& money worth and wisely spent."
6048,1951,4," Looked lovely and the headband made it very comfortable to wear. Have to say it made my face hot and was strange not having full vision but overall a hit!"
6049,1951,5," Very comfortable to wear"
6050,1952,5," Fab Fun Mask for my sons birthday party"
6051,1952,5," Brilliant just right for the price"
6052,1953,4," Went down well at a fancy dress party but - be warned - it does not stay on well unless you add an extra piece of elastic across the back& just at the ends of the head-band. Very easy to do& though I think the manufacturers could have thought of that."
6053,1953,5," This is the 2nd one I have bought & Love it ! The first one was a White Dog & which I wore at a fundraising stall. everyone Loved it & the only thing was I had to put elastic on bottom of headband as it was falling off & And he had to go to the groomers as the hair was in my eyes !  Otherwise it was great :)"
6054,1953,4," I bought this mast as part of a costume for a play we were performing.  It was great and did the job - looks brilliant in the dvd.  My only criticism is that it didn't stay in place too well as the weight of the nose pulled it forward.  It's great fun though and I do recommend it."
6055,1953,3," bought this for my son to wear during a school play. During rehearsals he fluff came off in his eyes"
6056,1953,4," Careful as the hair moults easily and gets in your eyes& otherwise a good purchase and works for the play we are doing. The noisy nose is a little annoying though."
6057,1953,5," This looks great for what I need - being Santa Paws at a charity gig! Awesome mask with thr fun bark just a little hard to see where I'm going might need a trim!"
6058,1954,5," Beautiful mask exactly as described.  Comfortable enough to wear the whole evening of the ball.  Despatched and arrived as stated."
6059,1954,5," Delivery was good and price was fab. Brought For xmas masquerade party and wow its stunning had loads of compliments from my colleagues."
6060,1954,5," This was a really impressive mask and well worth the price. It came well packaged and consequently arrived intact. Great item& perfect for any masquerade ball/costume party. The only issue I had was that I struggled a little with the headband which secured the mask to my head but I worked it our eventually!"
6061,1954,5," Great item and great value for money.Quality really good& only down side was large black headband that mask was secured too. Covered band with purple ribbon and this looked better.Band is a good idea though as oppose to elastic as doesn't affect your hair do or leave indentations ie hat hair!"
6062,1954,5," After a long research I bought this mask because of the reviews. It looks very nice on and it is comfy to wear. I took it to Venice for the carnival and even the locals were impressed with it. It lasted all the trip to Italy and I have now hanged in the wall of my bedroom. Highly recomended."
6063,1954,5," Beautiful mask& comfortable& and if it gets a bit hot it's hinged to the headband so you simply push it up.  I thought the ribbons might be annoying& but I didn't notice them at all.  I had lots of compliments.  Excellent value for money& felt and looked much more expensive than it was."
6064,1954,4," This looks lovely in real life. The only downside was...is...that the ribbons are kinked from storage and you cannot get the kinks out!It looks lovely on and the headband means it is easy to put on and off. Great value mask."
6065,1954,5," Arrived quickly and I really like how it fits& I thought it would be a tie around head but instead it's a comfortable head band fits very well"
6066,1955,5," grand"
6067,1956,5," These are nice masks& good quality plastic and  good value.Size for smaller faces& ladies and children really.Ordered more."
6068,1957,5," Excellent product& good service. Thank you."
6069,1958,5," Got this for my son-in-law's birthday& and he loved it. Excellent mask. Thank you so much."
6070,1959,5," These are so fabulous. Really made our party. Delivery was excellent."
6071,1960,4," expected it to cover more of the face&but still does the job. materials seem to be strong enough to withstand children' handling"
6072,1960,5," Truly hilarious..know home should be without one!"
6073,1961,5," Perfect for a dressing up box for a photobooth at our recent party. Excellent value and sturdy enough to survive kids and adults alike rummaging in the box. They appeared in most photos so must have been popular!"
6074,1961,5," Splendid glasses for a Hawaiian themed evening out. I wore mine in Benidorm (oh yes). I do not recommend for driving& sunbathing& reading or seeing in general however."
6075,1961,5," Wore to an Hawaiin themed  40th. They were an add on item - good fun and at the price& quite disposable but funny enough to get lots of comments."
6076,1961,5," Great novelty glasses& well loved at weddings and party and been well use by customers in my photo booth"
6077,1961,5," I bought these for a friend who is a childrens entertainer"
6078,1961,4," Exactly what i needed for a party. Don't expect amazing quality& these are just for fun."
6079,1961,4," A bit later delivered than advertised but to be expected at this time of year"
6080,1961,5," Arrived fast good fun sun glasses good for beach|hawiian party"
6081,1962,4," I purchased this product as part of a devil costume& it is a good fit& comfortable to wear and looks great. The delivery was alot better than expected.There is one small problem with the mask is that the elastic string which goes around the back of your head seems a bit weak& but this can easily be corrected and is a very small problem."
6082,1962,5," Great quality mask - bought for a masked ball - comfortable to wear and very effective- I added devil wings too.As per other review - elastic the mask comes with is a little thin so I added some more - simple to do -meant I could wear the mask whole evening."
6083,1962,4," Husband wore this to a masquerade ball.  It is a stunning looking thing when it is on.  It would probably be ok to wear at halloween too.  Now hanging above my kitchen window& as a reminder of a memorable night."
6084,1962,4," Great mask and fits quite well even on my smallish face.  Strings at back probably need re-enforcing to last the whole of this year's NYE& but otherwise a great purchase!"
6085,1962,5," Drew some fascinating looks at the recent ball I attended - kept it on as long as I could& no-one else wore anything remotely like it so very pleased with my purchase."
6086,1962,3," I think this mask is ok but calling it deluxe is slightly dressing up the truth& I would have preferred |posh plastic|"
6087,1962,5," Ordered 23rd Dec& arrived 8am on the 24th!! Super speedy& great item& as others has stated the elastic may need strengthening"
6088,1962,5," Exactly the same as every one else& lovely mask& well made but crap elastic& order early so you and replace the elastic"
6089,1963,5," I bought this mask for a masquerade themed wedding and it is really pretty and quite hard wearing. It was perfect for what I needed it for."
6090,1963,4," I bought this for a dress-up viewing of Labyrinth and was really pleased with it. It's really attractive& was quite comfortable and got lots of compliments! I would prefer an elasticated headband (just for ease of getting it on and off)& and the eye holes were a tiny bit too wide apart (but that might just be for my face!). It didn't really impede my enjoyment of wearing it!"
6091,1963,5," The colours on this mask are really nice. The mask was quite wide for my head& cut it didn't look silly. I had loads of comments on how good it looked!"
6092,1964,5," But the character is called Buster Brady...not Brown. Odd that official merchandise gets that wrong."
6093,1965,4," bought for my sons birthday party bags! The kids love them and they are nice and soft made with foam so nice to wear and flexable. I ordered 36 and one came without any decoration and i contacted the company and they re-sent another one within 48hrs. great service& good price& ideal for kids/parties etc. cheap fun!"
6094,1965,3," My daughter has used these masks a fair bit in her play. However they are quite flimsy and the elastic has now snapped on one and the hole has broken on another simply by putting on and off. Need to be sturdier at sides. Wouldn't buy again."
6095,1965,3," Received the masks today& disappointed as image showed 6 different masks& and i relieved only 3 designs& m2x cows& 2 xdogs& 2 x pigs .the children each wanted a different animal for a party.  Need them for Friday so no time to reorder"
6096,1965,5," Nice product for party bag if you have arraned a birthday party themed farm. Interestingly you can also teach children OldMcdonald song with it. I have used them in my son  birthday party as a part of party game and they loved it...."
6097,1965,4," Simple foam masks& purchased for nativity costume specifically the cow mask. arrived very quickly& well packaged.  Not especially robust for everyday play between 3 boys but great for costume/fancy dress party. good value for money."
6098,1965,5," These were amazing value! really well made& quick delivery& perfect for my toddlers birthday party.I think I paid under Â£3 and they are well worth it!!"
6099,1965,5," I bought these for party bag gifts and they were good quality and great value - I was very pleased with them.  Much nicer than the usual plastic tat!"
6100,1965,5," We got these for a farm party on holiday. They are v lightweight and easily portable& threy look the part and there is a good selection. Very cheap."
6101,1966,3," Good looking fun mask but it was far too big (adult Male) and the smell of the latex was very bad. No way could you wear this for more than a few minutes. When we tried it on found it very difficult to see out of the eye holes.On a good note it arrived in good time and well packaged and gave us a few good laughs whilst trying it on."
6102,1966,5," really great mask& little bit hot inside but really awesome looking& you will get a lot of compliments and photo requests"
6103,1966,5," great value and good service"
6104,1967,5," Mask arrived in a box well protected from the travel in the post and looked exactly as shown in the picture.Good quality mask and fits the face very well.Seems to sit better on female faces rather than men as the eves are further forward and therefore more prominent but it works well for everyone.The smiling face also takes on a sinister air which is quite amusing :-)"
6105,1967,4," The plastic is a bit hot after a short while of wearing it and the nose doesn't quite fit a male face. Still good enough for use though& good price also!"
6106,1967,3," I gave this 3* as the hole in the mouth spoilt the photos& didn't matter too much as this was covered up using software program."
6107,1968,3," I ordered this for my fiances friends stag but I ordered it too late. Therefore I am now stuck with Gary Barlows face. I guess it'll come in handy one day! Lol."
6108,1968,5," If you want to look like Gary Barlow this is the mask for you.My partner loves mr Barlow&now she loves me to."
6109,1968,2," The size of the mask is brilliant& but the picture they chose to print was blurred and a bit pixelated. I was expecting a picture of higher quality."
6110,1968,5," We used this mask for a Britain's got Talent spoof - it was the audience favourite - brilliant fun and highly recommended!"
6111,1968,2," Would like to see these in packs of say 6 or more to get even better value& as people usually buying them for parties."
6112,1968,5," Excellent for wandering around the park in the middle of the night. Really s***s up the pensioners !"
6113,1969,4," Russell Brand fan loved it"
6114,1970,4," Bought for a friend for Christmas day"
6115,1971,2," Didn't stay up and kept rolling down& cut into my feet and I walked& they were good quality material but I couldn't really wear due to the fact they would just roll down."
6116,1971,4," Good quality stocking& if rather long& so if you have really long legs these will be fine. Much rather long than too short!! A good purchase."
6117,1971,2," Pretty stockings.  But they only come in one size fits all.I'm a slim size 10 and they are too tight at the top.Shame."
6118,1971,5," lush sexy great fit mmmmmmmmmmm look greeat with contagious rave wear easter bunny party time is just ba week away"
6119,1972,5," Just the right size for my Glam night out and arrived very quickly and no scratches& would order again from this company"
6120,1972,5," I got these along with some pineapple ones for a fancy dress do.  These were sturdier than expected and looked fab.  Every one commented on how good they looked."
6121,1972,3," these props look great but u cant see threw them properly and you end up taking them off waste of time if you want them as part of a costume."
6122,1972,4," Bought for a fancy dress party and finished it off to a tee. Arrived in good time"
6123,1972,5," better than Elton John's rant at the concert !"
6124,1973,5," V quick delivery& and item looks great! Going to have fun with these& would recommend seller to all."
6125,1973,3," Arrived late. But is as described."
6126,1974,5," My great grandson is delighted with the Shepherd Figure& anotheraddition to his growing collection of Schleich Farm buildings andanimals etc."
6127,1974,5," Arrived before expected. Great detail as with all Schleich models."
6128,1974,5," Nice figure& great detail& can recommend it"
6129,1974,5," lovely Item"
6130,1975,5," What can i say its a vet figure who looks like she was born in Sweden and moved to Australia ."
6131,1976,5," Rapid delivery and used with ELC farm"
6132,1977,3," Felt this item was overpriced for what it is& also hoped it would be a little larger than it was &somewhat disappointing ."
6133,1977,5," Beautiful snow leopard& excellent price and fast delivery."
6134,1977,5," Probably the best figurine in my collection. Superb."
6135,1977,5," lovely model and very cute"
6136,1977,5," Nice"
6137,1978,5," Supet papo leopard spot appaloosa. Looks good under saddle& either english or western."
6138,1978,5," Excellent product. Prompt delivery. Thanks."
6139,1978,5," Just like it said it would be."
6140,1979,5," Happy with the item."
6141,1980,5," Beautifully made. Worth the price and so nice to hod compared to plastic toys!"
6142,1981,4," I bought this as a birthday gift for my mother as she has always loved Eeyore. It was a little smaller than I thought it would be when it arrived but she liked it all the same."
6143,1981,5," Brought this for the girlfriend for our anniversary. Well made and done exactly what I wanted to! Made her smile"
6144,1981,3," Not wat I expected as thought was a figurine but still lovely for wat or is."
6145,1981,5," Another lovely figurine for our set& yet again very good value."
6146,1981,5," Perfect birthday cake topper& my partner loved it"
6147,1982,3," A well crafted product with excellent detail. More a collector model than a toy. Small fragile parts make it unsuitable as a play article for a young person"
6148,1982,3," Nice digger but my 2.5 year old pulled all the parts off it straight away. Windows all come off easily and various other bits so I'd recommend the age be increased slightly unless your toddler is less |inquisitive| than mine!"
6149,1982,5," Amazing detail and working parts. A great addition to my son's growing Bruder collection"
6150,1983,5," I bought this as a christmas gift for my 6 year old daughter. She loved it! Good quality horse models to paint. She really enjoyed it"
6151,1983,5," Brilliant value! Bought one for friend as a fun secret Santa gift and had to get another gorgeous daughter! Izzy was so excited and couldn't wait to get it out and start decorating them!"
6152,1983,5," I bought this as a gift for a 6 year old horse lover.  The figurines look good quality and although it states it is for age 8+& I am sure it will be simple to paint for a 6 year old."
6153,1983,4," Bought this for my niece for her xmas present and she LOVED it. It is a shame there was only 2 ornaments in there as she would have kept painting on if there was more..."
6154,1983,5," Daughter had great fun painting these. The paint is good quality and more than enough to complete the task . Overall great value for a rainy afternoon craft session !"
6155,1984,5," Excellent toy& delivered promptly."
6156,1984,5," Grate servise grate product top"
6157,1984,5," Quick delivery. All good."
6158,1984,5," My 8 Year old loved this"
6159,1985,5," I have been buying the Holztiger Animal Collection for my daughter as I think they are extremely well made& and are in fact are hand made. The collection is vast& and has many animals to collect& and dinosaurs too. The animal carving/toys are expensive& but they are made of high grade wood& and each animal is unique and special.Presently I am collecting the 'animal collection' and will eventually look at the other collections.I would highly recommend Holztiger to anyone who wants to give their child a well made toy."
6160,1986,5," well I didn't but our grandson love it"
6161,1987,5," Really nice ornament"
6162,1988,5," My son hasn't stopped playing with it!"
6163,1988,5," Arrived as scheduled/"
6164,1988,4," good product but unfortunately had to return as this was a duplicate present"
6165,1988,5," MY GRANDAUGHTER LOVES THIS!"
6166,1988,5," Great present"
6167,1989,4," Excellent quality.  Well crafted and finished paintwork beautifully.  Bought it for our baby son's first Christmas and would buy it again for friend's children.Le Toy Van Painted Wooden Le Petit Ark"
6168,1989,4," Bought as a gift for grandson and will be great aid to help his coordination and learning how to fit shapes in holes and learn about different animals"
6169,1989,5," This product is wonderful and very helpful with developing childrens hand eye co-ordination. The colours are bright and cheerful and would easily attract a childs attention. It will be around for many years as a well used toy :)"
6170,1989,5," Beautifully made and very solid. Hours of fun for a small person. Highly recommended.  Very durable too& this is the second one I've bought"
6171,1989,4," I bought this for a friend's newborn daughter. The intention being that it would look great as a decoration in her nursery until she was able to play with it herself.  My 3 year old took it out of the box and loved it& so many years of play value! It is very well made and has great attention to detail in the figures. Am going to buy another soon for a friend's daughter's christening."
6172,1989,5," I'm definitely buying this for my little girl's 2nd birthday. We bought it as a Christmas gift for a 28 month old boy. I worried that it might be too young for him because he's quite an advanced little fellow& however on the day he opened it he absolutely loved it. His imaginary play kicked in and of course there's a challenging 'puzzle' element to it which can be seen in the photo. Like most kids& he discovered that it's just easier to shove all of the animals into the ark rather than try and fit them through their individual slot. The quality& from what I saw& was excellent. It was immediately loved and withstood a fair bit of throwing around without chipping or breaking.I got another text yesterday from his mum saying he loved his ark and hadn't stopped playing with it. It's colourful& great for hand-eye coordination and problem solving skills& as well as fun for the imagination& which is the best part of being a kid."
6173,1989,5," Fantastic christening present for 1 year old. Brilliant colours and well thought out wanted to play with it myself! Different colours to group together and a shape sorter plus learning about different animals and the Noaks Ark tale from the Bible."
6174,1989,5," This is a very aesthetically pleasing ark. My son likes it& unfortunately I gave it him for his first birthday and it has taken a beating - he dropped it so one of the curved ark corners came away& half the roof and half the animals have also been placed behind various radiators in the house and are wedged so I can't get them out. Despite this its still one of my sons favourite toys and even with the roof partially missing it looks pretty on the shelf in his room."
6175,1990,4," I have reviewed other Schleich figures - I know its described as an elf wedding - but to my daughter they are fairies !!! As always they are nice figures& this was good value and a nice addition to our fairy family. I have a four year old who loves all things fairy and yes they are just figures but listening to her as she uses her imagination is always amazing& she also likes the more sinister figures (good v evil )  and we have dragons at the gate of the castle. This purchase will hopefully add to the story telling !"
6176,1990,5," i thought i had already done a review -- i find i am doing many reviews more than once -- these wer a good buy"
6177,1990,5," my 6 year old is collecting these and loves all of them  really good quality and detail& highly recommended"
6178,1990,5," Bought for my granddaughter. Perfect& just what she wanted"
6179,1990,5," lovely set of toys for little and big kids"
6180,1991,4," The English Horse and Rider Set was a much better product than the individual tack set and doll. A better price and the dolls hat stays on. Still a little bit expensive& but better value as you get the doll and the horse and tack together. I would recommend that you buy this product ."
6181,1991,5," Lovely 1:9 scale toy horse given daughter hours of fun. True life likeness.Would highly recommend well worth the money"
6182,1991,5," This horse and rider set is excellent value for money as you do get everything that is pictured.  This also meant that my daughter& who loves all things Breyer& was able to play with it immediately.  I would definately recommend it to anyone who loves Breyer."
6183,1991,5," My granddaughter loved it and has played with it for hours. The toy looks very well made and I would recommend it to a friend"
6184,1992,5," GOOD"
6185,1993,5," Lovely model as usual of one of my favourite breeds too! Lovely features and face& very realistic and extremely quick delivery! Ordered it early morning one night and it came the next day! Only problems were the paint had seeped a bit down the tail and one of the hoofs wasn't quite fully painted but it was just a one off as I've ordered many recently! Definitely recommend! Really pleased! :-)"
6186,1993,5," This is an amazing model! My 11 yr old daughter is getting this for one of her many schleich this christmas! she makes her own tack aswell! i can see this guy getting a lot halters! shes also getting the schleich Fjord family! she just loves them!"
6187,1993,5," Challenger second in charge of my herd."
6188,1993,5," THANK YOU."
6189,1993,5," Very good brithday gift"
6190,1994,5," My grandchildren really loved receiving  these through the post"
6191,1994,5," As expected.. all different frogs"
6192,1994,5," Excellent thank you."
6193,1995,5," I was expecting this to be made of china& but it is made of a rubbery plastic& however it is beautifully made and rather beautiful."
6194,1995,5," Love these figurines so realistic looking have ordered loads of other animals in this range"
6195,1995,5," Beautiful detail love it love it love it"
6196,1995,5," very nice like it"
6197,1996,3," Nicely crafted and everything& just not what I was expecting. It's a really small plastic toy& when to be honest I originally thought it was an ornament  of some sort. But I guess that was my own fault for not double checking. But I do think it should be stated more clearly that it is in fact a small toy. But I will be keeping it either way& as we love huskies& and anything husky - toy or not - is fine with us!"
6198,1996,3," Lovely gift however delivery charge was way too!"
6199,1996,4," Not quiet what i expected&but nice none the less"
6200,1997,5," Ordered two of the pigs. They are very lifelike and made of good quality plastic. Quality is equal to the animals made from the reputable Schleich company. I can highly recommend this pig figure and its good value for money"
6201,1998,2," Bought this for my granddaughter who seems to like it and has added it to her extensive collection. Vastly overpriced and obviously reliant on a current craze& I honestly thought it was akin to something you would think twice about buying from a pound shop.The item came well packed but& the box it was in appeared to have kicked around the warehouse floor before actually finding its way in to the packaging.The |glitter| doesn't shimmer& sparkle or do anything in particular to justify its inclusion. I expected something like the old |snowstorm| paperweights that you used to shake& but the foil cut outs only decide to move very slowly upwards once it is held upside down and then fall equally slowly back to the feet again when turned upright. Shaking it does absolutely nothing to increase the movement and whoever designed it obviously did not have the time or inclination to carry out any serious research.I have given it two stars because my granddaughter appeared to like it although I did not see her actually play with it for long. For me it's less than one star& but then again I am someone who (probably unrealistically) expects a bit of thought and effort to go into things - even if they are |only| for children - rather than profiteering from the |tat| that this seems to be."
6202,1998,2," So disappointed. When i read the product dimensions I thought it was for the pony.It was for the packaging.I have just spent Â£15 on a tiny item worth about Â£6."
6203,1998,5," my granddaughter loves this."
6204,1998,2," Much smaller than I expected and the glitter does not move easily. Rather disappointed"
6205,1998,5," for all ages relly as there are adults kids teens who heart this"
6206,1998,3," Check the sizes as it is really small!!"
6207,1998,5," Beautiful. Daughter loves it."
6208,1998,4," love the moving glitter!"
6209,1999,5," This guys from schleich make perfect animal toys& they are professionals with their job!!!Every item is perfect handmade with all details about the item!This pug is goooooood dogie for your collection :)))"
6210,1999,5," Great Item! Many thanks!"
6211,1999,5," Bought the whole |family| of Schleich pugs for my daughter as she loves this breed of dogs. She has not been at all disappointed with them and has hours of fun with them."
6212,2000,5," My six year old daughter was very excited to get this and has not been able to resist playing with it at every opportunity since we got it.  It is a really good toy for role playing with the characters and there is quite a bit to it really.  Plenty to fire up a child's imagination.  I love that the jail window bars can be pushed out& inviting a great jail break story line& and the double doors of the Police Station can be dramatically flung open with the head of a felon!The Police station is kitted out with plenty of furniture including chairs& desks and computers.  The characters are great too and come with a number of accessories including guns& walkie-talkies& keys and handcuffs (which can attach to the villains wrists and to parts of the jail including the window bars.  The motorbike is good and can be freestanding quite stably.  The whole thing can easily be closed up and locked closed and then carried for storage/travel purposes and there is plenty of room inside for all the various figures and accessories.  This was one thing that strongly appealed to us about this set because we never know where to put these things& they collect dust& and you end up losing the small parts.The assembly is relatively straightforward and took around 15 minutes or so.  It was too difficult for my six year old daughter to follow the instructions and do it herself though"
6213,2000,5," Grandson was delighted with this& enhanced his other city  police collection. After I had accepted the massive delivery delay it was worth the wait."
6214,2000,5," Excellent product which my little one loves l. Good price and quick delivery."
6215,2000,4," My son hasn't stopped lying with it since I gave it to him."
6216,2001,5," Just what the girlfriend wanted! Has a thing for pink and ponies so I got her this to make her happy!"
6217,2001,5," I keep buying these as party gifts for my daughter's friends who are turning five. It's the perfect little gift. My daughter spends ages playing with ponies and brushing their hair. Speedy delivery too."
6218,2001,4," Lovely little toy but description says there is a comb which does not seem to be the case! A shame because the grooming bit seems to be the point :-("
6219,2001,5," Love this little pinkie pie pony. Quite unusual looking with the mask too. Good price& very happy!"
6220,2001,3," nice product a bit expensive for the size great service though"
6221,2002,5," Lovely& well made& well painted figure. Bought for a Christmas scene and many people have commented how realistic he is. Would be an excellent quality toy as well."
6222,2002,5," Schleich's range of dinosaurs and animals is fantastic! We have hundreds of them& and this buck is as good as the rest."
6223,2002,5," Great& safe delivery and petite& delightfully cute reindeer - our granddaughter loves it!! Thank you!!"
6224,2002,5," Lovely made.  Would recommend this make for all animals& superior to any other although more expensive"
6225,2002,5," so real looking and did a lovely job on top of my Christmas cake. Thank you"
6226,2002,5," Lovely detail . Just what I wanted for Christmas art project ."
6227,2002,4," I like Schlich animals. As good as expected"
6228,2003,4," bought for grandson  its a bit bigger than i imagined but happy with it"
6229,2003,4," Very good but britains r the best"
6230,2003,4," My boys love this& the only slight issues I have are that it's quite flimsy and appears easily breakable plus the roof constantly falls off."
6231,2003,5," My son loves his new barn and has already filled it with cattle& hay and machinery just like the real thing!"
6232,2003,5," Good service and  product but may prove a bit fragile for very young children."
6233,2004,5," brilliant perfect for it needs make someone very happy. size was perfect detail was absolutely amazing very good buy thank you"
6234,2004,5," Beautiful little piece.  My daughter is Lion King mad and we have all of the big name lion figurines which she pretends are characters from the Lion King.  When we came across these Disney figures right before her birthday we were thrilled!  We weren't disappointed!  Lovely quality and detail."
6235,2004,3," I was very dissapointed when i recieved this item as it looked better in the picture then in person. However tha paint work was very good but it can easily break as the legs are to weak."
6236,2004,5," Bought this for a friend and I nearly kept it for myself! The deatil is great and its a good buy."
6237,2004,5," Beautiful bought for a birthday present more than happy"
6238,2004,5," My grandson loves this"
6239,2005,5," Lovely model& very realistic and gorgeous features! Fast and well protected shipping. Very happy! :-)"
6240,2005,3," While the horse is lovely the rider we bought from Schleich didn't  fit as the horse is too wide. Wish they would make that clearer in the description."
6241,2005,4," Schleich have great& sturdy and realistic toys& and this one is no different."
6242,2005,4," quality as expected"
6243,2005,5," Good quality"
6244,2006,5," Sturdy& son loves it."
6245,2007,5," Beautiful little princess forum sons knight castle .. He wanted a beautiful girls figure for the knights to rescue from the dragons lol... Fast delivery .. Good detail and overall quality product very happy"
6246,2008,5," I am a huge mega fan of merlin and i just got my merlin gwen figure today and i am the fist person in the world to have her at last my merlin figure collection is finally complete&..yes fantatic delivery service would highly recommend this figure for anyone who loves merlin. the detail on the figure is really amazing and looks just like the actress who plays gwen in the show!I would highly recommend this seller for your purchase& excellent service!"
6247,2008,5," Love the fact fan's finally get their hands on Gwen figure but& it seems out of place in he series there needs to be a king Arthur or more updated figures to go with her status. Plus I don't understand why she has Aithusa egg."
6248,2008,5," This is a great addition to my collection - baby Aithusa is so cute!! Arrived earlier than predicited so it was a great surprise to finding it waiting for me when I got home."
6249,2009,5," Excellent product. The Ghost rider fits perfectly on the horse. These types of toys last for years. Very good quality. 10/10."
6250,2010,5," My mum and I decided to buy this for my pocket money because I needed a dungeon for  my pirates so I bought it. When I opened it I was AMAZED ! It was not that easy to assemble but at the end It was like a real dungeon ! I play for hours  with it .  The pirates had a plan to save the captain and really the captain ran  away  from the dungeon. This set contains 3 figures of soldiers&weapons&  1 eagle& the main dungeon& and 3 barrels . I really enjoyed this dungeon! I can give this toy more than 5 stars!"
6251,2010,5," This was a lot bigger than I was expecting"
6252,2010,5," My son already has playmobil pirate ships& with this addition to his collection he just has hours of fun. Comes with lots of items and was larger than expected."
6253,2010,5," It looks just like a real one in Jamaica. It's great to play with a Fort& lots of fun. Recommend"
6254,2010,5," Bought as a present for my 5 year old grandson. He absolutely loves it! It's quite a substantial toy so very reasonable price. Playmobil really know how to make exciting toys for growing imaginations."
6255,2010,5," Another gem from Playmobil. My 4 year old loves this and spends hours playing with it and the pirate ships. Mostly dropping unsuspecting pirates through the trap door. Lots of bits to keep his imagination going. Some reviews comment on difficulty with construction. I see it as all part of the fun of getting a new toy and an opportunity for your child to join in with searching for the pieces in the bags they come in. Treat it as a fun search rather than a chore and your child will want to help too."
6256,2010,5," Birthday present for my Grandson.  He loved it and couldn't wait to construct it. A great success."
6257,2010,5," Great toy.  This was a Christmas present for my son (5) to complement his Pirate Ship& and it's a big hit.  Has seen a lot of play& and is at its best in our regular Saturday morning battles.  Took me about 10 minutes to put it together straight out of the box& very high quality - as Playmobil always is."
6258,2011,5," Same as  Deaths Head Pirate - excellent.  My grandson says they are really good and he loves the different varieties he now has."
6259,2011,5," A 1&  Excellent.What every little boy wants& a reallyScary character& I get them for my grandson Freddie& he is into knights and pirates& at the moment."
6260,2012,3," I purchased the siege tower with battering ram for my son at Christmas along with the Excalibur castle!!All EXCELLENT!! but a pity that the seige tower battering ram is too high to actually break the break away wall section itself!!5 mm lower and it will do it perfectly!!Maybe a small design fault?"
6261,2012,5," I bought this for my grandson's Christmas to go with a medievel castle and he loved it. A well made toy that will give him hours of pla time. Highly recommend."
6262,2013,5," My three year old received this for his birthdy and loved it.  He enjoys creating adventures for the knights and involving them in his other playmobil sets.  Only downside for parents is that small hands have difficulty in putting helmets on the knights and placing various weapons in hands.  A great toy for developing imagination and encouraging children to understand our history."
6263,2013,5," In my son's opinion this is the best toy he got this Christmas and it has kept him occupied for a long time. His favourite thing is to make up a battle with a big side defending and a small attacking group."
6264,2013,5," The toy was received well and played with excitement.  We will certainly use your services again for the purchase of more playmobil toys."
6265,2013,5," As with all playmobil toys& this was greatly enjoyed& not only by the recipient& but by all the siblings and friends.The set was to complement a playmobil castle and has already given lots of pleasure."
6266,2013,5," Bought to add to Lion Knight Castle.Birthday present for my 6 year old grandson.Looking forward to playing with this set-upWe have loads of 'vintage' playmobil stuff from our 19 year old grandsons childhood.Still the best product of it's kind.Highly ecommended."
6267,2013,5," This is a lovely toy. Just enough bits to make it interesting& without being too complicated for little fingers. My grandson and I have much fun with it."
6268,2013,5," Used these along with a sticker reward chart to bribe my three year old son to start using his potty.  Didn't really work& but he adores his knights and plays with them all the time.  All the add ons are top.  Oh to be five again!"
6269,2013,5," i got this as a christmas pressie for my 5 year  i thought it was a good price& cheaper than the shops my boy hasnt seen it yet but i have looked at it and its what i would expect from playmobil so im happy"
6270,2014,5," Was bought as a present.Recipiant is very happy with this item."
6271,2015,5," My son is very happy"
6272,2016,5," Thank you."
6273,2017,2," Not a great buy. But I suppose I should have expected that for the price. Figures are tiny and not great quality. Ok if you just want something cheap or for older kids. But I would not recommend them for younger children (my son is 3). I have now bought other figures in a Toys R Us store which I could look at and handle: they are good quality& large and reasonably priced. No complain about the seller- just not a great item."
6274,2017,4," Knights plus two horses& trebuchet and dragon& all different& all painted reasonably& No loose weapons or helmets so good for younger children with their first castle& and the scale was good for fitting under arches (half the size of Papo knights). Good value.Treat the tube as nice wrapping not a storage container as it is too narrow to get the knights out of easily."
6275,2017,4," Super addition to my castle figures for role play in my classroom. Have stood up to many battles in the hands of 5 and 6 year olds without breakages. Not all the figures stand up independently but each knight and dragon is different from the others& so makes a really nice set."
6276,2017,2," Ordered this on 5th December and arrived on 9th January. Not worth the wait. The figures are well painted but smaller than I expected and within 5 minutes all of the weapons had broken off. The tube was crushed as well."
6277,2017,1," A lot smaller than I thought they would be and expensive for what they are. Took ages to arrive& but I think they came from America. Disappointed."
6278,2017,5," Used these as decorations for my brothers 50th Medieval cake& if I had kids of this age they would be a fantastic toy to travel with& superb item"
6279,2017,4," for my great grandson and he says they are great easy to play with and just what he wanted. Post was a bit slow but that could be the bfpo."
6280,2017,3," They're what we expected and do the trick. My little guy hasn't shown too much interest in them& but they're fairly well made."
6281,2018,5," I have bought the Papo Big Farm and lots of Papo figures both from Amazon and Wonderland Models( the cheapest across the board. These figures/animals are very realistic and scale at 1/24 so are big but marvellous. Cannot wait to see my Grandson's face"
6282,2019,5," Cool!!! And BIG!!!"
6283,2020,5," Excellent. Get the horse too. They fit perfectly and are very good quality. 10/10."
6284,2020,3," Really nice item but picture was a bit decieving& i thought it was much bigger."
6285,2020,5," fab"
6286,2021,5," very well painted&and durable and so life like&Luke and Ben just love these&papo toys are of a very high quality i would recommend to anyone&but were did he leave his horse it is on here"
6287,2021,5," Beautiful figure!  It is made to be mounted on the Papo horse& so if you choose to have the figure without the horse (as I did) then it comes up a little shorter than& for instance& the Papo Queen figure that we bought to go with him!"
6288,2021,5," Delivery was good& the product is lovely and sturdy and has a lot of detail& my four year old boy loves it and I'm very pleased"
6289,2021,5," Whilst at Hampton Court my son purchased (with pocket money) a horse by Papo and loved it so much& that I decided to get him the rider.  A sneaky look at amazon to compare prices revealed a cheaper price.  Hence I ordered him on the way home and it arrived a few days later.My son was overjoyed when on his birthday he unwrapped the king.  I am now looking at archers for Christmas.  The only down side to this range is having to buy the horse and rider separately - it would be useful to have a multibuy offer on them."
6290,2021,5," Exactly as advertised.  Excellent detail.  Quick delivery.  Well packaged."
6291,2022,5," just what the boys wanted& fist class delivery before time said& good price cheers."
6292,2023,3," The toy was for a present. The only complaint I had was that the box arrived filthy. A bit disappointed"
6293,2023,5," Really compliments the castle and knights for my grandson. He loves it!"
6294,2023,5," great addition to my mike the knight collection"
6295,2024,5," My son loves this item."
6296,2024,5," Good"
6297,2025,4," Bought for my son. He loves these figures and plays with them all the time. A lot of work had gone into creating these figures with a lot if detail."
6298,2025,5," A 1&  Excellent.What every little boy wants&  I get them for my grandson Freddie& he is into knights and pirates& at the moment."
6299,2025,5," Grandson loves these figures. Great detail."
6300,2025,5," great"
6301,2026,5," A 1&  Excellent.What every little boy wants& a reallyScary character& I get them for my grandson Freddie& he is into knights and pirates& at the moment."
6302,2026,4," Good quality toy but sword broken on arrival. Rather expensive but very few people make these so it had to be paid. I expect a happy little boy on Christmas morning."
6303,2026,5," Good"
6304,2027,5," Overall very good product& just what I wanted for a fancy dress party.Only slight criticism would be that the item under the cloak could have been more realistic."
6305,2028,5," Great gift for grandchild."
6306,2028,5," Great quality as always"
6307,2029,5," Bought toy for grandson to go with existing castle set up.  Child thought it was great as the cannon really fires!!!"
6308,2029,4," It was chosen for a Christmas present as requested. As yet the person concerned hasn't opened it. I'm sure it will be well played with."
6309,2029,5," Value for money& gift for a small child."
6310,2030,5," Perfect addition to the collection"
6311,2031,5," The War Griffin is great.  Very solid& robust and well painted.  My son loves it.  Papo do have a bit of a problem with making figures that ride their mounts well though.  This one is better than some of their others& but is still not really a convincing fit& not that my son seems to mind.  Thought it was a bit pricey& but glad to have bought it in the end as it is providing many hours of fun."
6312,2031,5," Surpised at the size of this one. Â£30 with a high street toy store. Excellent buy."
6313,2031,5," Excellent figure& great detail"
6314,2031,5," Fab toy"
6315,2032,4," It looks ok  it's a Christmas present for my son so we will see how likes it."
6316,2033,5," This is excellent& it arrived quickly and looks amazing. I'm going to give it to my son for Christmas and he'll love it. I have also ordered a few others from the range and they are all as good as this one."
6317,2033,5," I bought this because of my love of fantasy creatures and I've gotta say& I'm incredibly pleased with it. The figure is incredibly detailed down to each individual scale& patterning on the weapons and folds in the clothing. It is also well painted& very sturdy and has a good weight to it. Overall& it was definitely a good buy."
6318,2033,4," i have this on my shelf along with other things and it looks great and im very happy with it"
6319,2033,5," This was chosen by my son along with other papo items as part of his birthday present& he is pleased and hasn't stopped playing with them& they are durable and each character is interesting and unique."
6320,2033,5," Whilst a little on the pricey side&I don't think you can deny the quality of the figure. Can't wait till the grand son is old enough to play with them...we should of amassed quite an army by then!"
6321,2034,5," brought to go with my sons castle for his 3rd birthday and he loves it& good heavy duty material& just wish they came better presented"
6322,2034,4," Really lovely Horse but didn't overly last a long time. My son possibly a bit too young to have something as delicate as this. Purchased for his 5th birthday. Quite small for the price too but think before you buy as are delicate."
6323,2034,5," Excellent value for money. Lovely detail& sturdy and nicely finished off."
6324,2034,5," Speedy delivery and quality product& thanks."
6325,2034,5," Perfect addition to the collection"
6326,2035,5," fab horse and belongs to knight bull&the horse stands on 4 legs and also on 2 in rear&great quality and very well painted& iam very impressed and very sturdy to& would again recommend"
6327,2035,5," our grandson seems to be starting a collection of these models so will probably be ordering more ie christmas time etc"
6328,2035,5," Birthday present"
6329,2036,5," Great post& packing"
6330,2036,4," Good molding of of all the figures."
6331,2036,5," bought this model and others as a present for my 70yr old Father& so I wouldnt call it a toy exactly. definately not suitable for kids& or those with failing eyesight& as they are very detailed& and require a lot of patience. If he does it right it should be an excellent display piece."
6332,2037,5," All good as described."
6333,2037,5," Love him"
6334,2038,5," Bought a couple of these for my grandsons for Christmas as they both love Playmobil. The toys themselves are always good value as they are so well made and detailed and will last forever& but my grandsons also loved the little carry cases& which they use as 'secret agent' brief cases& so it was almost like two presents in one!"
6335,2038,5," I love these sets. The cases are perfect to keep the bits together. Great for traveling and hours of fun for children. I will buy more."
6336,2038,5," Great little dragon knight and the case is great as it holds loads of other bits as well"
6337,2038,5," This was a real hit with my son& he is not quite 3 1/2 but is able to handle all pieces."
6338,2038,5," for santa claus& no result yet& looks good"
6339,2038,4," My wee nephew loves it fast delivery"
6340,2038,5," great & fast delivery"
6341,2038,5," Great gift for a boy"
6342,2039,5," The little boy I bought this for is going to love it.  He's going through a massive knights and castles phase at the moment and this is so detailed and it has a sword.  I feel like I can't fail."
6343,2039,5," This is just another one i have bought love them any child would love them."
6344,2040,5," Bought as a present for my 5yr old nephew& very happy& would definitely recommend&  my nephew loves it."
6345,2040,5," A cracking item& was bought for my 7 year old nephew and when got it thought it felt very light and couldn't be much to it because it weighed nothing and box just rattled& but to my surprise when we built it& it looked great. Would recommend this item for other kids as they will love it."
6346,2040,5," My nephew is really happy with the Dragon Battle Ship :)"
6347,2040,5," As usual& great quality from playmobil& added to my 4 year old boys collection he loves playing with& as does his 7 year old sister.Arrived well packed and promptly"
6348,2040,5," Solidly built& fun toy appreciated by both 6 and 3 year-old. Good value. Delivered very quickly."
6349,2040,5," Great item& my grandson loves it as he does aWith all his playmobiile stuff."
6350,2040,4," Bought for grandson age 4 really liked it"
6351,2040,4," good quality and my grandson delighted"
6352,2041,5," I gave this toy 4 stars for educational value. Why? Because it's got a working catapult! Lots of fun with physics& aiming& ballistics& the works. And the laser crossbow thing is pretty cool too."
6353,2041,5," Bought this for a 4 year old to go with the set his parents bought him for his birthday.  It went down a treat by all accounts."
6354,2041,5," My 8yr old son loves it - complements his other Playmobil Dragon castle and men. As usual well made."
6355,2042,4," This 'Shrek-a-like' playmobil troll is the usual good quality that you'd expect from this range of toys& but it wasn't greeted with as much enthusiasm by my son as some other sets. It still gets played with& but not as much as other Playmobil things.  The dwarf guards are bit smaller and chubbier the usual playmobil people& which adds a bit of interest& and you do get a few accessories.  so it's a pretty good set& but not the very best in my view."
6356,2042,5," I bought this as thank you for my son who helped me out with some work around the house.  He was thrilled to bits.  As usual Amazon's price was fantastic.  This gets a lot of play out of it& both from my 9yr old& and my 3yr old."
6357,2042,5," Great set for a knight and troll lover."
6358,2042,4," A perfect addition for my son to add to his castle.Usual solid and very tough playmobil quality!"
6359,2042,5," Love playmobil. My children love it too. A good addition to my son's set."
6360,2042,5," Bought as christmas present but sure it will be loved. Fast delivery"
6361,2042,5," My son has had great fun playing with this set - great buy."
6362,2042,5," 3yr old grandson loves this with his playmobil castle"
6363,2043,5," This is a another great toy from Fisher Price. This ogre is just over 25cm (10 inches) tall. At the bottom of the ogre's foot there is a human shaped indent into which an Imaginext figure can be pushed into giving the impression the ogre has stamped on his enemy. On the ogre's back is a handle with a trigger which if squeezed will make the ogre raise both his arms and roar/moan. This ogre can interact with the Fisher Price Imaginext Castle& if you pull the trigger anywhere near the castle a knight's voice will shout |ogre& is that all you've got| and |he's in a bad mood|. For the sound effects to work this ogre requires 2 AAA batteries which have so far lasted over 2 months. This toy is robust and has taken a beating from my 6 year old and my 3 year old. Please click on this link if you wish to see the castle that interacts with this toy. Imaginext Castle"
6364,2043,5," Arrived quickly& original packaging& brand new. Great addition to the imaginext castle. Don't know why they don't stock it in the UK. 3 and 5 yr olds love it. They do hit each other with the club& but it is all still working no broken bits yet very robust."
6365,2043,5," My boy LOVES this! And it's TOUGH - which is very neccessary! Thanks for a great& sturdy toy :o)"
6366,2043,5," A major hit for my 3 year old'a birthday& quite robust and large and good value too."
6367,2043,2," Ogre is good itself& but at the time I purchased it it wasn't widely available and was nearly Â£50. This is a rip off in comparison to the Â£18 you can now get it for. So not very happy."
6368,2043,5," great toy as expected from Fisher Price& bit pricey but I'm sure my Grandson will love this new addition to his castle. Company provided very swift delivery!"
6369,2043,5," Bought this for my 5 year old boy.  He loves it and the Ogre interacts with his castle. Arrived in excellent condition and on time."
6370,2043,5," Brillian!  My son loves it& and I loved the price. Bigger than I thought it would be but that makes it even better"
6371,2044,5," Just as described. & yet it's a little piece of Magic in the hands of a child."
6372,2044,3," Have not opened it but it does not appear to be English and was disappointed that the name Christopher was not very obvious on the package as I had bought it as a gift for a little boy with the same name. Seems expensive for what you get"
6373,2045,5," Being 30 something and having no children myself i remember playmobil as a child so I didn't realise it was still around& so I took to Amazon as always to search for it when my friend said my 6 year old god son wanted some for Christmas. He already has some other playmobil items to do with knights so after having a look at a few sets I settled on this one.  As ever Amazon could not be beaten on price as I saw this set for a whooping Â£22.00 in a local toy shop so I was happy with the price I paid for the item.  Now on to the recipient .... As he unwrapped it he let out a squeal of delight which I took to mean he liked his present ... ALOT! The items were easy to put together with him only needing help to stick the stickers on with him up and ready for battle within 10 minutes. All in all the Lion knight treasure transport was a huge success! Well done playmobil and of course the ever reliable Amazon& what would I do without you! :-D"
6374,2045,5," I have a mad playmobil fan.. They saw this in a shop a while ago.. So waited to see what 'santa' would bring... They were so pleased when they opened this! Didnt have to spend ages building& however some of the parts are quite small so had to make sure they were all kept together!"
6375,2045,3," My son chose to buy this with his birthday money and it has been a hit.  He has got a lot of play from it so far and it still looks immaculate - testament to the excellent Playmobil quality and attention to detail.  It has stood up well to some heavy handed playing from my 3 year old.From my point of view& I think that it is expensive for what it is.  Also& it does come with some very small bits (the treasure pieces are absolutely tiny and a nightmare to keep track of& as are the various bits of armour and weaponry on the knights).  Finally& the cannon doesn't seem to work that well (or maybe it is just beyond me!)  Little niggles& but I don't think this is one of the better Playmobil sets.Overall& I think this will please the kids but cause some frustration for parents!"
6376,2045,5," My grandson has enjoyed playing with my son's old Playmobile and was over the moon to receive his own new set. The toys are always well crafted and so full of detail. They encourage imaginative play. I will be buying more."
6377,2045,3," Like all Playmobil stuff& quite expensive. Myself I don't quite see the point of Lego in this form. I always thought Lego was for using your imagination"
6378,2045,5," To be honest I havent seen the purchase ... I had it sent straight to my nephew in the UK.  So my stars are due to the fact that it got their for his birthday and he loves the present!!"
6379,2045,4," This item was sent for as it was requested for as a Christmas present. Santa hasn't done his deliveries yet but& I expect it will be just what was wanted."
6380,2045,4," The toy was received well.A good buy.The items were easy to put together. The only needing help to stick the stickers on the treasure transport ."
6381,2046,5," Good alternative or addition to the usual chocolate Easter egg& usual Playmobil quality and efficient delivery& the children loved the extra treat!"
6382,2046,5," Fab alternative to a chocolate egg and these Play Mobile eggs kept the kids happy"
6383,2046,5," Grandson will love this as he loves his knights and castle"
6384,2047,5," i was very impressed with knight bull&great quality and very well painted and durable&i will be buying more.Ben will love it when his birthday arrives i feel sure.i would highly recommend."
6385,2047,5," well made product and our grandchildren certaintly have a facination with them. probably be ordering more in future. a good buy."
6386,2047,5," Really good delivery and the toy itself is sturdy and has really good detail on it& my four year old boy loves it"
6387,2047,5," Birthday present"
6388,2048,5," This is an amazing castle love it.  My 5 year old was thrilled with it.  The quality is excellent and although it took over an hour to bulid it initially it is great.  The colours and details are great.  It was delivered promptly and was well packaged and the price was the best in the market.  Highly recommended"
6389,2048,5," This Playmobil Castle is fantastic. We got it for my son who is 3 and he absolutely loves it. It is far and away his favourite toy and he spends a lot of time playing with it. It is well built and will last which is great these days. It is large and you need a fair bit of space to play with it as you need to access it from every side for the best play experience. I thoroughly recommend this product as it provides hours of fun and the children rarely seem to get bored of it."
6390,2048,5," Great castle. Huge box and huge castle. Takes some time to build. A lot of figures& a lot of features like secret passage& main gates opening& wall tearing down. If you have about a sq meter to have it at home& it's great!"
6391,2048,5," Fantastic castle really worth the money it's s very sturdy castle and has provided lots of fun for our two boys. Don't underestimate the 1 hour needed to contstruct!"
6392,2048,5," Arrived promptly and as described&  be prepared to spend several hours constructing this in advance& playmobil is a great toy and my six year old loves this castle and the knights of which he has a number&  well worth getting for hours of fun and battles&  I always loose but I love it too& Dad!"
6393,2048,5," This playmobil set is alot larger than I expected which is fantastic!!! So easy to put together and very durable.  My 5 year old son loves it and because it is quite large it is easier to play with not like some other brands which are fiddly and hard to play with.  Highly recommended."
6394,2048,5," This was my nine year old's main Christmas present this year and he has not stopped playing with it.There are so many features and hidden extras that draw his attention for hours.Although it took a little time to put together on Christmas Day this was half the fun."
6395,2048,5," My 3 year old loves this...I will however be gluing the pieces together as a heavy handed 3 year old can break it apart far too easily! This is a massive toy& just to forewarn anyone else buying it! I hadn't appreciated the size of it! But I can see how this will grow with my son!"
6396,2049,5," As pictured. Just what my son wanted."
6397,2049,5," Great quality as always"
6398,2050,5," This is such a wonderful dragon castle& complete with warrior figures& red dragon& catapult& trap door and skeleton! My nephew (aged 5) absolutely loved this for his birthday and has spent many hours playing with it. It isn't cheap but it is very well made and feels very robust and durable. It is also easy to put together and quite substantial& making it an impressive toy in any child's bedroom!I thoroughly recommend this toy - it is perfect for imaginative play."
6399,2050,5," Playmobil as a classic favourite is hard to beat.  This set provides the scene for endless imaginative play& with exciting traps and dungeons to explore.  Some dragon fights have resulted in loss of limbs and jaws (of the dragons) but nothing that isn't promptly regenerated.  The only downside is the price& but the incredible reputation of Playmobil durability mitigates this to an extent."
6400,2050,4," Grandchildren like it had some good hours of fun playing with it and seems to be very durable& some small pieces to be careful with."
6401,2050,4," Its big and got some fun functions like the trapdoor. Also alot of |Playmo-men| was included& my son is very happy with it!"
6402,2050,5," Dragon - check.  Castle - check.  Knights - check.  Miscellanous weaponry - check.  Playmobil quality - check.  Let mayhem and destruction ensue.Brought this over two years ago for my then 7 year old dragon and knights mad daughter along with a myriad of other playmobil knights and dragons (Dragon Dungeon& Red Dragon& etc).  Two years later its still standing and she's still playing with it all.  The envy of any of her firends who come around who are also in to knights& dragons and castles - mainly boys :-(.As always with Playmobil it's not cheap but you cannot fault the quality and attention to detail.  All in all for any budding knights& dragons or High Overlords a good buy."
6403,2050,5," Really great but need time to put together& my advice would be to assemble first . My grandson loves it. Well worth it."
6404,2051,5," Loved the figure& got to collect all 4 categories."
6405,2052,5," Sales person was very quick to reply& and dispatch the packageHe also made sure I could buy outside UK!The model kit is good& a bit hard and one needs a good amount of time to build it. (But that was the idea)& as a hobby and to calm down& excelent! The set itself& easy instructions without words& explanes good."
6406,2053,5," Given as a birthday gift for an artistic five year old boy& who spent an afternoon with his sister painting it a sluggish orange with green streaks. If his previous work is anything to go by& over the next few weeks it will gradually acquire a think film of stickers& scraps of paper& feathers& lumps of glitter glue and more paint. It's the perfect size for Playmobil pirates& and a damn sight less expensive and more creative than their click-together fortresses.I didn't personally assemble this one& but I did put together the treehouse model& and it went together in minutes."
6407,2053,5," A hit - my 5 yr old son loved painting the fortress and then playing with it"
6408,2054,5," I bought a bunch of these Schleich knights for my son's fourth birthday. He loves them and plays with them constantly. They're good quality and robust enough for a bit of rough play. Delivery arrived on time and in perfect order."
6409,2054,5," I bought this for a friend's little boy who is really into Merlin& knights and castles.  I am delighted with it.  It is sturdy& no crude moulding and painted well.  He will love it to play with and as an ornament in his bedroom."
6410,2054,3," Got this toy well wrapped but when opened the presentation box the Knight came on was ripped and part of the lance was in the Knights hand and not fastened onto the box. It didn't say second hand when purchased."
6411,2054,5," The knight was well made and painted and no problem with it standing up right.Detail on the  knight was brillant."
6412,2054,5," i know quite expensive&but wait till you see this knight&so life like and very durable will stand a lot of hard playing&quite tall in height to& well worth the money&i would highly recommend.thanks amazon for a very quick and free delivery"
6413,2055,5," My three years old grandson loves the |Knights| range of figures. They are robust and well made."
6414,2055,5," My nephew played for hours with this&very good value for money"
6415,2055,5," Bought for my 4 year old nephew instead of an Easter egg and he loved it. This Knight was soon with all the others taking part in a massive battle."
6416,2055,5," Everything I have bought recently are for my grandsons b/days. All top quality& very happy indeed. Thank you"
6417,2056,5," Well made& realistic knight although in same pose as Hospitaler Knight until sword / shield swapped over. A good addition to my grandson's red army!jamesfrancis"
6418,2056,5," I order these for a friend and he is delighted with them"
6419,2056,5," Excellent figures and early delivery& will buy again"
6420,2056,5," Grandson loved it."
6421,2056,5," Thank you"
6422,2057,5," WOW! This T-Rex toy arrived today and it is amazing! It is a birthday present for my nephews 5th birthday....but now i wanna keep it! LOL. It is a highly detailed model with a moving jaw& even the inside of the mouth and soft palette are sculpted& its well made and sturdy....if this is the Papo standard i'll definately be getting more of their 'toys'."
6423,2057,5," Wow! I bought this along with the standing model& they work really well together indeed. I do love this model slightly more due to it's exciting pose& it's fantastic paint job& and attention to detail with the sculpt. Every scale and vein is artistically worked into this piece& and it looks amazing from every angle& even down to the detail on the bottom of the feet. The teeth are great& they are irregular and realistic& as I imagine a real t-rex's teeth would be after chomping on a few triceratops! I would recommend this for all dinosaur fans& a must have model if you like t-rex!"
6424,2057,5," My wife looked it over and asked me how much I'd paid for it. I was very happy to tell her& and her response was |Really? Wow!|  (Â£17.04) The structure and detail in the modeling and paintwork is extremely satisfying. I bought it as reference for some artwork& and it provides everything I wanted. The jaw opens and closes& and they've included the cheek skin exposed when the mouth is open& along with a thoroughly convincing tongue.  I can go ahead and nit pick: the angle of the impression of the ribs under the skin is a little bit off to my eye& but the angle they have chosen and some skin swags they've crafted work together in an aesthetically pleasing manner. They've gone for musclar arms and developed pectorals& which harmonize well with the rest of the body. Detail everywhere& while maintaining a consistent& well posed overall model. It stands without assistance. Only the lower jaw moves."
6425,2057,5," Very realistic and quite heavy. I bought it for Photography wedding shots to add something different to the normal group shots..."
6426,2057,5," There are so many amazing things about this prduct& The details are out of this world! the design is magnificant. Many would think that this is the T-Rex from Jurassic Park"
6427,2057,5," I bought this& along with a triceratops and a stegosaurus for my son for Christmas. After looking online and reading many reviews I chose papo dinosaurs as they get great reviews and are very reasonably priced.  My son will love these on Christmas morning. Fantastic service from Amazon."
6428,2057,5," Bought this for our son for his 4th birthday. He's had others that I've found to be a bit brittle - losing a toe or the end of a tail in a fight! This one seems to be a little more rubbery and flexible so hopefully the same won't happen. It looks great& better than in the picture."
6429,2057,5," The level of detail of these Papo sculpts still astounds me.Their competitors Schleich should be ashamed.I'm always impressed by the paint jobs on the Papo products and in comparison equally disappointed by the Schleich products.Go for Papo every time."
6430,2058,4," My nephews have a lot of imaginext toys (the castle& dragon& various knights etc) but this particular knight was unusual as the only others I had found were 'good knights'. Reasonable price for imaginext (not the cheapest of brands anyway) and prompt delivery. Would recommend."
6431,2059,5," I have purchased these for my twin grandchildren who will be four this month.  I am sure they will love playing with them as I have also bought a castle to go with them so I'm sure their imaginations will run riot!"
6432,2059,5," Speedy delivery and well packaged. All limbs are bendable and the costumes are really cute. The cost was lower than some I have seen that were not as nice."
6433,2059,5," Great wooden set & goes well with the Heritage Fairy Tale doll set & fun for tots and granddad too"
6434,2059,5," Very pleased with these model figures. Well made and colourful costumes.Daisy"
6435,2059,5," Goes so well with the Castle our grandkids play with. Lots of stories to invent."
6436,2060,5," cant tell you how much the children love these toys&well painted&so life like&good quality and durable.i would highly recommend&both children have got papo toys for there birthdays this year&there view (wow and cool)"
6437,2060,5," Bother king Richard figure and horse I would give a five star rating against detail and quality"
6438,2060,5," i love horses and history& lives on my book shelf."
6439,2061,5," As you'd expect from playmobil& a quality product that my sons love playing with. Good detail and well made& will last for years and will no doubt be passed down at some point."
6440,2061,3," It was a birthday gift.  Didn't arf shake around in the box& poor boy must of thought this ones already broken without even opening it. Would of like to of seen more packaging inside the toy box to disguise the sound of rattling plastic"
6441,2061,5," Purchased these to go along with the castle we have purchased. It's the usual high standard with playmobil and the attention to details. Good value for money. You can't go wrong with playmobil& safe& strong& and good value."
6442,2061,5," What's not to like about Playmobil?  This is a Christmas present& and  I'm sure it'll be well-received.  Packaging adequate.  Arrived 2 days late& but I'll put that down to made pre-Christmas rush"
6443,2061,5," As good as I hoped it would be"
6444,2061,5," My grandson was thrilled with his present which came very quickly considering that I ordered it very close to Christmas."
6445,2061,4," Little boy loves these! Added to his playmobil Castle.OftenFiddly to put together but worth it."
6446,2061,5," Brilliant and really good value for money"
6447,2062,5," Beautifully painted& high quality figures. I don't want to give them to my son. I want to keep them myself."
6448,2062,5," Great quality as always"
6449,2063,5," This is great item.  Make fabulous presents as is a substanial and complete toy. Fast delivery and good service.  They are excelletn quality toys and a huge hit with the 5year olds that have received them as birthday presents.  Would recommend this item"
6450,2063,4," This is a small set - you don't really get much for your money& however my son loved it as not only can he carry a few knights out and about& but it also provides and extra 'base' for role play games. Good quality& as would be expected from Playmobil"
6451,2063,4," There isn't much to this toy and it isn't that cheap but as a bundle with other Playmobil castle items it ticked the box for a castle that could be under siege and the boys love the cannon. The raven falls off a lot though which gets a bit annoying."
6452,2064,5," Given as birthday present to my 3 years old.He loved it.It took 10 - 15 minutes to build& quite easy& and very well made as always with playmobil.It's played everyday since. A good buy !"
6453,2064,5," EPIC is the word we got. As always with playmobil the level of detail is amazing. Good value for money& enough room for the kids to play and gain access to the castle. Nice touches with the |broken wall|. Easy to build& but if buying as a pressie expect 15-25 mins build time. I found the playmobil tool hurt my fingers more than assist me. Still got the job done. BTW the castle is sturdy enough to move around when built-as in it does'nt just full apart as soon as you lift off the ground. Great value and Great fun!!"
6454,2064,5," Really pleased with this item&  bought for my son for Christmas.... especially good as it was half price!  Well made and easy to put together. .. holds really well together despite some negative comments I have read. Very good quality.  The only problem I have had is getting the catapult to work. ... Probably some simple solution.  Overall extremely pleased with this item! Have realised from the box that you can buy extra bits of wall to make the castle bigger. .. Will definitely be looking to do that."
6455,2064,5," Amazing service the package arrived sooner than expected and was excellently packaged. I am very pleased with this purchase excellent value and fantastic delivery!"
6456,2064,5," We love it! Proprietary tool/fixings used for assembly was a bit of a surprise& but works well. Already planning the extension."
6457,2064,4," Good quality castle& bought for my daughter as a birthday present and she likes it because it is more like the castles we have visited rather than the fairy castles Playmobil also make& a touch over priced so try and buy when it goes on offer& but you know it will last for years and years due to Playmobil's quality"
6458,2064,5," Can't think of a bad thing to say about this set. It was really fun and satisfying to build and the instructions were nice and clear. Once built it's sturdy and you can move it all as one piece. The little touches like the flags and the torches on the front make it look fantastic.My 8 year old daughter has had an absolute blast with it& even her 11 year old brother who declares himself far too old for Playmobil couldn't resist joining in.There is a little lever that opens a trap door when you need to drop |naughty knights| into the dungeon which she loves& There is one secret panel in the wall that pops off for knights to get in and out of the castle in secret. It comes with 3 knights which is more than enough to get you started and loads of little accessories like helmets and axes to mess around with. The horse with it's armour was a big hit too.All in all you get a load of good solid Playmobil for your money& I would definitely recommend."
6459,2064,5," Excellent set&  my son loves it. So many movable parts.  Cannot recommend enough&  made to the usual playmobil production standards. Castle walls break down and pull apart so you can vary the play setup."
6460,2065,5," Fantastic"
6461,2066,5," We're going to use this item for kids and it's a good product."
6462,2066,5," grandson collects the figures and was thrilled by this one"
6463,2067,5," Excellent figure& great detail"
6464,2068,2," Unfortunately this knight didn't last even the day. The shield came off and the sword snapped within a couple of hours.  This is a big disappointment and we will be looking at other brands in future."
6465,2068,5," brought to go with my sons castle for his 3rd birthday and he loves it& good heavy duty material& just wish they came better presented"
6466,2068,5," Arrived early new and lovely. My son will love it! Hours and hours of fun to be had& playing with all his little figures."
6467,2069,4," Our grandson loved it& the only thing I would say&the helmet was slightly to big.Overall great value"
6468,2070,4," This horse and knight looks great and was delivered very fast- My 9 year old hadn't had it long when the knight stopped exploding but it still look great in his room"
6469,2070,4," Didn't see a scale size anywhere so was surprised buy the size."
6470,2071,4," This product goes really well with the Playmobil castle. My Grandson loves it. It was bought for his birthday last year and is still going strong. Good quality and good value for money."
6471,2071,5," Theses were bought to oppose the lion knights. The gun is excellent. Easy to assemble and even my 21 month grandson can shoot the bullets. Great fun!"
6472,2071,5," All my son wants& more than anything& is to be a knight and have a castle. Then... To fight to save that castle. This toy had bought him much delight and even at 3 he is able to work it all himself."
6473,2071,5," Fantastic toy my little one spends hours playing with it great value for money well recommended super quick delivery couldn't ask for more."
6474,2071,5," Very good value - the best I could find.The firing crossbow is excellent toy.It is a good combination with Falcon Castle."
6475,2071,5," this toy is manageable for children  from aged 4 onwards 'i would recommend it for use with other playlobil  toys"
6476,2071,4," had hours of fun from minutes of opening ordered loads of other assortments over time and will do again ."
6477,2072,4," The Caesar figure is very well made& as one finds Schleich figures to be.  I use it with the children to play soldiers& for re-enacting battles etc.  They are only young but enjoy the concept of soldiers of different eras and have an understanding of the periods of history.  The Caesar figure is well detailed and the children have a good understanding of the Roman period of history.  I am pleased with this purchase& as I am with all of my historical Schleich figures."
6478,2072,4," exactly as described - very satisfied"
6479,2073,5," When I saw this item I knew my child would love it.It has good detail and looks great.My kids have used similar products (a year) and they are still in one peace. However weapons have broken but still usable.The paint wares off especially on the weapons after some time but that is due to kids putting it in the mouth.The magnet addition to hold rider down is spot on as they play it stays in place.My kids love it"
6480,2073,4," a good sturdy product that the children get much joy from& not cheap but somethings are worth paying for i think."
6481,2073,5," new knight great detail. the kids are going have lot of fun with there new world of knights and fantasy"
6482,2073,5," I bought this for my 8 year-old grandson.  It is very well made and detailed and he loves it."
6483,2074,5," An absolute winner with 3yr old boys."
6484,2074,5," Brilliant"
6485,2074,5," Thankyou"
6486,2075,5," Another Great toy from this reliable brand. It is well made and suitably detailed - refreshing in these days of many mass produced items"
6487,2075,5," Beautifully painted& high quality figures. I don't want to give them to my son. I want to keep them myself."
6488,2076,5," Excellent company to deal with goods as described and excellent value for money would recommend to friends and family no complaints at all"
6489,2077,5," Just what I wanted"
6490,2078,5," bought this model and others as a present for my 70yr old Father& so I wouldnt call it a toy exactly. definately not suitable for kids& or those with failing eyesight& as they are very detailed& and require a lot of patience. If he does it right it should be an excellent display piece."
6491,2079,5," Great toy. Really good quality. Wings flap when it's moved through the air holding the handle. Squeeze the handle and it chomps down - can grab small toys in front of it. My boys love it! Good value too."
6492,2079,5," Great product& works really well with the castle - worth having both together albeit a pricey package"
6493,2080,5," What every little boy wants& I get them for my grandson Freddie& he is into knights and pirates& at the moment."
6494,2080,4," exactly as imagined it would be and perfect present for grandson"
6495,2080,5," Lovely"
6496,2081,5," I bought this for my grandson when he was 7. He loved it and it was easy to assemble. Rather expensive& but a good quality product."
6497,2081,4," I would love this but my daughter (aged 2) has already managed to break one of the link posts.Other than that it is a fabulous castle and has been enjoyed very much by the children- it has seen battles and royals- it has been an animal palace and a playground for our tortoise-- it is bigger than I was expecting and I have added a scenery mat underneath but it really is fabulous"
6498,2081,5," This is just beautiful. So sturdy& so easy to put together& so solid and such a wonderful toy for children of all ages. At full price it makes me wince a little and I did buy it on sale& but it would be worth it no matter the cost."
6499,2081,5," This is a great item& my little boy is going to love it! Excellent quality& well made and a bargain for the price I paid (heavily discounted& on sale). Very pleased!"
6500,2081,5," Bought this on a flash amazon prime sale. Not put it up yet but it looks great."
6501,2082,5," Taking it as a present for my 4 yr old grandson who loves his collection of knights on horseback.  Great finish and colourful.  Definitely up to Schleich's normally great finish and quality."
6502,2082,5," Wow fantastic quality& will be buying more for my 3 year old son !"
6503,2082,5," Really great toy - my son loves playing with it and it is ones of his favourite Christmas presents"
6504,2082,5," Lovely item. Quality as you expect from Schleich."
6505,2083,5," Ibought this item to go along with the magic castle&i have to be honest this is all my grandaghter has played with since christmas&so therefore i would give this item a big thumbs up."
6506,2084,5," My girls (5 and 6) love doing sticky mosaics. I have bought them a variety over the last couple of years and they have provided hours of amusement and are now being bought for friends' birthdays to introduce them to the delight of these mosaics. I find keeping a spare one or two in reserve helps for long ferry / train journeys etc."
6507,2084,5," These are brilliant. Bought many for Christmas presents. Thirteen and fourteen pounds seems expensive& and It is really - but my children loved them. Good quality - probably get 8-10 hours worth of play/create time out of the whole box. Highly recommend."
6508,2084,5," These mosaics kept our 4 years old granddaughter amused for hours. Much less messy than painting by numbers but the same principle. What was nice is that she could stand the picture up once she had finished it.  Well worth every penny."
6509,2084,5," My granddaughter loved these and she has lots of others too. Will definately buy for presents as the end product are lovely."
6510,2085,5," Given to my son for his 2nd birthday - he loves it - it is really well made.Goes really well with the rest of the characters"
6511,2085,5," lovely little play set and would probably suit a competent 2-2/12 yr old too as any younger the pieces are pointed plastic but too much older than 3-4 they may get bored depending if they're already past little plastic characters and into building lego etc!"
6512,2085,5," Got this at a great price.  The children love the toy and have it with toy castle and other accessories.  Good quality and well worth the money.  It came well packaged and quickly&"
6513,2085,5," Paid what I believe these figures should cost. Argos are Â£9.99 and I think thats ridiculous.  Not opened yet as for christmas but looks really nice"
6514,2085,5," My son loves this Mike the Knight figure& I brought it decorate a cake and is played with all the time now! Fast postage"
6515,2085,5," My 22 month old son absolutely loves this and wouldn't let go of it. Its perfect for tiny hands going out and about."
6516,2085,5," Yet another hit with my grandson as it works well with his castle and parts move.Good value for the money"
6517,2085,5," Love it&  Again this is for Xmas and will go down a teat with a toddler."
6518,2086,3," This is basically a stencil with some princesses on.  It comes with a base and about 15 sheets of white paper for you to put between the stencil and base.  There are also three colour pencils and one black fine-tipped pen.  Oh& and a huge plastic support to fill the rest of the box.A good buy if you have a princess-obsessed child& but don't buy it as a main present because you'll open the box and think |Is that it?|  Quite disppointing."
6519,2086,5," Something a little different for a girl who loves princesses and has most things. Easy to use and patterns can be made without repeating the same thing everytime. Well worth the money!"
6520,2086,5," Five year old grand-daughter thoroughly enjoyed using this as soon as she was given it at Christmas. I was worried that it would be a bit hard for her but she produced some good pictures and will obviously improve with practice."
6521,2086,2," This was a disappointing purchase& not for my daughter who loves anything with princesses on it& but for me. A piece of plastic a pen and some sheets of paper not what I had envisaged. Very regretful purchase"
6522,2086,5," I bought two of these as a christmas present for my neices&who began drawing and colouring  as soon as they had opened it. A good set to keep children entertained and occupied at a reasonable price."
6523,2086,5," I bought this as a present for my son's friend& who is 7.  As far as I know& she is pleased with it but haven't had much feedback so can't really comment further."
6524,2086,3," Got this as a gift for a friends girl. Mine already has the original mandala designer and she loves it. Has been asking for one of these too !"
6525,2086,4," Purchased for my daughters friends (age 6) birthday present& received within 2 days. She enjoys designing& colouring and being creative."
6526,2087,5," I bought this for my son who is 3.  I didn't think it looked very impressive from the pictures shown on Amazon& but he wanted a landscape to use with his Playmobil dragon knights.  Given it was reasonably priced& I decided to try it.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  Dragon rock is a dragon - it has an opening mouth that conceals a shield& complete with sparkling jewel& and a wing that moves to reveal a dragon knight sword.  The quest becomes hunting for this treasure.  The two knights are& like others of their type& beautifully made and dressed.  The only annoying thing is having to stick the 'lava' stickers on& but this was relatively painless.  It's a great purchase for the price.  We have got the Dragon Knight's Castle for Christmas after being so impressed with Playmobil dragon knights so far.  I'll review that later!"
6527,2087,5," The toy was exactly what I wanted. Great. Thanks.  It was a present for a friend's little boy and he loved it and played with it for ages."
6528,2087,5," My 6 year old was very lucky to receive this from one of his friends& it's good quality and one of his favorites."
6529,2087,5," good toy"
6530,2088,5," A wonderfully toyetic alternative to S.H. Figuarts. I had a blast."
6531,2088,5," Excellent"
6532,2089,5," This is a lovely addition to my daughters collection& which is beginning to build up. Have found the same though a bit cheaper in a shop in leek"
6533,2090,5," Beautifully painted& high quality figures. I don't want to give them to my son. I want to keep them myself."
6534,2091,5," I bought this product for my grandson who had just visited the Tower of Lodon and was very excited about medieval history& knights and jousting.  We both love it"
6535,2091,5," I bought knight and horse  so that my  eight year old Grandaughter can join in the play with her brother& who has so many Papo Knights.The detail is especially good& in a way quite good for a girl."
6536,2092,5," Ordered this to complete the set.Son loves it"
6537,2092,5," Can't go wrong with playmobil."
6538,2092,5," ðŸ‘ ðŸ‘"
6539,2093,5," as previously mentioned in another review&a bit small for my eyes these days&but superb models."
6540,2093,5," bought this model and others as a present for my 70yr old Father& so I wouldnt call it a toy exactly. definately not suitable for kids& or those with failing eyesight& as they are very detailed& and require a lot of patience. If he does it right it should be an excellent display piece."
6541,2093,4," Just what I wanted"
6542,2094,5," I bought this set at Cardiff castle and it is brilliant! 2 red horses& 4 red men& 2 blue horses& 4 blue men - perfect for 2 little boys to play with. Some of the pieces (shields& axes etc) can come out of the figures' hands and we've already lost and found one axe and one man! 2 horses (1 red& 1 blue) can be either in a normal running position or will stand up on their back legs without being held (due to the genius design of the Cape thing covering their backs). The little men all stand up by themselves or can ride on the horses - little details like that make for a really fun toy! I really think this is an excellent set! I know it's a bit pricey& but it does seem high quality and very well designed.Our boys (5 and 2) had had loads of fun playing with the bigger Papo figures on display in the castle's cafe so I was a bit worried they'd be slightly disappointed with the smaller version. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the size didn't seem to make any difference to them! They're also the perfect size to go with our boys' bucket and spade set for the beach. Sand castles& Knights and horses - how much fun is that!? We also travel a lot so small is good in that respect. Always good to have a few toys up your sleeves... And these fit perfectly. I highly recommend them!"
6543,2094,3," I knew they were small but I was surprised by HOW small. The whole container is a little bigger than the length of my hand (I'm 5.3). I haven t opened it yet as we are keeping it for holiday but the figures are smaller than my thumb although they appear to be well made. Nice bright colours. Delivery was by yodel and didn't really work for me as you have to arrange on line to pick them up if you miss delivery and the location is about 20 minutes away. Prefer Royal Mail."
6544,2094,5," Much better quality than expected& our son loves them. We will probably top up his collection at some point."
6545,2094,4," These are very small toy knights& but so long as they are what you need then they are nicely made toys. The knights sit well on their horses& and my son has hours of fun using them to tell stories and have adventures with his toy castle and a dragon that we bought at the same time. Great toys& but do check that this is the size you want as they really are small."
6546,2094,5," Brought for use in school. My kids love them."
6547,2094,4," Lovely figures& horses great and knights look cool. Vibrant and Different colours only thing was they were too small for my grandsons fort which was a shame ...should have read and taken note of sizes!"
6548,2094,5," Bought for 4yr old Grandson as part of a Christmas present. Product arrived before Christmas Day which was excellent. He absolutely loves the figures and will have hours of enjoyment with them."
6549,2094,3," This toy is for a gift for a 5 year old boy.  Looks very expensive for what it is as it comes in a tiny box. But really as I only have girls I wouldn't really know"
6550,2095,5," My six year old son loves these dragons (both sets). They are each individual and have their own names. They are not the biggest& but same size as his LEGO men so integrates well with them. We got him the skeleton army previously. He spends hours with them. They have so far managed to go with him to play& to bath and to bed without any trouble.The only downside is for those barefoot parents out there like myself - they hurt like blazes when stepped on in the middle of the night (but on the plus side have not broken yet as a result)."
6551,2095,5," My boys (age 3 and 5) got a tube of dragons each for Christmas and they love them. Great toy for using your imagination. Nice size for their little hands too."
6552,2095,5," does exactly as the description given& quick delivery"
6553,2096,5," Excellent product& knights& horses& soldiers& dragon and catapult are all made of wood& are well made and sturdy. All individually wrapped and in a decent box which can be used for storing the figures. My grandson is three years old and the best of the items was the catapult& after only a few minutes he had the hang of it and whilst we put the wooden balls to one side& screwed up pieces of paper were just as good and flew a good distance. All in all a very good purchase and matched up well with his castle. 26th December 2015."
6554,2097,5," This guy is fearsome - no one messes with him in the castle. Has successfully defended against the red knights for almost a year now& and not a scratch on him."
6555,2098,2," Djeco toys are usually really really good both in terms of quality and in terms of fun.  Unofrtunately this was a bit of a let down on both respects."
6556,2098,4," A tiny tad flimsy& but otherwise very good for my 4 year old daughter& who is being encouraged to hold a pen correctly"
6557,2098,5," My girl loves this and it is great to stencil and make lots of pictures to colour them and make a story by putting all the pictures together"
6558,2098,5," Very good. Excellent value for money and both myself and granddaughter enjoy stencilling on rainy days."
6559,2099,4," Son loves it."
6560,2100,5," We bought this castle for our almost 3yr old son. It has been a fantastic hit with him and his 5yr old sister!It is well made and easy to put together - just need to put in 4 screws and the rest just slots together (towers come ready made). The whole castle slots into grooves on the base board& so is nice and sturdy to play with.We chose this castle because of its size. It is plenty big enough for our son's imaginative play - hiding knights under the batlements& locking up baddies in the dungeon - whilst being small enough to sit on his chest of drawers or tuck away into a corner when not in use.It would be good if some knights were included but we bought Early Learning's knights and baddies which are great. Although our son also battles with Scooby Doo figures and fluffy toys!"
6561,2100,5," The castle arrived very quickly after i ordered it& the packaging was sufficient though the box was a little dented when it arrived but that's more the fault of the Royal Mail than the supplier!It would be good if the figures could be included in the castle or if the supplier could deal in appropriate figures because it was a bit of a nightmare getting the other half of this gift sorted but i got there in the end.The castle itself looked to be very high quality and extremely well made& the instructions to set it up were very clear and when the present was open& it was very well received& i would definitely recommend it to others!"
6562,2100,1," I really liked this item when it arrived& but my son knocked one if the interlocking pieces and the unfinished MDF dispersed.  MDF& of course& commonly contains formaldehyde. I emailed the company twice and they sent two long emails telling me that their MDF is perfectly safe but both times ignored my request to advise the level of formaldehyde in their MDF.  It seemed evasive that they ignored the question twice (they were not genric templated response emails) and so the item has been packed away. The MDF is unfinished in the joins and it dispersed after two days playing and so it will stay in storage until such a time as Le Toy is open and transparent in their use of MDF for childrens toys."
6563,2100,5," brilliant castle.  takes a while to construct initially ( a bit of screwing together)  so if its pressie recommend you construct it the night before!really good quality wooden toy and easy for a 3yr old to play with.  it doesnt come with the dragon and trebuchet pictured though.  ideal actually are the playmobil knights to go in it.  we ordered the van knights set and they were cute but tiny& and dont stand up---so they were not really appropriate for this castle which was a bit odd.all in all a great buy well worth it"
6564,2100,3," I bought this for my son thinking that once together I wouldn't have to re-assemble it. The castle does hold together fine until you want to move it - then it has a habit of falling to bits. It would be better if the bits that slot together actually hold together when moving it around the house.Otherwise it's well made and good fun - but nowhere near as sturdy as the doug and melissa princess castle we bought for my daughter which is practically bomb proof!"
6565,2100,5," This castle is superb& its sterdy and really provokes good immagination and fantasy for a child& great for parents to put together& because it has slots to put it together it only took a couple of minutes to get it up and playing. For all those who love battles& dragons and wizards. Go for it."
6566,2100,5," We had thought of getting a castle for my son for a while and were pondering between a lego castle or something like this.  This is an extremely good quality product for a fraction of the price of the lego or similar castles.  You can get fantastic papo figures to go with the product which are also excellent quality and a castle playmat is also available from papo to go with it.  Combined you can get all this for under the price of other castles and get a really good quality product.  We have brought this for my son for Christmas and we can't wait to all play with it!"
6567,2100,4," The castle is great for kids to use their imagination. My 2 boyslove playing with it and we add to their collection of knights& horsesand dragons to create a toy they will be able to keep for a long time.My only disappointment is the base which is not one solid pieceso it means we have to be careful when moving the castle. Weare planning to fix the castle ourselves to a solid base."
6568,2101,5," Arrived well packed and enjoyed by a 5 year old"
6569,2102,5," Good"
6570,2103,5," I love these figures &well made great value always arrives &well packed and on timeWould recommend to anyone"
6571,2103,5," lovely"
6572,2104,4," It's all right but I expected more staff and HQ's officers of diferent arms than too much soldiers of the line in guard dutty."
6573,2105,5," great product. little boy very happy"
6574,2106,5," Good sized interactive toy with lights& movement and sound. Plenty of little accessories"
6575,2106,5," There was great excitement when this arrived earlier. Both my children (ages almost 2 and 3 1/2) were immediately totally enthral led by it!The castle itself is of a really good size. Was quite surprised by how big it is!In the box& you will find:> the castle> lion> 2 guards> kings crown> crossbow> 6 discs> throne> 2 helmets> axes> shields> knightThe castle has noises and flashing lights. It can be attacked by the discs onto the shields to open the jaw and mane and to storm the castle. I think it's brilliant fun!!.... My daughters play with all sorts of games and we try not to box them into girl/boy toys. They also really like it. My almost two year old is a little young to play with it really although she loves the noises and lights.Overall& there are lots of features on this toy from making the lion leap out the castle& to trap doors& grabbing of invaders and shooting discs.This toy is great fun (for adults as well it would seem!).Would recommend."
6576,2106,5," My son is 3.5 with a huge imagination and the imaginext lions den castle is the perfect toy to let his imagination roam free!First impressions were mainly about how big it is it really is a substantial toy. It looks very sturdy and well made.Once you have opened the box you have enough in it to start instantly playing. My son loved discovering all the castle offers like defensive mode when the door shut and lights and sounds activate. Other things he enjoys are the trap door& making he castle turret collapse by pressing the left flag and revealing a secret exit to the prison with the right flag. You can scoop people in to the castle with the right pressure pad.A lion is supplied and you place this in the basement floor making sure that the notch at the base of the tail is in the notch in the top of the compartment In which he fits. You then turn the left pressure pad and the lion springs out! The figures supplied can also ride on the lion.The castle has lights and sounds which my son loves but there is loads you can do with the castle switched off which Mummy loves!The catapult shoots the discs a long way and at a good speed& not sure how long we will have all 6 for!My son says there are no negatives to this toy as its really cool! But from a Mummy perspective here are a couple of things I have noticedThe main plus point of its size is also a negative as I have no idea where we are going to keep it it's massive and doesn't reduce in size in anyway so if you are short on toy storage this may not be for youThere is no volume switch and it is quite loud. Also some of the sounds sound like the batteries are running out as kind of a slow drone. Not too bad but do grate after a while.Read more â€º"
6577,2106,4," The wee man loves this. particularly the firing of small plastic discs. Inevitably the pieces get scattered in the first few days& but i think that after 3 months we still have most of them.Its a sturdy toy with good sounds and actions. All work. Not sure what the lion is all about& but little boys (mine's 3) love lions so why not.I think this would come to life with more accessories as at 3 he lacks the imagination to make up elaborate role plays with only a couple of accessories but he's certainly interested in trying.Bought it with the bettering ram.Not 5 star as it only came with a couple of figures and accessories therefore not a wallet busting bargain but not a waste of money either&Like Imaginext  - so will be purchasing more in the set in due course&"
6578,2106,4," my five year old son loves this. santa brought extra knights for it too so he is well happy with it. quite sturdy design too."
6579,2106,5," It's a Christmas gift. So can't comment on the fun factor. But it's a lovely size and I know my boy will love it"
6580,2106,4," To the very sad person who keeps giving this and my other reviews negative votes& please get out and get a life!I have seen and tested a number of toys for the Vine programme over the years which have not been very well made and certainly not as interactive as this item. Firstly it is well made and not flimsy& so less likely to get broken. It comes with an array of |extra's| such as lions& guards& crown& crossbow& discs& thrown& helmets& axes and shields& which add to the play-ability of the toy. The Castle itself has a lot of hidden holes/nooks and crannies....plus music& so it is very interesting and when left with their imagination it is highly entertaining.Overall this is a very entertaining& well made toy and I am very happy to Highly Recommend it."
6581,2107,5," A Gift for my son. He wanted this from a Large Toy store competitor for Â£20 which I was not prepared to pay. This is the identical product for the fraction of the price. I Ordered more figures due to the quality of this one."
6582,2107,5," He loves anything myth and legend so this is ideal for him. Had lots of fun with it and am sure he will for years to come."
6583,2107,5," Good fierce looking fellow he has great design like his horns perfect for a toy castleðŸ°ðŸ°ðŸ°ðŸ° I would say greatðŸ²"
6584,2107,5," thanks very much my son loved his toy:)"
6585,2107,4," my grandson loved it"
6586,2108,2," I'm giving this only two stars because it's my second replacement and both times the hand broke off. But it does look good& shame about the hand. Would not have expected this from Papo."
6587,2108,5," Papo a quality product and fuels great imagination my little boy loves it .Shame his horse can't stand up !!!"
6588,2108,5," This is a very cool toy!"
6589,2108,5," Excellent. 10/10."
6590,2108,5," great"
6591,2109,5," Is a great and well detailed toy who goes with the blue crystal one the crystal one is a bit better because when you hold it up to the licht it is amazing but this one is good all the sameðŸ‰ðŸ‰"
6592,2109,5," thanks very much my son loved his toy:)"
6593,2109,5," Lovely dragon& great quality and size"
6594,2110,5," My six year old son loves these dragons (both sets). They are each individual and have their own names. They are not the biggest& but same size as his LEGO men so integrates well with them. We got him the skeleton army previously. He spends hours with them. They have so far managed to go with him to play& to bath and to bed without any trouble.The only downside is for those barefoot parents out there like myself - they hurt like blazes when stepped on in the middle of the night (but on the plus side have not broken yet as a result)."
6595,2110,5," does exactly as the description given& quick delivery"
6596,2110,5," Brought for school. The children love them."
6597,2110,5," Good"
6598,2111,5," I spent a long time looking for a castle for my little prince. I was originally looking for a wooden one& however I came across this one and fell in love.It is fantastic. The pieces are big& and very well made. It can be arranged in lots of different ways. It is also very durable - we have had it over 2 years and it still looks like new (and my boys aren't gentle)There is a fantastic range of knights and horses to go with it too. I can recommend the dragon - he is ace!"
6599,2111,5," super high quality castle&very sturdy&very well packed&and fast pp from amazon&a big thanks to amazon perfect as always.schleich toys fab kids want more now."
6600,2111,5," Fantastic castle& with a real sense of authenticity about it rather than plastic junk like some. Would recommend very highly"
6601,2111,5," My grandson loved this well constructed toy&the maker has a excellent range of quality figures."
6602,2111,5," I would recommend this unit to anyone who is putting together a castle set and loves to have good quality& long lasting toys.  The accessories are terrific and also very high quality and sturdy for long lasting service.  I have purchased these items for my grandsons and they get great joy playing with them."
6603,2112,5," These three really well detailed figures have stood up to a lot of rough use by my three year old& the weapons are regularly yanked out of position and swapped between the knights with no harm done. The arms and legs are moveable and the hands swivel& the uniforms are stuck down and cannot be swapped. I will definately be buying more of these figures in the future."
6604,2112,5," I love these. We bought them to go in my sons wooden castle. Great detailed outfits and accessories& well made and seem very durable. Cant fault them."
6605,2112,5," Super cute figures - my 3 year old was so pleased with them! Good value for money too. Bought the horse too"
6606,2112,5," Well made and promptly delivered"
6607,2113,5," great"
6608,2114,4," My six year old grandson has had hours of surprisingly imaginative play with this and the Playmobil Viking set. They were expensive& butworth the money."
6609,2115,5," En perfecto estado& muy rÃ¡pido el envÃ­o& mejor que en la foto. Recomiendo este comprador. Recomiendo este producto a todos."
6610,2115,5," Excellent item excellent price"
6611,2116,5," These toys never fail. Excellent quality. Dlivered very very quickly and will be played with for hours. A great buy& as always."
6612,2116,5," I buy a lot of papas for my toy castle so come on adults they are great&amazing this one is perfect for the Pegasus knightðŸ°ðŸ°"
6613,2116,5," great"
6614,2117,5," Great toy"
6615,2118,5," Love it - well made& strong& imaginative design - my 5 year old and 10 year old's love it. This is the second one we bought& seemed better to get a  pair (for their games)"
6616,2118,5," Value for money& gift for a small child."
6617,2119,5," Speedy delivery and well packaged. All limbs are bendable and the costumes are really cute. The cost was lower than some I have seen that were not as nice."
6618,2119,5," These are a great set of people for a 3 yr old. Good quality and apparently great fun to chase round a castle with a passing dragon"
6619,2119,5," Got them for my twins as Xmas prezzies to go with their wooden castle. Great product can't wait for them to see them Xmas morn"
6620,2119,5," These were excellent& beautifully made and my daughter loves them. Would absolutely recommend them."
6621,2119,5," Brilliant wooden characters & colourful and fun for tots and granddad too"
6622,2120,5," When I ordered this I was pretty excited& but now that I have received it I am SUPER HAPPY! This is an excellent fit for little boy hands& the roaring sound is great and not too loud (yay!) and he has an opening and closing mouth which can be controled with a trigger mechanism. Its brilliant. Although pretty painful when you get bopped on the head with it.  All in all and excellent purchase and I will be getting the dinosaur next for my other son."
6623,2120,5," |Raaaaaaaaargh| Says my boys dragon.He loves it. I also love it.All his freinds are well Jel that he has this and love to play with the castle that this toy interacts with.It has not taught my son how to write his name or count or do anything other than say |Raaaargh& give me your treasure|If you are looking for a dragon look no further.Gav (age 32)and Milo (age 2 and a half.)"
6624,2120,5," I've bought this for my 5 year old nephew as a Christmas present to go with the Imaginext castle I got him for his birthday. You will ned 2 x AA batteries (not supplied) to power it up.Every castle has it's dragon and the Imaginext castle is no different!This is a powerful looking dragon if I ever saw one and it's got to be said that a red dragon just looks stronger and more fierce than any other!Standing a lofty 10 inches and around a foot long this is a solidly built winged dragon. Made from tough plastic and definitely able to take a few knocks this is one dragon that may live for a thousand years! It's big and bulky and great for little hands to grab hold of and fly around the place.With big teeth& horns and powerful claws the imaginext castle is gonna take a battering! There are two levers that can be pressed- One is on the back (on the spine) and flaps the wings- One is underneath the body and when pressed (easily) the dragon 'roars' and spits fire (a red light inside the mouth lights up) and the head and neck dips down as the mouth opens and closes to pick up any stray castle dwellers! Arrrggghhh!!!!!You also get a dragon keeper in the box to keep your dragon under control with a golden suit of armour that can be removed when it gets too hot. You know - with all that fire breath!A top quality toy with a long lifespan& looks great and is a welcome addition to the Imaginext castle series of toys.Highly recommended"
6625,2120,5," I have 2 boys (15 months and 3 years)& and a husband.... We bought the castle as the main Christmas present for the three year old& and when this went on special a couple days before the holiday I couldn't resist getting it.  I'm so glad we did. Besides being really cool and making fab noises and interacting with the castle& it's great quality AND you really need a |bad guy| or opposing team or some sort of accessory to make pretend stories work really well with the imaginext sets.  We also have bat cave and  jokers hideaway and the fire station and one of the cars sets.... They are all great build quality. This dragon is awesome.  Seems a steep price for a dragon& but he's worth it."
6626,2120,5," I bought this and the castle for my son bday I was thinking why is it so dear till we opened it and its amazing they interact with all the different bits it fab"
6627,2120,5," I bought this for my grandson to go with the battering ram and the castle friends catapult.He is very happy with them all.I like the fact that they are well made and should last a long time."
6628,2120,5," I am usually a fan of wooden toys although I had vaguely seen the imaginext series when searching for a castle for my (soon to be) 3 yr old& it didn't interest me at all. How wrong I was!A relative bought this as an early birthday present for my son and he absolutely loves it! I must say I agree with him - it is very good quality& big enough to be impressive but small enough to be played with. There are quite a few movements/noises the dragon makes and I like that you can put armour on the knight. Looking forward to seeing how the castle interacts with it!"
6629,2120,5," We have an Imaginext Castle and it was sort of inevitable that we added a dragon at some point. He's absolutely great and while not a huge size he's still quite impressive at 34.3 x 27.4 x 12.4 cm. Through a variety of infra red signals& from dragon to castle& and manual buttons the dragon ROARS& moves his head& opens his mouth and flaps his wings. Requires 2 x AAA batteries& included& and he fits in perfectly with the other figures from the Imaginext castle range. More than happy to recommend."
6630,2121,5," Great item& however delivery is slow from those countries& so to take into account if this us a present"
6631,2122,5," Love all things Roman fits in well in my collection. Would love to be able to find similar items in a larger size."
6632,2122,5," Very pleased with my purchase."
6633,2122,2," The complete order still hasn't arrived& and one figure was incomplete. I am still waiting for the rest of the order to arrive."
6634,2123,5," Bought for our son who loves it"
6635,2124,5," Loved by my grandson. Very quick delivery thank you."
6636,2125,5," Papo knights and horses are brilliant!  We bought this last Christmas for my son to go with a wooden castle we got. We also bought a papo castle mat which was brilliant too!  Excellent product!"
6637,2125,4," Really lovely Knight but didn't overly last a long time. My son possibly a bit too young to have something as delicate as this. Purchased for his 5th birthday. Quite small for the price too but think before you buy as are delicate."
6638,2125,5," This Papo Dragon King is extremely realistic and looks fantastic& a really nice addition to my medieval PAPO collection. I got it for my Papo horse so I could use it in a model jousting match."
6639,2125,3," great item but unfortunatly lance broke withing a hour and wont fix& son still loves it and he lives happy in the castle with all his friends"
6640,2126,5," What can I say&my son loves his cars vehicles and they get played with a lot so stand up to a lot from a 7 yr old boy.They also get took into the bath and have stood up to this too.Great price&cheaper than stores when I purchased."
6641,2126,5," We got this vehicle to go with my three year old grandson's Disney Cars 2 collection. He plays with it all the time& well constructed and good value."
6642,2126,5," My 3 year old son loves collecting all these cars so that he can build a cars world. This is another good one for his collection."
6643,2126,4," great addition to my sons ever growing collection. well made and a good pricewould definatly purchase more from this site"
6644,2126,5," Great value great service another added to the ever growing collection of Disney cars cars my 4 year old loves."
6645,2126,5," My son really loves this. He is a real fan of Cars and Cars 2 and it has his seal of approval."
6646,2126,4," My Grandson loved this although I thought it rather expensive for such a small car."
6647,2126,5," Very pleased - delivered quickly and exactly as described."
6648,2127,4," This is a simple& even classic toy made by reputable firm Golden Bear which is suitable for ages 3 up.  It is fun for adults and children of all ages and should last for many years unless badly abused!"
6649,2128,5," My nearly 2 year old loves this toy.  He plays with it in the sand pit and has a great time.  Well made and realistic but not cheap to buy."
6650,2129,4," This is another lovely Bruder model& excellent detail& but not as durable as previous bruder purchases. The drawbar broke within a couple of weeks and we've really struggled to mend or replace it& so it hasn't been played with as much as the other bruder machines. Also the tiny little potatoes which come with it are capable of getting just about everywhere in the house! Although it's a lovely toy& very detailed and true to life& it has proven to be my least favourite Bruder Farm machine so far."
6651,2129,4," Great quality even my little feller can't break even tho there are plenty of moving partsAnother member to his ever expanding bruder collection"
6652,2129,5," The item is great and has afforded my grandson hours of pleasure.  Very pleased and will recommened it to anyone."
6653,2129,5," my son loved it& this is a delicate product suited to older boys my son was only two"
6654,2130,5," This is a great toy& both of my kids take it in the sand pit& drive it off the side& spray it down to clean it and then slam it into other things to move them out of the way! Great toy that's providing lots of fun and entertainment..."
6655,2130,4," From reports very happy with it& as we live 5000 miles away we only see presents sent once a year when we are vacation"
6656,2130,5," great loader& as expected quality from bruder& nephew loves it"
6657,2130,5," lovely truck i know our little grandson will love it"
6658,2131,3," I was expecting that different characters should be available but not all characters were present. Two of them were the same (pororo). The toys were smaller than I expected. It's not worth the price. A bit expensive. However& my son still enjoyed this item. He loves it:)"
6659,2131,5," Item as described xmas present so not opened yet"
6660,2132,5," Excellent toys. Perfect for bathtime. Bowl of icy cold water and one of warm and they work brilliantly. The colour change is instant and bright. Very pleased"
6661,2132,5," Great car my son loved it and played with it the most at Christmas!....great buy!"
6662,2132,5," Excellent colour changer car."
6663,2132,5," Grandson loved it."
6664,2133,5," Great value and delivery very quick."
6665,2134,5," Arrived very quickly& well packed& as described& very happy. 5*."
6666,2135,5," These figures are a little bit rubbery& good poses& no problems with additional flash& another excellent set from Revell"
6667,2136,5," Arrived promptly well packaged. Exactly as shown in picture and good quality."
6668,2136,5," Great with the garage."
6669,2137,4," this was bought for my grandson and I was impressed with the quality build of the product and he loved playing with it& along with his other toys. Speedy delivery and I would recommend this seller."
6670,2137,4," This is a very sturdy ambulance which my 2.5 yr old son likes to play with. I was a bit disappointed that none of the doors open as I think he would play with it even more if they did."
6671,2137,5," Bought as a 'joke' gift for my daughter as she wants to be a paramedic when she leaves school..."
6672,2137,5," Nice metal ambulance with all the detail& should last forever even with rough play."
6673,2137,5," Great present for my great grandson.  Many thanks."
6674,2137,5," great ambulance my 3yr old grandson loves it."
6675,2138,5," Strong& virtually unbreakable& fit comfortably into a little boy's hand& andlessly played with.  I highly recommend SIKU toys for quality and they are reasonably priced.  My 6 year old son specifically asked for this pack& and was perfectly happy with them."
6676,2138,5," Excellent"
6677,2139,4," small car but nice tio add to the collection. Packagain good and easy to see and open. For a good behaviour prize or santas stocking!"
6678,2140,5," my son loves this little model as part of his collection."
6679,2141,5," I have been waiting many years (since I first saw the films!!)for an accurate model of the Back To The Future DeLorean to become available in the U.K. and this offering from Sunstar does not disappoint. I had already bought the part 3 version in a high street retailer but couldn't find the first two anywhere until I looked on Amazon. The model is very detailed right down to even the time and date readout inside the car! It has a lovely brushed metal finish and is a good size (1:18)unlike other versions that have also appeared (1:24's 1:48'setc)On this model there is a button underneath which will make the car 'fly' (push wheels up) Comes in an attractive box (I havent taken mine out!) The only concern I had when ordering was how it would be packaged but Amazon did a great job it arrived in perfect condition. Very impressed!"
6680,2141,5," When I first seen this I wasnt sure why it was quite pricey but when I recieved it I wasnt surprised. The quality of this is absolutely superb. The gull doors open up the way exactly like the DeLorean& the bonnet opens and the wheels turn in the flying position. It actually seems like the actual time machine from the movie but shrunk to a model scale the detail is that good.It has a nice weight to it and solid feel& the box is also very presentable. I keep it stored away though but wouldn't dream of throwing it out. The DeLorean sits comfortable by my old Amiga games on a high shelve.When I got mine though a small part from inside the door had come off& but a spot of strong glue and it's been perfect.I would recommend this to anyone who loves the BTTF movies& it's worth the price for this great quality and really puts all the other cheaper models of the time machine to shame."
6681,2141,4," This is a perfect looking model with all the details you expect. The only downside is that the wheel mechanism is a bit flawed. If you want to set the wheels in driving position they don't lock perfectly into place. Whenever I set it to driving position and put it on the display case the wheels always tent to tilt a little and not stay in place. I would suggest you go for the Back To The Future Part 1 Time Machine 1:18th instead."
6682,2141,5," I bought this for a mate's birthday who is a BTTF nut (as i am!) and i almost didn't want to hand it over.  The quality of the product is very high and i can realistically see myself purchasing all  3 models over time. (pardon the pun) The product was very well packaged and arrived swiftly.  I would definitely purchase again.  5/5SJW 2009"
6683,2141,5," this is a excellant detailed model of the delorean in fly mode& i was amazed how detailed it was and its a decent size &i would recommened to everybody who likes back to the future trilogy."
6684,2142,5," i needed the motor to put on a wreath for a family member the right size colour just what i required& fast delivery well done all round thank-you"
6685,2142,4," quite durable compact toy would buy again. Nice clean lines and my son loved it. Would definitely recommend it to children"
6686,2142,5," The young lad I bought this for was |Over the Moon| with it as it is very like the Motorhome his father owns."
6687,2142,5," Excellent - bought as a present for my son who is travelling around Europe in a motor home just like this"
6688,2142,5," this was a xmas present for my other half and he loved it - we are going to put it in our motorhome."
6689,2142,5," Bought as a gift. Perfect for what we wanted. Well made and really great value."
6690,2142,5," i bought this for my grandson as his parents havea similar van. I was delighted with the quality and it is a really good size. I would certainly buy again from this range and supplier. It arrived in record time and was really well pachaged so no dents or scrapes. really pleased with it"
6691,2142,4," This came up to expectations.  Bought as a |fun| gift for my elder brother who thought it was great and is adding to his collection of toy cars. A very good model."
6692,2143,5," MY SON IS A HUGE FAN OF THE PIXAR CHARACTER CARS I FOUND THIS SITE THE BEST FOR CHOICE& VALUE &AND AVAILABILITY. THEY OFFER MORE THAN IS AVAILABLE IN THE SHOPS AS THEY HAVE ALOT MORE CHARACTERS ON OFFER AND BELIEVE ME& I HAVE SEARCHED FOR THEM."
6693,2143,3," By misreading the size as being the toy not the packaging I expected a bigger model than the one I had already bought at half the price."
6694,2143,5," i brought this for my son who is mad about the film cars&he loves it& i think its a great deal& arrived well packaged and really quick"
6695,2144,3," This arrived very quickly and well packaged.So no complaints there .I had read the other reviews and I agree that the best use for this would definitely be for cake decoration.However it was one of the gifts for my granddaughters birthday and she absolutely loved it and she plays with it all the time along with her other smurf people and the windmill house.One problem &once it has been built up it is very easily taken apart !!! We have had to put it back together many times and there is no way to stick the parts together.I really wouldn't recommend it as a toy but certainly useful as a cake topper"
6696,2144,3," I was disappointed when I received this.  I expected it to be a large car but its really small and has to be put together so not very strong. Smurfett does come out though so thats a bonus!"
6697,2144,3," My son loves the Smurfs and so I got him this toy to match a boy smurf in a car we had already purchased.  It only took minutes to build and he has had loads of fun playing with them both& definitely a great buy and very reasonably priced too."
6698,2144,5," I bought this to put on top of my 5 year old daughters birthday cake as she loves everything to do with smurfette. She loves playing with this so it's been great value as it doubled up as a cake decoration and a toy."
6699,2144,5," smaller than what i thought but my daughter loves it so thats all that matters purchased to go along with her smurfette house& would recommend this product"
6700,2145,5," Bought this for my grandson who is obsessed with cleaning/rubbish/hoovering (that won't last!). It's an excellent copy of a real-life waste truck and he spends hours lifting the back up and 'emptying' the bins. The truck is a really good size (big) and we will be buying more from this manufacturer as the quality is excellent."
6701,2145,5," Bought this as a Christmas present for my 6 yr old grandson.  It is one more for his collection.  They are extremely durable and he loves them.  Highly recommend them."
6702,2145,2," This product is not what we expected for the price we paid for it. Both bin handles were missing so the bins cannot be loaded onto the truck& they were clearly broken off as you could see where they had come off. My little boy was so excited as this was what he wanted for Xmas& I could not take it off him to send back& and then to top it all I saw them in the toy shop for 19.99 after I had just paid 46.00 for it& not worth the money"
6703,2145,4," Very strong looks good feel my grandson will enjoy this toy.  It looks strong and I think it looks as if it will take a good many locks."
6704,2145,5," I bought the Garbage Truck for my grandson for his birthday and he loves it. We have bought Tonka toys in the past because they stand up well to a 4 year old but this time we thought we would give Bruder a try and we weren't dissapointed.Overall a good buy."
6705,2145,3," Bruder - Rear Loading Garbage TruckBought well in advance("
6706,2145,5," My 2 year old grandson loves this toy. It's quite big and robust. Glad i bought it. Amazon have come up trumps again."
6707,2145,5," One bin broke after a few days. I got a replacement item within 24hours...excellent"
6708,2146,5," love weise models!!!!!!!"
6709,2147,5," I have bought 4 of these bulldozers now basically because I like them. Three for different grandchildren& boys& and one for here for visits. I have also bought a tracked digger& which still lives here& and a tracked loader which went off as a present to a nephew of one of my sons. All have survived and are played with often. All the boys are& or were& about 3 years old when they received the toys. I think they are very good value for money."
6710,2147,5," Bruder make some well detailed& authentic looking models& and this is one of them.  The colours and mouldings are very well executed.  little rubber feet to put onto the tracks come with the model incase you want to use it on laminate floors indoors.  You get more for your money with Bruder and this model will complement any construction yard."
6711,2147,3," My son (age- nearly 3) was given this for Christmas. Unfortunately& part of the plastic attachment point for the front blade broke almost immediately on Christmas day itself. This was patched with a cable tie& which lasted solidly until early May (4 months). During that time& he played with it fairly frequently& but not exhaustively and always inside the house because the weather has been so miserable! At the start of May& the rest of the attachment point for the blade broke. This has now been patched up with 4 cable ties to hold it together& which will hopefully last a while longer. So& while I genuinely think Bruder toys are great& and we have a number (Mack granite flatbed with JCB backhoe& MAN dump truck& Front loader& and a Schaeff mini excavator)& we're not having great success with this one. That being said& my son doesn't really seem to mind when things don't work quite as they are meant to& and the lack of a blade at the front of a bulldozer may well be a non-issue....."
6712,2147,4," This seems like a lovely strong toy. It seems well built and a good size for kids& not too small. The only bad points may be that the plough on th back needs an adults help to be changed and also the grips for the tracks that are supplied only covered about 30 or 40% or the tracks. Again& worth the money and I am happy I made the purchase."
6713,2147,5," As with the rest of our Bruder 1:16 items& excellent quality and loads of play value for our nearly 5 year old. Good indoors& in sand and in real soil. Only thing that could be improved is they need to advertise that you can change and buy extra attachments for these vehicles! I only just realised this after 2 years of buying them."
6714,2147,3," This was bought as a Christmas Present for my grandson"
6715,2147,5," Excellent toy well made and great detail. I did make the mistake of buying this for a 15 month old so couldn't give it to him as it's recommended for +3. So please be aware. Anyway we donated this to the salvation army Xmas appeal so hopefully someone will be loving it"
6716,2147,5," Fantastic tractor good quality& sturdy& good size& will definitely buy more construction toys by this company& very good quality - little grandson loved it."
6717,2148,5," Really pleased with my order'"
6718,2149,5," Which to have the full collection for my child.Received as expected.I do recommend to get this collection to your child."
6719,2149,4," My little boy loves disney cars and was very happy to get this for his birthday& was a bargain price aswell."
6720,2149,5," My son loves his new vehicle especially as it's from Disney Cars 2 which is one of his favourite movies."
6721,2149,5," grandson loves this item"
6722,2150,5," I saw this on sale elsewhere and deliberated& after reading the bad reviews if I should spend more on a much more expensive but generally well made alternative. I figured I would gamble on this one and its a gamble thats paid off. It was easy and quick to build& its fully functional (the crane rotates& the claw goes up and down and back and forth). My sons octonauts figurines and playmobil figurines are the right size for it& and its pretty awesome for a kids toy. I'm happy with the construction and expect to get at least a couple of years use out of it. Son is& of course& delighted with it. Probably best suited to children who are old enough to take care of things (not run around knocking everything over types)."
6723,2150,5," I cant even begin to tell you how much I love this toy! Similar products are soooo expensive compared to this one. I bought it for my son's 4th birthday last week. The crane claw goes up and down& back and forth and the arm rotates. There is also an alternative little platform that can be used instead of the claw. It looks striking and is taller than my son which makes it a really bold& lovely toy! If you have a child who is into knocking things over& it wont be suitable as it will fall over with a good push. This doesn't mean it falls over easily as we all know little kids are strong and like things to crash! My sons autistic and hyper all the time and he manages not to push it over so most 3-4 year olds plus will be fine. Theres space for a little figure to sit in the drivers seat (I didn't get a figure with it as the picture suggests) and theres also a little counter balance box the other end of the arm and a platform. Its just a lovely lovely toy and my son adores it. If you have like JCB digger toys or a duplo farm set or similar you can do some lovely play. Im rather delighted with it and Ive already convinced a mum friend to get it for her son's 4th in a few months! :)"
6724,2150,2," Bought as a Xmas present for my 6 year old son. Looks good when built up but a Total Disaster. Crane only goes up& will not go down or rotate. My son was really disappointed as this was on his Santa's list!"
6725,2150,5," Sturdy toy& well made& easy to assemble and works perfectly. Also like to comment on how quickly it was despatched and delivered& especially so as I live in the North of Scotland."
6726,2150,5," Very well made& sturdy construction. Be warned its all plastic and the motor is what it is - but for a 3-4 year old it's fantastic!!"
6727,2150,5," WOW! Amazing toy! I've bought this for my 5 years old son for Christmas and he loves it. In fact I love it too. I was playing with it myself too. It is big enough strong enough and very stable enough! Quality toy"
6728,2150,4," This was a massive hit with my almost 3 year old son last Christmas. Everyone who came to our house ended up playing with it. It's not very strong though. It's lasted until this month when the arm broke in half."
6729,2150,5," Bought for my 4 year for xmas ...goes together easily &looks fantastic"
6730,2151,5," the best tractor models"
6731,2152,5," The F15 is one of my favourite aircraft"
6732,2153,5," My son loved these two&  great quality. Beyond the normal quality Mattel are currently pushing out (flat bottomed cars&  those in the known will understand)"
6733,2154,5," great"
6734,2155,5," Excellent All round Service and another Great Model to add to my Collection Very Pleased and satistifed with purchase&Many thanks"
6735,2155,5," great sturdy car. 4 yr old grandson thrilled with this addition to his collection"
6736,2156,5," WAS a little disappoined that figures cannot be taken out of vehicle& however this is ment to be a collectors item but my 8 years old wants it to play with."
6737,2157,5," A Revell re-issue of a kit first produced by Matchbox & in doing so it carries over the slight tendency to heavy-handedness of detail which marked the kit when new . Still it is not too bad for all that and will & with careful assembly and restrained application of weathering in the final finish & make up into a quite stunning model . Cries out to be displayed in a diorama incorporating either one of Revell's impressive 1/72 scale U-boats or their superb E-boat ."
6738,2157,5," This is a good build - fairly easy for virtually any level of modeller- the parts go well together - and easily& there are no excess bits of sprue. The only difficult part I found was attaching the floats - however& a little |trial and error| and patience did that job. The markings are good - the fact that there is no swastika included in the markings is a bit of a pain - you'll have to get a set of those from somewhere else as I did some time ago - there are firms where a sheet of probably 30 different sized ones can be obtained (the swastika was on decal sheets for Luftwaffe models in the 1960s - Airfix was one firm that did |add| two swastikas to the sheet) This aircraft I have wanted to add to my collection for many years - and now that has been done. The aircraft does look good once assembled and would fit well into a large diorama alongside say a BV 222 Wiking a Dornier 24 seaplane and say a Junkers JU 52 -3M floatplane and an Arado 196 - that would make for one busy seaplane base - with all the accompanying land items such as some 88mm guns for anti - aircraft defence !"
6739,2158,5," good"
6740,2159,5," Great quality really good set"
6741,2160,5," Brilliant"
6742,2160,5," great"
6743,2160,5," Great"
6744,2161,5," Was more than thrilled when the lorry was delivered it surpassed my expectations  on every front from build quality&authenticity to even the packaging.I cannot reccomend this product highly enough."
6745,2161,5," Delivered well within the specified date. was exactly as discribed& in it's own display case and the quality of the model just shows through& fabulous value for money"
6746,2161,3," Eddie Stobart Teletubby truck........Good replica of the vehicle& die cast lorry& good quality as always with Stobart goods.  shame it wasn't a little bigger."
6747,2161,5," love this lorry after seeing it at truckfest earlier on in year looks great with all my other stobart collection will defo recomend to others thank you"
6748,2161,5," it was delivered on time& came in good case ready for displaying& my grandson is very pleased with it and cant wait for me to get him another"
6749,2161,5," Another bought for Christmas and is very smart. Good display size and well made and packaged. Recipient very pleased with it. Thank you."
6750,2162,5," Fantastic toy& comes in great packaging that you really dont want to tear open to get to the toy. Unfortunately I bought this for my 3 year old and the asthetics of the packaging went unnoticed - but he loved the Batmobile and plays with it for hours! Great for your wannabe Batman child!"
6751,2162,5," Although not the rarest of the Corgi DC Comics batmobiles issued between 2004 and 2008 they are becoming rare now collect it now or see this go up in price. For the full range see Gotham City 43rd Street Motor Museum available only from http:"
6752,2162,5," This is a very neat&well made model&its heavy and solid and looks far better in reality than any photo makes it appear.it sits well with the other 1/43 scale models and the very deep blue colour is most appealing."
6753,2163,5," My 5 year old adored this until the next treat came along but knowing him it will get it's place in the sun again at some point.It doesn't do anything amazing but I think it is good honest value.As my son is really careful with his toys it's sturdiness has not been tested but it is still intact."
6754,2163,4," This is a toy to keep at my house for when my grandson visits. All doors on the car open - I wanted the caravan to open too but my grandson is quite happy with only the car doors opening. He loves opening the hatchback and putting 'rubbish' in to take to the tip. I only scored three for durability because although the body of the vehicles is durable the little blip that attaches the caravan broke off but we have managed to improvise.reviewed by Sherrie Lowe& author of Song Of The Phoenix"
6755,2163,4," Nice quality buy keeps young and old quiet for quite awhile! Takes older ones back to the happy days of caravaning you cannot beat these type of good play value toys"
6756,2163,3," You get what you pay for really. It's a bit flimsy but my son likes it. The car doors open but nothing on the caravan opens."
6757,2163,2," The car of this set was alright but the caravan was terrible. The wheels came off after a few days of play from my son who is under 2. I glued and glued but it was apparent that the base just didn't want to stay on. The car itself is die-cast so pretty robust& it's just the plastic bits like the connecting hooks and the caravan (the entire caravan is plastic) that have snapped. I didn't expect much from this set but I was still pretty disappointed."
6758,2163,2," On Christmas morning it broke!  The tow bar is incredibly weak and broke without any rough play.  Am more annoyed that the seller did not even have the courtesy to respond to my comments. Overall& I would not recommend this product to anyone. If you are still tempted& be aware that only the car doors open& not on the caravan.  Expect disappointed children."
6759,2163,4," This was a good value product which I am sure will give endless fun. Looks hard wearing too."
6760,2163,3," Grandson loved the idea of having a car and caravan same as grandad's and was happy with the opening doors on the car.Unfortunately& the opening boot broke off after a few weeks and cannot be mended. This was the only fault we found with it.Otherwise not bad value for money."
6761,2164,5," When I first saw that a Die-cast model of XL5 was going to be released&for a while I was back in 1962.It was an Immediate |must buy|& but at Â£39.99 it wasn't going to be a cheap piece of memorabilia.The model itself has a comfortably heavy weight to it.|Fireball junior|(The Nosecone) detaches and reattaches from the main body with a strong in-built magnet.The level of detail is excellent&even the cabin crew of Steve Zodiac and Robert the Robot.I have a slight criticism (not with the model)with the Stand that comes with it& it is a bit fiddly to seat the model on.(After playing with it)But Overall& a great piece of Nostalgia. And worth every penny.Go on& fly around the Living room in Fireball XL5!"
6762,2164,5," XL5 is my favorite display model. It looks stunning. The design of this ship is classic 50's. And with the red and yellow on the wings and tail contrasting against the weathered hull& it just glows in my office.Product Enterprise has done a fantastic job of bringing the XL5 to life. The pod on the nose comes off like the original and is attached via a strong magnet& and this works beautifully.It also comes with a stand& so it looks like it's in flight.A truly beautiful model worthy of any sci-fi collection. The RRP is 39.99 and it's well worth the money."
6763,2164,5," Like Supercar&Fireball XL5 was one of the first TV programes I remember.I always wanted as a small child a model Of Supercar and Fireball&and after a very long wait my wish has come true.Product Enterprise LTD have produced one of the finest models Ive ever seen&the quality is fantastic and and the reproduction to the original is astounding.Each Model comes with a display stand and you will be very surprised by the weight of Fireball.They dont come cheap but the quality Is well worth the price I dont consider the models |Toys| but rather symbols of childhood from my genaration.Along with Supercar (both the colour version and Black and version)and Stingray they look very impressive in a display cupboard.I only hope Product Enterprise plan to produce the Thunderbirds&then my life will be complete...."
6764,2165,5," My son loves all diggers& dumpers etc and he really liked this one.  Quality of the Bruder toys are outstanding& the toys are more expensive than other makes but you get what you pay for.  My sons are very rough with their toys and these get left outside all year round.  We have an extensive collection of bruder toys and not had a problem yet!  Would definetly reccommend."
6765,2165,5," My son loves this compactor.  He uses it to roll out mud& sand and anything he can lay his hands on!  Great buy!"
6766,2165,5," Bruder toys are very well built& robust and fun. WE got this for our 3 yr old& along with the fantastic crane& and all our older boys (and mum and dad too......) love playing with with them too. Very high quality product& extremely well made and tough too."
6767,2165,5," My son loves this road roller and can spend hours pretending he is making roads for his farmers and animals to walk on& good quality addition to the Bruder range."
6768,2165,5," Very nice toy.  Our little boy plays with it regularly with his digger.  Very well made& robust and detailed very nicely.  Very good German engineering!"
6769,2165,2," We were expecting great things& given the other reviews& but we didn't like this at all. Lightweight& plasticky& and rather small."
6770,2165,5," Great value for money& got lots of Bruder toys& never had any trouble with them& grandson loves them& and are all very strong."
6771,2165,4," excellent delivery time looks good quality for price paid but as its for  xmas present cant say much more at this time"
6772,2166,5," Son loves these die cast cars and loved the twins. Good quality product. Now I will be getting the other cars for him."
6773,2167,3," We are obsessed with collecting all the characters off the movie.Ok& so maybe I get a little overexcited when i see the ones we don't have....I love these cars and I got them as a surprise for good behaviour.My 4yr old says they are a bit too small to play with but he does like them."
6774,2167,3," I was looking forward to these arriving as my boy has quite a collection now. However please be aware that these are very small!  Smaller than the other standard car sizes. With that I have only given 3 stars."
6775,2167,5," Bought this for my nephew who has a large Disney Pixar Cars collection. He was desperate to get Mama Topolino and was not disappointed.  Good quality and plenty of fun. Be aware though& the cars are small."
6776,2167,5," Cute pair together which help to complete my son's ongoing collection of Disney characters from the movies Disney Cars& Cars 2 and Mater's Tall Tales."
6777,2168,5," This has to be the best plastic modl kit in its price range! It's much bigger than the price would let you expect so it's not a bad model to get started out in model ship building but it's detailed enough to engage the most seasoned modeller"
6778,2168,5," This is a great model to make& the solid plastic yards with sails makes rigging easy."
6779,2169,5," A great present for my 10 year old."
6780,2170,5," This was one of the few Disney Cars that our grandson didn't have so he was thrilled to receive it."
6781,2171,5," This item was purchased for my son who is a massive James Bond fan. The product came on time just before Christmas. And I was extremely impressed on that. Thanks very much..."
6782,2171,5," purchased this as a present"
6783,2171,5," happy"
6784,2172,5," I bought this for my son when he was 3 well over a year ago& and he still plays with it regularly.  It is still intact& although a couple of the signs are on the flimsy side.  The plane is well made& and rolls well.  The catering van has come apart a few times& but is easily put back together again.  Altogether& a great toy& and has given my son hours of pleasure."
6785,2172,4," Bought this to entertain my little grandson in case we were delayed at the airport going on holiday. It certainly achieved it's purpose - good selection of little things to play with. Quite small& reasonable quality and kept him entertained for quite a while."
6786,2172,5," ...having got the single plane previously the new owner is like a dog with two tails...job done!If your child is obsessed with planes...airports...travel& this will keep them amused :-)"
6787,2172,5," Our 4 year old has got great interest in planes and airport so he plays with it constantly. Its  well made  and considering that our boy breaks things easily this one is still standing"
6788,2172,5," Bought for our two year old Grandson who is airport and plane mad. Played with it most of Christmas Day."
6789,2172,3," my nephew will love this& it was a bit disappointing it looked a lot bigger but is actually alot smaller"
6790,2173,5," Bought for my grandson who is cars mad what can I say good value and came on time"
6791,2174,5," Bought for my son (5yr) to coincide with the local harvest as he loves watching the harvesters through his window.  He already had the tractor and trailer and all are fantastic.  My husband has commented on the fact that these are the only toys which haven't been pulled to pieces or broken under heavy use due to their robust build.  I have just ordered another bruder toy for Christmas (digger) and would recommend these for any child with a love for industrial vehicles as although they are a bit pricey they do last."
6792,2174,5," My 4 year old loves all things farm machinery related so we'd bought him a combine harvester in lego before.  As with all lego it isn't great if you want to then play with it.......but this is robust& big (!!) and great fun.  Beware as the grain could turn into a nightmare but as my son would rather keep it in a bag& it's not a problem to me.  It has lots of functioning/opening parts and has kept his interest for a month or so now when other toys have already been discarded.  We have other Bruder products and I'm convinced that we should only buy Bruder from now on.  Sadly he loves it so much he screams if anyone touches/moves it and refuses to let any other kids play with it......could it be too good??!!"
6793,2174,5," I didn't know this brand of toys until my then 2.5 year old was offered a tractor and a cement mixer over 1 year ago. I was trully impressed - the toys are just like the real thing and seem to be very durable. We then got him a trailer for his birthday and Santa brought him this harvester last Christmas. It very nicely made as with all Bruder toys it seems. It comes with a bag of grain so can be used like a real harvester. As a parent I would say that the only downside is the size of these toys - they all are pretty big& but still very much worth getting."
6794,2174,5," My 8 year-old wanted this truck for Christmas this last year (2011) and I was only able to get it from overseas because Bruder cannot sell John Deere trucks in the US.  I ordered on December 5th and the truck arrived on December 29th...a little late for Christmas and 10 days past it's expected arrival date& but the shipping cost was so low that I couldn't really complain much.As for the toy itself& my son couldn't be happier.  Unlike the harvesters that are available in the US made by Bruder& this one actually functions.  It comes with little plastic pellets that you load into a hopper and you are able to crank them out into a dump truck...this feature was important to my son as he researched combine harvesters exhaustively on the internet and was very emphatic that he had something that 'worked'.  This is a great real-life toy.  It is large and provides hours of fun& indoors and out.  The only small complain that I have is that two of the small lights on top of the Harvester broke off right away.  They have no impact on the function of the vehicle and they are not really missed.  Just a warning."
6795,2174,5," These toys are so much better than anything ERTL sells. Built for children.  Because John Deere has a license agreement with the United States& John Deere Bruder toys cannot be sold.  I had to go to ebay and Amazon u.k. I purchased 2 combines - one from the U.K. and one from Portugal.  Even with the shipping charges these items were cheaper than buying a John Deere Ertl toy here.  These quality toys are made for children& functional& durable and just pretty darn fun to play with.  Thank you Bruder for building a toy worth the money!  I'll never waste my money on Ertl again."
6796,2174,5," I've just got this for my 4 year old son. He's been crazy about combines since seeing them in the fields by our house. This thing is a BEAST. it goes perfectly with the other Bruder tractors& trailers& forklifts and telehandlers. Bruder have proved to be almost indistructable and super hard wearing be it in doors or out. Delivery was crazy quick& ordered at 5pm on a bank holiday Sunday and it was on my doorstep 9am Tuesday. We'll worth the extra money for Bruder. Cannot recommend then enough."
6797,2174,5," Not tried as present for grandson but very pleased with price. Looks well made. Can't wait till 25th to see his face"
6798,2174,5," My 4 year old requested this for his birthday and he was not disappointed.  It has very good detail and he loves the grain ( it gos every where ).  Its also quite big but in my sons eyes not a bad thing.  Hes had it 5 months now and id say its very durable& hes played with it indoors and out and its survived his younger dropping it a few time too.  Defo a must to add to your big farm play."
6799,2175,5," cracking model........"
6800,2176,4," It arrived before schedule which was good& but a wheel came off in less than 2 hours of my brother playing with it. It is more of a collectors item I would say but my brother seems to be entertained enough by just racing it with the rest of his toys. Overall I am rating it 4 stars."
6801,2176,3," My grandson loves this but in my opinion when you compare to say the spy model& that one is better value."
6802,2176,5," A great car to add to my son's collection.  He was over the moon and plays with it all the time.  A great part of his Finn McMissile collection.  Fast prompt delivery.  Many thanks"
6803,2176,5," Another addition to the collection!  Grandson was thrilled.  A little disappointed that he couldn't play with it in the bath - after all& it is a submarine!"
6804,2176,3," Not as loved as the one without fins - but still played with."
6805,2177,5," arrived on time and well packaged.  grandson loves loading his tractor trailer and transporting them around his bedroom."
6806,2177,2," Very big. Just big plastic blocks. My son doesn't play with them."
6807,2177,5," Perfect for bruder toys and bailing and lifting"
6808,2177,5," Really happy nice quick delivery"
6809,2178,4," This was bought for me as a Christmas present after I said I'd loved Airfix kits as a child. Forty years down the road& this kit has confirmed that I still do - almost a visceral pleasure in opening the box - evocative artwork& moulded figures& two tanks and a forward command post - this truly is a brilliant package esp as it contains glue& paint and paintbrushes. The German infantry figures are exactly as I recalled from the 1960/70s although the British Paras looked somewhat poorer quality.  All in all& a great way to re-live some memories....."
6810,2178,4," Bought this set for my son aged 10 as he wanted some tanks to play with his soldiers.  Thought the battle scene would be a good idea as well.  Did not realise this set comes with two sets of soldiers in addition to the tanks diorama and paints so overall good value for money.  The plastic base is a bit light so will probably glue down on a wooden board. You would need to buy some additional grass/bush stuff to make it like the box but I think he will be happy enough with the set as it is."
6811,2178,4," As per the other reviewers this quite a good set that needs setting up and painting& you may need to attach the set to a firmer base to give the diorama better stability. Plus you may need to buy additional modelling tools and paints to recreate what you see on the back of the box.  My only gripe is the fact that all scale of the models is actually varied"
6812,2178,4," I purchased this kit as it worked out cheaper than buying other various kits for the same sort of set. Delivery was quick and well before estimated delivery date. First of all scale of the models are actually varied. The two tanks are the same but I am sure the British and German soldiers are of different scale. This is hidden in the picture on the back of the box by the fact that all the figures are british or german.  The quality of the models is good but they are too small and delicate to be used as toys or endure any rough handling. The size of the figure means painting them is a frustrating task and the tanks are fiddle to build at times. The set included paints& glue and brushes which are a nice extra but a good set of modelling tools and paints are essential to create results anywhere near what you see on the back of the box ( along with various other model shop items). The diorama base is very thin and for best results I recommend glueing it to a piece of wood.In a nutshell the set is a good money saver for those looking to build an entire scene but not for those wishing to purchase an easy sunday afternoon 10 minute build as it requires to much extra attention."
6813,2178,5," not built it yet but it looks great &my grandson will be made up with it &its for Christmas 2015&"
6814,2178,4," But Airfix how is this Skill Level 2.The wheels on the tanks are about 4mm in diameter and there are pieces even smaller.Other than that I have helped my son a couple of times as he gets carried away sometimes when making models."
6815,2178,5," Arrived promptly within specified time. Well packaged so no damage. Was exactly what nephew had asked for so was very popular on Christmas Day!!"
6816,2178,5," this is great for airfix begeners and as a gift i realy enjoyed making it. the only problem with it is that the base is a bit small and the paratroopers positons arent that great but otherwise its great"
6817,2179,5," Really great quality"
6818,2179,4," Grandson loved it"
6819,2180,5," smashing little model& well worth the monny"
6820,2181,5," the puppies privates"
6821,2182,5," This is a super toy for any tractor daft child.  It's chunky size makes sit easy to manouvere.  The hook on the front broke quite quickly but it had had quite a lot of use!  Has provided our wee boy with hours of fun already."
6822,2182,5," Good strong item. Grandson loves it. Has had loads of fun with it.  He is clearly going to have it for a long time. Still as good as new."
6823,2182,5," A great&toy beautifully made&strong&durable&just the toy for budding farmers&l might even let my grandson&play with it."
6824,2182,5," Great quality& bought it for my 2 year old& very robust toys."
6825,2182,5," Please see review on the tractor trailer bought at the same time.  I looked for a tractor suitable for a toddler who is mad keen on tractors and big machinery.  For its price&this one is big and sturdy& with lots of detail."
6826,2182,5," These toys are fantastic and great value for money.  This tractor made our grandson a very happy little boy on his birthday and I know he'll be looking forward to adding to his collection in the future.  Great buy"
6827,2182,5," i bought this tractor for my young son for his birthday&who loves playing with farm toys&it is very durable&and seems to stand a lot of rough play..."
6828,2182,5," A great present for our 2-year old who loves it to bits.  It's sturdy& full of detail to keep him amused and looks the real deal."
6829,2183,5," This toy arrived on time for my grandson's 6th birthday. He started playing with it straight away& rather than other& more expensive toys that he had been given. It is robust and he loves it."
6830,2183,5," This was a christmas present for my 4 year old nephew. Unlike many of his presents this one was easy to open& didnt fall apart or require a engineering degree to put together.with the matching figurines he has been playing with them for a lot of the day.Figurines"
6831,2183,5," Happy Birthday present...the child liked it very much! infact they both did& started fighting over it straight away& was Great fun to watch....."
6832,2183,5," Arrived alot sooner than expected& especially as it was out of stock. Very pleased and this is the only thing my son has asked for this Christmas."
6833,2183,2," poor quality&  cheap looking& not good value child not impressed would not buy again&needed a figure in car to be a good play toy"
6834,2183,5," Bought this toy for my grandson 4 year old& he's mad about batman man& he absolutely loves it& would certainly. recommend it."
6835,2183,5," very quick delivery  nice size very study  its a christmas pressie for my nephew so i think he will enjoy playing with this"
6836,2183,5," Perfect& no complaints& apart from my little boy who was disappointed to find there was no batman inside"
6837,2184,5," Happy thanks"
6838,2184,5," perfect"
6839,2185,5," I paid Â£12 for this model and to be honest it is the type of model you would pay 30-40 pounds for. The model is very big& highly detailed and very striking when finished.There is no flash at all. The manual is highly complex over 55 steps. The model is very complicated to make due largely to the fact that you have to paint& transfer the transfers and detail before assembly which is unusual for a build.You build the interiors first before you insert into the hull and then i would recommend doing a dry fit before final assembly.If you are into modelling& this is great build with experience. If you are starting out or have not alot of experience& then i recommend you stay away from this model.This model is undervalued in my opinion and should be more expensive.The subject is the William bauer& excuse my spelling& which was built by the Nazis  at the end of world war 2 and was the most advance submarine in the world at the time having a maximum speed of 17 knots under water and could styed submerged for long periods of time unlike it predecessors. It was basically the marine version of the me-162& if it was unleashed in time it could have won the war for the Nazis as it could avoid depth charges easily. The Nazis scuttled it and was raised and restored 12 years later.So an interesting subject matter as well.Very cheap price for a great kit and is an eye stopper."
6840,2185,5," Excellent detail and quality.  as a regular model builder I enjoy a challenge.  This meets all those requirements and should keep me occupied for some time."
6841,2185,5," Most enjoyable kit of an hugely important design.  As something of a painter I most enjoyed mixing thinners and pigments to create the subtle (dis)coloured greys of the hull of a boat which had actually been in seawater.  To that extent& I would rather have had the version with the full hull (i.e without the cutaway hull and interior)& but apparently& this version is no longer made or available.  Pity."
6842,2185,5," An excellent kit I really enjoyed building it& I usually only like ships but this caught my eye as you can see the inside."
6843,2185,5," have done this model before just wanted to do it again as looks great when finished"
6844,2185,4," This was a present and the recipient was happy to receive it"
6845,2185,5," I am a 65 year old born again youth& who has got back into modelling since I retired. I bought this model back in February. It arrived quickly and was well packaged and I am thoroughly enjoying making it up. It is a complicated kit and is presenting a challenge to me. The sprues are clear of flashing& and although the instructions are far from perfect& by dry fixing and looking ahead regularly& the kit is coming together. I am working on about 5 models of different types and feel that I am learning quickly.As an aside& I am astounded at the number of reviews I read where people don't realise that they are buying a kit or get annoyed because no paints or glue are included. All I can suggest is READ THE ADVERT.Amazon provides an amazing service at competitive prices - I will return time and time again."
6846,2185,5," Came in good condition...and very satisfied"
6847,2186,5," OK"
6848,2187,5," Loved by my 4 year old. Fast delivery"
6849,2187,5," Opened today by my grandson loves it"
6850,2187,5," Great vehicle and good size"
6851,2188,5," Great"
6852,2189,5," fantastic genuine Disney Plane"
6853,2190,5," bought this for our grandson for christmas& so it's only had a quick test& everything seems okay& quality appears to be good and it certainly moves at great speed. we are certain he will be more than pleased."
6854,2190,1," Dose not work at all got top brad battery's still dose not work & cost a lot of money then to open it on my sons birthday for him to be upset because it dose not work"
6855,2190,5," An absolute bargain!  Cheapest I have found on the internet.  Not used it yet as it's an xmas gift but I am very pleased."
6856,2190,5," My grandson's favourite Christmas present."
6857,2191,5," Its the dogs nuts"
6858,2192,5," My son was brought this for his 5th birthday and loves it he attaches everything to the hook you can move the crane up and down and spin it around and he has spent hours playing with it. Very sturdy& good quality& nothing has broken after a year. Well worth the money and he now has the Log Zimber Truck too."
6859,2192,5," We're very impressed with this toy- it looks great&is simple and well built. We thought it a bit expensive& but have changed our tune- it feels like it will outlast us! Will definitely buy the Bruder brand again. Our young builder loves it."
6860,2192,5," My 6 year old loves playing with this crane (and I caught his dad and older sister having fun with it too!). The moveable and extendable parts are good. We don't often spend this much on a toy& but this one is worth it - especially if you have a younger child to pass it on to in due time.Update - 18 months on and he's still playing with it. (2012)"
6861,2192,5," Bought this as a Christmas present for my 3 year old lad and i am very very happy with it. It is very well made& no flimsy plastic that breaks if you look at it. Crane arm extends quite a way which i thought my lad would find a way then to break when at its weakest& not a chance with this! Well worth the money i paid for it& highly recommended. I bought the extra light and sounds module with this& set of blue and orange lights with the truck horn& engine sounds and police siren. Looks a little wierd now my lad has the blue lights flashing and the police siren roaring as he pushes the crane about& but hey he is over the moon with it."
6862,2192,5," My 3 yr old grandson has an ever growing fleet of Bruder toys and the crane is& so far& the favourite with loads of features and moving parts to keep him happy& I might have to buy another to keep at our house for when he visits (and for me to play with as well)."
6863,2192,5," Much better condition than expected& arrived the next day& my grandson aged 4 loves it& I have made buckets"
6864,2192,3," Ok I am actually quite surprised at the totally positive reviews for this toy. It is a good toy that my son likes but it has a few flaws. We also had an issue with the product that arrived. So firstly the main drivers unit of the lorry lifts up in a very realistic way to reveal the engine. It is a nice touch but when my son tries to push the crane along the floor it inevitably lifts up& which is frustrating for him. A more secure locking mechanism or something would be better. You can't push from the back due to the crane module which is obviously turns 360 degrees.Second issue was that the support legs for the crane arrived broken. I really didn't want to send it back for such a small thing especially as my son was so happy with his reward for potty training but it was a  bit annoying.summary:crane works greatlooks greatdifficult to push arounddoors don't openpart broken on arrivalNothing world endingly bad but I might have stretched to the more expensive Scania model if I knew what I knew now."
6865,2192,5," Bought for my grandson for Christmas.  He played with it from the moment he opened it and every day since. As he has only had it for 6 days I cannot comment properly on durability but it appears to be fairly robust."
6866,2193,3," The product is ok but this image is very misleading.  It looks like the gift pack contains 3 tractors which is what we thought when ordering them."
6867,2193,5," Bought for the autistic child I transport to school"
6868,2193,2," very small & thought it will be bigger"
6869,2193,5," Grandson loves them"
6870,2194,5," Thumbs up for this. Even the question of how educational this toy is got a five start. My son wanted to know about the name& where it came from& what the flag looks like etc. durability is top as well as there are a lot of car crashes in our versions of cars and cars two. It is amazin how something so small can bring such happiness but it also leads to the | what's next| comments. Oh no."
6871,2195,5," Sons birthday present absolutely delighted with it another plane to his collection"
6872,2195,4," Excellent Xmas present"
6873,2196,5," as described &very well packed excellent service. I have a blue/yellow 'Bira' version& this adds to collection. any others available?"
6874,2197,5," well pleased arrived on time as stated and am very happy all round"
6875,2197,5," great product just what i wanted"
6876,2197,5," Good addition many thanks"
6877,2197,5," Great truck"
6878,2197,5," bril"
6879,2198,4," Decent model& better than Airfix kits with clear instructions and good finishedproduct. I would say intermediate skill level required with some small parts difficult to place exactly.Really enjoyed painting and making it and would buy again.Recommended."
6880,2198,5," Great kit& easy to make but some fiddly parts to assemble.  I suppose that's why we make them.  The overall finish is good with numerous u.boat colour schemes and boats which served the German navy."
6881,2198,5," This is a fantastic kit and great value for the price.Crisp detail and a straight forward build. Really looks the business."
6882,2198,5," Spot on& my very own U boat - a well detailed model& enough parts to make it fun but not over complicated either."
6883,2198,3," A bit Tricky to make.Were is he Deck Gun.But a good model."
6884,2198,5," Really good model was delivered on time no issues would use again."
6885,2199,5," Brilliant&well made&extremely tough&scale model truck&well detailed equivalent Emek Volvo truck will cost 70-90 pounds&well worth the money"
6886,2200,2," Kids were going crazy for this after watching it for months on youtube.  They're pricey but eventually they earned it and I bought it.  Unfortunately the colour shifting car stopped colour shifting after a couple of weeks.  Not sure why.  Just stopped in between orange and white - spotty and useless.  I always buy hotwheels as quality is almost always excellent.  This however is not.  It's pointless without the colour shifting and is now ignored."
6887,2200,1," Awful!! Is really tiny and doesn't really do anything defiantly not worth the price"
6888,2200,5," My child loves this toy& he is mad on cars in particular hot wheels and this track seems to be his favourite."
6889,2200,5," Great product and service"
6890,2201,5," very good quality& connect up to my 1.32 scale trailer and The paint work and detail is very good& this is the genuine newray product and correct size as stated  on website unlike another company i used&Thanks mr lucas"
6891,2202,5," second to none..."
6892,2203,5," Prompt delivery& Arrived undamaged and as expected!Birthday present for BF& he loved it as it was more about the paint job than the putting together. Many thanks!"
6893,2203,5," Great submarine model& granted not many parts but makes up to a wonderful scale boat& soon to be working hopefully! you will not be disappointed with the size or quality of the model."
6894,2203,5," Beautiful model& not much to it granted but the massive size of it& it's huge! longer than my pc desk and looks good when finished& a bargain for the price"
6895,2203,5," good product"
6896,2204,4," Very good kit but not as good as the tamya equivalent but still good though& plastics a bit thinner on this"
6897,2204,5," Intricate but great fun& bought for my Grandson for Xmas"
6898,2205,5," I bought this for my Cars mad little boy.  It was cheaper on Amazon than all of the other websites and had free delivery too - bonus!  He loves it& it looks really good& just like the movie& and is actually quite durable as it gets taken everywhere even in the bath and had held up really well!  It's excellent quality and I would recommend this."
6899,2205,4," Just the right size for my 18mth old to hold in his hand yet moves at great pace across the carpet to squeals of delight. Not small child friendly so watch it doesn't get chewed! Delivered promptly and nicely parcelled as usual."
6900,2205,5," I bought it for my two year old who loves the car films - he loves it and has failed to damage or destroy it & so basically it did what is was bought for perfectly"
6901,2205,5," my grandson loves mater this is the right size to carry round& Its well made and the detail is good. Has stood up to being thrown around quite a bit."
6902,2205,5," This Toy was so cute and very well made.My little nephew loved it so much.I would not hesitate to buy again because of the super quality."
6903,2205,5," Munson is obsessed with cars and mater being a particular favourite. He takes him everywhere be it car& shopping or bed!"
6904,2205,5," The picture and description is exactly what I received in the post. My nephew was delighted with Mater and I would highly recommend it for others to purchase& plus it arrived exactly when stated. Perfect buy."
6905,2205,3," But disappointed. Smaller than I was expecting and the packaging is different to that shown-doesnt show the 'Cars 2' logo at the top left corner. Hoping this is now the right one for my nephew."
6906,2206,5," got this for friends who have a retro cabin in garden& they love it& as do I. well made little reminder."
6907,2207,5," My four year old son is car mad. He loved these well packaged and very good quality. Tip here after buying these saw same set in Tesco mega store in Coventry for Ten pounds.That said the review is about the product and it's spot on and makes my boy smile. How much is that worth?"
6908,2207,5," Mygrandson was so pleased with these cars"
6909,2207,5," ðŸ‘"
6910,2208,5," Product fantastic"
6911,2208,5," Much cheaper"
6912,2208,5," Great item"
6913,2209,5," dashingly good"
6914,2210,2," This is OK as a toy car goes and my little girl loves Postman Pat so she's happy but for the price it's fairly awful quality. The back doors don't open at all (they aren't designed to)& and the side doors are very stiff and difficult to open. I think you'd be better off with another product this is too much money for too little quality."
6915,2210,1," In case you were wondering& you push this along& let go and it uses a build of momentum type stuff and scuttles along. Quite fun. If the was bought for me then I'm sure this would be fine. I would push the van with a steady but sure hand and then gleefully watch Pat and cat whizz along my carpet. However& this was not bought for me& it was bought for my 2 yr 10 mth daughter who on the 2nd or 3rd push broke it. There is a sealed box inside with a series of plastic cogs and so when pushed with some fury they break straight away. It's then just a plastic van. With Pat. And a cat."
6916,2210,3," Badly made and will not give it to our grandson yet as we feel it will break very easily. Our children had a super Postman Pat van 28 years ago& which was so well made and is still in good condition."
6917,2210,5," This is the best friction vehicle I have come across.  We have a through lounge and with just one gentle push it will go from one end of the room to the other!  Makes a lovely satisfying noise as it goes too.  My son has played with this non-stop since he was 20 months old (now 2.5) and it has no bumps& scratchs and still looks brand new.  Would highly recommend."
6918,2210,2," Very frustrating. Pat falls over as if drunk when the van is propelled forwards. Unless Jess is next to him in the van that is. Sometimes maybe Pat would like to leave Jess behind on a cat based adventure. Anyway I am pretty sure the DVLA doesn't issue licences continent on you travelling with a cat to remain upright.Jess has a hole in her base to enable her to stay in place& Pat doesn't and I can't understand why as this would be anatomically correct."
6919,2210,3," My three years old son got this van for Christmas and really appreciated it. Unfortunately he immediately noticed the fact that doors can't open so well& it seems like plastic will break as you play few times with it as it is very thin and light....however....it is still Intact!. Fiction mechanism is well Made and very funny."
6920,2210,2," the product was damaged when it arrived which was v frustrating considering the Â£6 p and p cost. a wheel had fallen off and as soon as we'd fixed it and my son began playing with it a different wheel fell off."
6921,2210,3," This was not as expected& It is not as good finish as the picture suggests. the mirrors had bits of paper stuck on to represent glass but they were not even stuck on square."
6922,2211,4," The only thing I didn't like - a very small size of station& I  expected something bigger.  I would recommend it as a present."
6923,2212,5," Grandsons absolutely LOVES this.  Really fun product although |to the dump| song repetitive ......more about how much he played with it than song.  Goes forward quickly& plays tune& bin |empties| and lights flash.  Great product."
6924,2212,5," This is greal for boy or girl. Just love the song it plays. Very robust."
6925,2213,3,""
6926,2213,5," Great for when my grandchildren pop in they canlay it on the table and play to their hearts content.  Plastic not very thick but I don't think it will easily rip."
6927,2213,4," WAS FOR NEPHEN AS HURT HIS FINGERS AND THEY HAVE HAD FUN WITHIT& WAS OK FOR THE PRICE AS PLASTIC BUT FOLDS UP AND PACKS AWAY"
6928,2213,5," Great for popping in to party bags and for little treats. Good value for money."
6929,2213,4," I like this as it is easy to clean so dont need to worry about any spillages."
6930,2213,4," My 4yr old loves these car added nicely to his extensive car collect."
6931,2213,3," Low prices& but not the best quality. A bit cheap and plasticky."
6932,2213,2," alot smaller and cheaper looking than expected- disappointed"
6933,2214,2," Firstly let me say that this item was cheap& delivered on time and well packaged. However on inspection I failed to find any diecast parts in either the car or the caravan& the only metal I was able to see was the wheel axles which are of a stiff stainless steel wire rod and part of the wheel construction and four srews holding the parts together. However our grandson really likes this toy and for that reason I gave it four stars for education and fun& but"
6934,2214,5," What does the guy expect for Â£6 &the real thing? The postage alone must have been a couple of quid& and say Â£2 each for car and caravan&I think it's a very good set."
6935,2214,4," Grand child  liked it . It could be improved if there were more opening doors etc. Not many caravans for children for sale so was pleased to find"
6936,2214,4," My 5 year is very pleased with it& got the red but would have preferred the green so a choice would have got 5 stars"
6937,2214,5," Perfect - it was exactly what was expected."
6938,2214,5," Excellent value toy at a reasonable price"
6939,2215,3," I had high hopes for this toy. I was looking for well made wooden vehicles with a variety of classic and recognisable vehicles for a younger child.The print quality of the paint on wood was not brilliant. The colours were dull and even patchy in places - almost as if it needed a sealing undercoat as the pain had sunk in too much.The vehicles are a nice size for smaller hands - but the wheels do tend to stick and do not roll freely on many surfaces. Rubbish on carpet or soft vinyl.He has played with them and does like them - just not as bright and colourful or as |mobile| as I had hoped."
6940,2215,3," These cars were brought to take on holiday abroad for my 2 year old...they were thoroughly loved and made the flight journey durable for him.  Although my only criticism is that the paint has flaked off just after 1 week but this certainly has not effected my son playing with them& plus even his 11 month old brother."
6941,2215,5," I think this is a great purchase& fantastic value& well made sturdy toys would recommend buying this item!"
6942,2215,4," Good toy for a 3 year old& but price found cheaper elsewhere (in a toystore) afterwards."
6943,2215,5," I bought this set because I kind of want to mix my son's toy collection with some wooden toys which look nicer and are as much fun for him to play with. He's 2 1/4 and likes to point out the different types of vehicles. Would make a good gift and very reasonably priced."
6944,2215,3," My brothers kids had some of these a few years ago and they still look great today& sadly the paint job these days is rubbish.  Very very poor indeed. My boy loves these& they are great...but like other wooden toy cars I have bought for him recently I would say that I expect for that money a much& much better paint job. Its just not good enough and I would not pay that price for that product again."
6945,2215,4," I bought this set of toy vehicles to complement the Le Toy Van Playmat and as you would expect they go with it very well. I much prefer 'old school' style toys that are usually made out of wood as oppose to plastic toys& as they have the potential to last longer and be more durable. The quality of these toys is very good indeed& and there is also a good variety of different types of vehicle meaning that you can invent all sorts of different scenarios with your little ones. Something for everyone.At the time of the review my 4 and 2 yr old have played with these toys a lot and really enjoy them& and despite a lot of play-time with them they show very little wear indeed. Being wood they are almost indestructible& but what is particularly pleasing is that the paint has not chipped off at all. They look as good as new!The only bad thing about toys like this is that in the wrong hands they are deadly weapons!! These toys can do some damage if thrown around or somebody gets hit by them& but of course that would be true of all wooden toys.Buy these& they are good!!"
6946,2215,5," Gr8 value for money and fast delivery"
6947,2216,5," lovely litte model"
6948,2217,5," Great Thanks"
6949,2217,4," My kid loved"
6950,2218,5," My grandson was so delighted with this that apparently insisted on taking it to bed with him so obviously a great hit. He lives on a farm so is farm machinery mad This like other Bruder toys seems to be tough and well made"
6951,2219,5," good."
6952,2220,3," A rather clunky model& something is just not quite right& the fuselage seems a bit too thick as do the wings. The propellers are locked solid so would quickly be damaged if played with ."
6953,2220,5," This is an excellent replica of one of the greatest aircraft of world war two. This is a constant reminder of what we owe in terms of our freedom to the brave pilots who flew them."
6954,2220,5," Beautifully made product& detailed and accurate. Bought for my desk t work. looks then part. stand also very sturdy a"
6955,2220,5," Fabulous model & superbly recreated in miniature& one of the best models that I have seen of a mosquito fighter."
6956,2220,5," Excellent customer service and product was exactly as described and completed my needs well done"
6957,2220,5," xmas present for son in law brill packaging excellent"
6958,2221,5," My Grandson has not stopped playing with it since I bought it him 10 months ago.I like to leave 'comments' till after a trial period (although 10 months is a bit excessive)Fiddly at first to set up and I wasn't even sure I had got it right after that :-)Has endured 10 months play. It's been non-stop fun .... no ... not for me ... well ... perhaps just a little bit .... well you do for the kids don't you?:-)"
6959,2221,5," Brilliant seller. Fast postage& excellent price compared to all the others I was looking at. My son absolutely loved it for his birthday he has has sooo much fun playing with it. I wasn't expecting it to be as big as it is or as good quality for the price so was pleasantly suprised when it arrived (early). Would buy off this seller again with no hesitation. One happy birthday boy= one happy mommy. Thank you"
6960,2221,1," I wanted either a garage or a mack for my son who is a Cars fanatic.  This toy looked to be a stunning combination of both in theory& but in practice the clock part won't stay in place so any slight bump and it falls apart.  The rest works pretty well& but that part is very& very disappointing - for me it was a total waste of money!"
6961,2221,5," Brillant my son loves this toy. Wouldn't of paid any more but good for the price.My sons had hours if fun play with this."
6962,2221,5," My grand son was delighted and has spent hours of playing. Recommended to my friends. Thank you so very much"
6963,2221,5," Not seen in shops. A real fun toy that does lots of tricks"
6964,2221,2," I was disappointed with the clock section as it does not firmly sit in the groove.  It is better closed as Mac than open.  Good idea in theory but not practically."
6965,2222,4," Not as big as I thought it would be but will actually be ideal for the space left in a room full of muppets things!"
6966,2222,4," So cute!!!!"
6967,2223,5," Amazing! This is a very large and brilliantly detailed toy. My 4 year old is obsessed with construction vehicles and this one didn't disappoint"
6968,2223,5," Real quality toy which my nephew loves. Would have loved one myself 40 years ago!"
6969,2224,4," Son loves it& quirky little model car with cone on nose."
6970,2224,4," grandson loved this car"
6971,2225,5," brought this on offer  wouldn't pay full price but make a good cheap addition to the bruder set& don't pay full price as will be disappointed."
6972,2225,5," very cheap&great product"
6973,2226,2," I bought these as a cake decoration so my 2 year old grandson to play with after.They looked really good and was initially happy with my purchase.I wouldn't recommend these as the have started to fall apart only a couple of weeks after his birthday"
6974,2226,1," Disappointed set-very small cars and paint comes off easily"
6975,2226,5," Have bought other products from Le Toy before and& as ever& I am completely happy with the product. Sturdy& quality pieces offering immediate play opportunities - Mum and son both happy. Definitely recommend this company."
6976,2226,5," I'm not sure how durable they will prove to be over time but... from the second they were opened they have become the favourite toys of a digger mad 2 year old."
6977,2226,5," very pleased with purchase& was a good price and was swiftly delivered& the item was well packaged& excellent"
6978,2226,5," A very nice toy set. My son who is 3 truly enjoys playing with it every time. Highly recumbent it."
6979,2226,5," My 2 year grandson loves this set. And that says it all."
6980,2227,5," I got a lot of james bond corgis but got say at moment this is best one i got so far"
6981,2228,5," Nice model car. My son loves it although its a slightly bigger scale than his other model cars but this has been a very elusive car to find for his collection so I'm very grateful!"
6982,2228,5," It arrived 2 days late but is lovely and my son will love it for christmas.......the plastic case is hard plastic which makes it look a bit special"
6983,2228,5," Had to have this for grandson's collection if only for the name All adults love it Grandson aged five over the moon"
6984,2228,5," Really great model"
6985,2229,4," My son now has several Bruder toys and all are excellent& he loves all these and this loader is one of his favorites. Well built and recommended."
6986,2229,4," Bought this for my boy. He loves it. We love it....perhaps me more than him. I'll stop now before I work myself up and buy |him| an entire earth-moving armada."
6987,2230,5," Grandson pleased with this transformer."
6988,2231,5," Good product"
6989,2232,4," I bought this for my 3 year old son& he absolutely loves it. It's huge& detailed and has proper tracks and it even comes with little rubber attachments& so the tracks can work on polished floors. So far nothing has broken and that's even with outside play& digging dirt! I will definitely be buying more from the Bruder range as they're well worth the money."
6990,2232,5," My grandson is what we all call digger mad and he loved this excavator&sorry digger.It&s bright&strong and does everything it says on the box.Highly recommended if your into diggers."
6991,2232,5," Had already purchased the one with wheels for my other son. They now often have a 'debate' over who has the one with tracks! My youngest son often carries this one round so that he get first dibs on it... These toys are really well built - do have in mind the size of them - in a small house / bedroom they may take over a bit."
6992,2232,4," Good robust toy& will be fun in the summer digging in the sand pit.  Easy for my son to use who is 5& he enjoys it."
6993,2232,5," Bought this to go with a Back hoe loader. It is a tremendous model with great detail and a handgrip to manoeuvre the bucket& my son loves it."
6994,2232,3," Good simulator. My little one liked it. But crawler tracks came off after some time and you need to put them back over and over again. Not strong enough and brakes easily hence I think it is not wort the money- too expensive."
6995,2232,5," |Wow a digger& thank you Father Christmas|& those were the words from my nearly 3 year old grandson when he opened the wrapping around the big box.  he played with it all day so what more can I say."
6996,2232,5," Got this for my son as he loves diggers.  Its big and durable and can dig outside."
6997,2233,5," My 3 year old loves this tractor its hardy and the front part great for putting his bales etc in a well worth purchase for a tractor mad child."
6998,2233,5," great toy from bruder once again the workings of this forklift are lifelike and is well made my son plays for hours with the toys from bruder"
6999,2234,5," There have been & and are & better 1/72 scale kits available of the B-24 . Nonetheless this Airfix version & first released in the early 1960s & still stands the test of time very well . It has Airfixs characteristic 1960s obsession with moving control surfaces and an over-application of over scale rivets & but these are minor irritations quite easily dealt with . What this kit has always had is 'the look' of the B-24 & which other manufacturers have often failed to capture . Makes into an impressive model for which many alternative aftermaket decal sheets exsist . Falcon vac-formed transparencies transform this model and reward efforts at internal superdetailing"
7000,2234,4," very good build lots of tricky bits to it& but well worth the time and effort &good fun and :)"
7001,2234,5," I ordered this because it was one of the few American aircraft that I hadn't got in my collection& and& as usual& I am pleased with the model. I particularly like the choice of markings and it's the first four engined aircraft in my collection.  My only tiny quibble is the fact that Airfix don't& as yet& make the Boeing B17."
7002,2234,5," Bought on someone else's behalf he is happy with it"
7003,2235,5," Plan toys for the win! Love the wood& love the rubber tires! Another plan toys favorite!"
7004,2235,5," excellent purchase"
7005,2236,5," Actually very pleasantly surprised at how nice this wee car is! The picture does not do it any justice. super detail and looks super cool ðŸ˜Š arrive early too!! Always a bonus!!"
7006,2236,1," Very dissapointed in this car as it was bought for a birthday presentWhich I won't be given it is tiny and not worth the money save your money andBuy something better&& total rip off!!! Not impressed"
7007,2236,5," My son loves it"
7008,2236,5," Dreat"
7009,2237,5," Received on time. Well packaged. The product itself though is incredible. As a novice plane collector& this is perfect for more my collection. Looks the part as well. The entire model is made out of a very high quality feeling metal& except the cockpit bubble. That is plastic.It is very hard t find a Meteor model/toy. So when I saw this& I knew it would be perfect. For anyone wondering& it's the F3 version that flew with 616 squadron No122 Wing in early 1945. The paint is incredibly well done as well. The |doodlebug| isn't what I got this model for& but it's a nice bonus to have. Both the Meteor and doodlebug have display stands with information and names of the aircraft on them. Both are 1:72 scale as well. Overall& very pleased with this model. Thanks very much Oxford Diecast."
7010,2237,5," excellent product& as described& good price& fast delivery& recommended  vendor"
7011,2237,5," well detailed and very evocative of that particular period in history."
7012,2237,5," This is a great model. Thank you very much. Peter fox"
7013,2238,4," My 4 year old son loves collecting the Cars 2 cars& most of which I have been able to pick up in local shops but there are some rare ones that are hard to find. He has most of the collection and this was the last world grand prix car that he needed so I paid the extra price for this one. My only gripe is the price of the diecast Cars 2 cars online against local stores& in a lot of cases they are 3-4 times dearer online and that doesn't take into account delivery costs. I ordered from Tekimoka-Uk and was very impressed with their delivery turnaround time and quality of product."
7014,2238,5," Bought as part of a gift for my youngest grandson for his 3rd birthday.  He loves the movie Cars and collects the cars.  Well made and being Die Cast will take the type of hammering that a 3 year old will throw at it."
7015,2238,5," Great product& the details are perfect& the colour reflects the exact replica of the movie! it's fun playing with it!"
7016,2238,5," I am sure our son will be delighted to get this from Father Christmas.  No doubt it will be played with lots!"
7017,2238,5," Good solid car as described the price was good not much else to say apart from my little boy loves it :-)"
7018,2239,5," Knowing it is a random choice of cars was a bit worry about what I would get.But I received absolutely great pack of 5 Corvets.And it fits our hot wheel track too.Pleased with purchase."
7019,2239,5," Judging from the expression of delight from my four-year old grandson& these cars were exactly perfect!  I used to buy Hot Wheels for my son when he was little"
7020,2239,5," I bough these cars for my child for Xmas. She likes it& it has vivid colours and of good quality so even after droppig it on the floor no damage to the cars."
7021,2239,5," Delivered and packaged well& this item was brought as part of a  birthday present for my Grandson I am sure he will enjoy playing with these cars as they were purchased together with the Hot wheel wall track& looks like a very interesting game&"
7022,2239,5," Excellent value and well relieved by my 2 year old nephew who absolutely loves little metal cars right now! Bought this pack with a hot wheels ramp and all in all it makes for a lovely birthday present."
7023,2239,5," This a a nicely presented gift set. The vehicles are in a vertical display& one on top of another in their own plastic sections within a blue cardboard box with a clear plastic front. It says 'customisers corner shop' on the front of the box and these vehicles are well decorated and look great.The vehicles I received don't look anything like the ones in the photo. The 5 I have are a 50's bronze coloured hotrod& a blue silver and red motorcycle& a burgundy pick up truck and 2 highly decorated sports cars (one orange and one green). The cars look a better selection than the Amazon photo and obviously contents of these packs may vary.Highly recommended. Makes a good gift."
7024,2239,5," I purchased a pack of these from Amazon directly to go with my little boy's Hot Wheel Nitro Bot Attack Set as the set only came with one car which wasn't fun on it's own.  Now the Nitro Bot can chomp on a car whilst holding one and ripping one up with the track while my son fires the other three cars at him to free the other cars and this has made such a difference to the play value of the other set.  The cars are brilliant& really nicely made and more importantly very robust as they have taken a battering over the last few months!The cars are made of some sort of metal and fit the Nitro Bot track perfectly although I believe from the back of the box that they may not be compatible with all Hot Wheels sets so it's probably worth checking before ordering.  I shall definitely be ordering more of these packs in the future as at just over Â£1 per car these are great and my son will definitely be expanding his Hot Wheels track collections."
7025,2239,4," Despite already owning possibly thousands of these little cars& it seems quantity is no factor here.  The recipient was overjoyed to receive them and they appear to be a valued addition to a rather large collection. From an adult point of view& these little die-cast toy cars are incredibly detailed and I think they are quite good value for money."
7026,2240,5," Perfeck"
7027,2241,5," Bought this for my collection. Very nice details and at a very reasonable price. It will certainly build into a nice replica of the Harrier."
7028,2242,4," Sturdy vehicle grandson loves it."
7029,2243,5," Grandson loves it"
7030,2244,5," Believe it or not these cars are not for a child.  My partner is an avid Star Wars fan and these little cars will thrill him and I even managed to purchase a Chewbacca one separately."
7031,2244,5," Great set picked up for a snip in a lightening deal&a must have for any star wars fan!"
7032,2244,4," these are expensive compared to most hotwheels cars but adverts win -they were enthusiastically accepted by Max (my grandson)"
7033,2244,5," Bought for nephew who is Star Wars mad he loved them"
7034,2244,5," good product &i bought when it was reduced as i am a big fan of Star war"
7035,2244,5," Normal Hot wheel size& and the boys love them"
7036,2244,5," Promised my grandson this for Christmas. Delivered on time and proved to value for money and much appreciated by my grandson&"
7037,2244,5," Good quality item great price purchased on Black Friday for my son for Christmas he's happy with them better than photo"
7038,2245,5," All as expected."
7039,2246,5," Bought this for my child's third birthday.  He absolutely loves it.  It's a good size and sturdy.  The cow is also a lovely size.  I'm so happy with this I'm going to buy another for my 18month old for Christmas."
7040,2246,3," Some bits break easily. Expect the gate to fall off on day one. Otherwise a Bruder fan."
7041,2247,1," A complete waste of money. It is made of the worst quality of plastic but my son was excited with it... For the first fifteen minutes. Then we realized that the only sturdy thing in the toy were the hinges which open and close the plastic cover that keeps the little cars in place. My four year old kept asking me to open it for him. After the first thirty times I was regretting ever purchasing it since it is impossible for the child to open it without assistant. Even for me& it wasn't exactly effortless to open it.  Eventually he got frustrated and tried to open it from the side without using the hinges on top.  The plastic cover was torn and besides the fact that now none of the little cars remained in place& he cut his hand too : (("
7042,2247,5," Bought as Christmas gift for grandson& looks fine to me& hope he likes it."
7043,2247,5," Arrived on time. Was exactly as described"
7044,2247,5," Looks fab great present for my grandson"
7045,2248,4," This is a lovely little model which has been ignored for a long time in diecast. It's a shame that the anti-spin strakes aren't modelled& although the upper and lower fuselage ariels are. Undersurface markings are sparse& and given that there are 'No Push' stencils on the tailplane& they could have also put them on the ailerons etc.It is a delicate model& and certainly not to be handled by anyone other than the collector/owner. A friend of mine moved my model gently and the tail wheel broke off. It really is very fine and delicate. Too fine to glue back on.I also think that it is too expensive& especially when you consider the price of Oxford Models."
7046,2249,5," Just the Olympic gift I wanted for a special gift to a child whose Dad got a Bronze Medal at Games"
7047,2249,4," nice toy"
7048,2249,5," Did not buy this item as a toy - Bought it as a keepsake as we are going to an Olympic Rowing event.  Very pleased with it."
7049,2250,5," Awesome car just a perfect gift"
7050,2251,5," Came with its own see through plastic display case which I didn't expect"
7051,2251,5," Excellent collectors model at an excellent price - well pleased !"
7052,2251,5," son loves it"
7053,2252,5," My grandson enjoys these products and I think they are good value for money. There are a great many more he would like so roll on his next birthday and Christmas ."
7054,2252,5," this toy is very realistic& and sturdy more so than some of the bruder farm bits. my twins love it"
7055,2252,5," I bought this for a 3 year old whom loves it. Its hardy and works well& great present !! !"
7056,2252,5," My grandson loves this& it matches the Bruder tractor which he got for his birthday"
7057,2252,5," Another sturdy Bruder product. Highly recommend this make."
7058,2252,5," Perfect for my 3 year old who obsessed with farms"
7059,2252,5," bought for my grandson& nice toys."
7060,2252,5," great toy arrived just in time"
7061,2253,5," cheap as chips"
7062,2254,1," I have to admit Smokey is quite cute.  My 5 year old son wanted Smokey for a very long time.  In my opinion he should come with a few more fire balls (I think it came with 4& so they go missing quite easily).  My son was really excited when he opened this present on Christmas morning and he hasn't played with it since.  Smokey doesn't really do much besides fire balls which you have to active yourself.  Could be better and overpriced!"
7063,2254,5," I bought this for my little grandson's second birthday he calls it his fya chuck.  I knew he would love it as when we go to his cousin's (who is 5 years older) he plays with the fya chuck.  At first the noises and dancing scared the life out of him but he slowly got used to it& then I realised when he was playing with his cousin's there was no batteries in the truck.  It is rather loud..glad to say that the little one loves shooting the balls all over the place though.  A fabulous toy for a little boy.. Recommended"
7064,2254,1," Purchased for 4 year old sons Christmas 2 years ago.  Occupied him for about 2 hours and then he was bored with it.  All it does is say funny things and fire balls from the cannon (and sort of go from vertical to horizontal).  It's too big to really be part of any other imaginative play with his other cars/trucks etc.It was what he wanted and he was happy on Christmas morning - but possibly the biggest waste of money we've ever spent on a present.  If your child wants this try to convince then to get something else."
7065,2254,5," At first he was surprised that it talked and the bumper moves like a talking fire truck and was put off at first & but now he loves it and has loads of fun but prefers it turned off for pushing it around on the floor as the front wheels don't open used that way."
7066,2254,5," My both grandsons loved this as I bought them one each early for XmasThey were priced well below High street value& however by the time Xmas came they were almost the same price."
7067,2254,5," what a fantastic toys.granson loves him.very hard wearing toy and hours of fun with lots of saying.but best of all love the way it raises up with talking"
7068,2254,4," Prompt service as expected from Amazon. Item exactly as described and was well received as a Christmas gift. Well made toy and well thought out."
7069,2254,5," For the cash - its not worth it - sorry - found out I could have got this item after it was given to the kit at half the amazon price too."
7070,2255,5," Fantastic additional to our little boy's bruder collection! Just what he needed for his New Holland tractor.Fits on easily"
7071,2255,4," As always& the toys from Bruder shows very good quality. My son likes to play with his Bruder toys& and they last over years"
7072,2255,5," This is a great addition to my boys growing bruder collection. You just have to double check you get the correct series."
7073,2256,5," bought this for my 16 months old daughter& she does not really play with dollies yet but likes cars so I though you cannot go wrong with this. The price is great& big toy shop was selling this for Â£29.99 so on Amazon we paid Â£18 so very very happy customer. The toy is great success& she loves playing with it and also rides on it. Fast delivery& ordered on Thursday and was delivered on Saturday."
7074,2256,5," Bought this mega block big truck for my grandsons 1st birthday& he loved it. First thing he did was to remove the driver from the cab and put it in his mouth.The construction of this item is very sturdy and there are no rough or sharp edges to cause any harm. It is an ideal gift for a child from 1to 5 years of age& and I would recommend this toy"
7075,2256,2," At first glance my daughter loved it and kept trying to climb on top of it until she realised it was too unbalanced to either push or sit on. She is 18 months. It has become somewhere to store toys. Sad because this could have become so much more. We bought it as she has a similar smaller truck she loves but this just wasn't the same."
7076,2256,5," Although my son is a bit young to play with it yet at five months oldI am sure he is going to love it. He is mesmerised by it when I push it along the floor in front of him. There are some blocks included& but I think you'd have to buy more to be able to do smething imaginitive wiht them."
7077,2256,5," Bought for Grandson's 1st birthday and he loves it. He can use it as a|toddle truck| standing up and pushing it. Just need to be careful he does this from the front (pushing truck backwards) rather than other way as otherwise it tends to tip up depositing grandson on the floor."
7078,2256,5," Bought this for my grandson who liked some mega blocks that we keep at home for him. As he also likes pushing things around this would suit him to the ground. He absolutely loved it so naturally we are very pleased. Thank you."
7079,2256,5," Well worth the money. This thing is huge. My 1.5yr old is going through this push everything around stage and this is ideal and as a bonus you get a little mega bloxs figure plus a fair few various size bloxs."
7080,2256,5," Bigger than I though& the wheels are big and chunky so easy to use inside and out and easy to clean and strong enough for my little one to put all his bits and bobs in and even lean on while pushing"
7081,2257,4," Fast delivery.  My son was very happy when this dragon  came.  He plays with it almost every day."
7082,2257,5," My 4year old will love this dragon! Our order vanished in the Christmas post but one email to the seller resulted in a speedy replacement sent which will make a little Dragon boy very happy this Christmas! Highly recommended."
7083,2257,1," complete rubbish...the wings move (unevenly) when you pull the legs...it is a waste of money...My grandson was underwhelmed and so was the rest of the family"
7084,2257,5," arrived quickly& looks really cool and detailed& not played with it yet as its a christmas prezzy but fingers crossed it will all work fine etc"
7085,2257,2," The dragon is a bit cheap. The wings don't really flap very well/easily& and stay in the 'up' position generally.. Which isn't what the kids want when flying it around the room.. Especially if the flapping action isn't easily done! Sorry! Wasn't massively impressed!"
7086,2257,3," Would have been lovely but one of the legs fell off on the first 2 minutes....have lost paperwork to send back.  Daughter disappointed but still managed to play with her 3 legged dragon without the wing action."
7087,2257,5," My grandson is going to love this dragon arrived in good time and in excellent condition. Great packaging. Great care taken impressed. Thanks."
7088,2257,2," Bit of a waste of money& difficult to make it fly my 5 yr old not really interested in it would rather have the fire breathing one."
7089,2258,4," I made the car but did not move. I found out if you remove pistons it works! Remove the piece in front of the pistons and take out the pistons. I have named it The car with no engine. The pistons are only there for show and they add friction. This review was written by my 13 year old son who got the kit for Christmas."
7090,2258,3," Didn't realise there would be so many parts - would need an adults to help assemble - Once made easy to use and hours of fun."
7091,2258,5," This is a first class product and very educational for the young children. It is easy to build following the instructions and works 100% as stated."
7092,2258,4," fixing the tyres was a problem....need special glue or adhesive to fix the rubber tyres...good design...and fun for people above 15 yrs."
7093,2258,3," Got this for my 8 year old son who loves building things and loves cars and seeing how they work. We spent a couple of hours building it which was quite easy for him to do with some guidance. We double checked everything and it was put together correctly& but when we used the salt water to make it run it didn't work. We went back through the troubleshooting page and double checked everything but it still didn't work. Okay as something to build but nothing more."
7094,2258,5," It was one of those Xmas presents which looked like a good idea as |something to do after lunch - and nothing to do with computers!|.  It was - on boxing day - and fitted the bill for my 12 yr old daughter... fun to build but like one of the other reviewers - the pistons needed to come out before it would move...More of a building exercise than an experiment.... but an experience I probably will repeat in a similar manner - so if you come across something please let me know!"
7095,2258,4," The car design needs refining. The engine parts are too heavy for the little motor but if taken it it works quite well. My nephew loved building it and seeing it work - a very clever idea! Needs a parent with a bit of know how to help. I have given it 4 starts because for the price it's quite excellent!"
7096,2258,5," My son is still plying with this four months after he got it& it takes no batteries& is cool and was a nice way for father and son to spend some time together building! I would say little kids wouldnt be able to build this all alone as there are loads of little parts but as I say was not a problem for us and actually I think my husband would have liked one as well!"
7097,2259,5," This was bigger than it looked and was even better than the picture. It was a present and proved to be a good choice. The item arrived on time and packaged well."
7098,2260,5," allit said it was and arrived on the day it said."
7099,2260,5," Grandson loved it.  Well packaged."
7100,2260,5," Great toy ðŸ˜Š"
7101,2260,5," Excelent"
7102,2261,5," Following a Christmas request for a Bruder tractor for my young nephew I searched high and low to find one of these tractors in various toy outlets with no success.  Then I tried Amazon and there it was!  Although I was apprehensive about ordering something like this that I hadn't seen& I needn't have worried. Consequently my nephew is absolutely delighted and has already had hours of fun playing with this sturdy large tractor& which hooks nicely onto the matching trailer another relative managed to acquire.  I anticipate that this is a toy that will last him for many years& will continue to bring plenty of hours of fun and well worth the money I paid for it. You therefore have a delighted nephew and a very satisfied aunt!"
7103,2261,5," The best of the Bruder toys we've purchased so far!!!  I can't believe this has survived falling off the kitchen table& falling off my son's lap in the car into the foot well& etc& etc& etc!!!  There isn't a mark on it and nothing has been broken off& so very very 4-year-old proof!!!  There is lots to keep him interested on this tractor - opening doors& steerable wheels& opening bonnet& height-adjustable tow bar& removable front weight& etc.  He has 8 wheels on his to make it extra special and is one of his pride-of-place toys!"
7104,2261,5," Another great Bruder toy for my son. Well build& robust& detailed and huge. He love's it. Would highly recommend. A great addition to an ever expanding fleet of Bruder tractors& trucks and trailers."
7105,2261,5," Great value for money"
7106,2261,5," Excellent tractor! Lovely size& very strong and well made. The doors and bonnet are designed to come off if opened too far& so they can be easily fixed back on instead of snapping or breaking. Really pleased with this!"
7107,2262,5," Something very different for creative girls. Brilliant idea for those that like something that is exclusive to them. The design is down to the individual"
7108,2262,5," Bought for Christmas present for Grandaughter she is very happy with this item there are lots and lots of items to use"
7109,2262,5," Great item and my 6 year old loved it - lots of fun. Kept my little one nice and quiet for ages and great bag that you can change inserts"
7110,2262,5," hours of fun for my daughter I now have badges everywhere! great for birthdays or Christmas present so go and get one !"
7111,2263,5," Well made and fairly heavy& got it for my little girl and she loves it. its taken some abuse and hasn't come apart at the stitching as yet. It makes an nice paperweight as well"
7112,2263,5," been waiting to get one ty for sending it just what  ineeded shame about the colour wanted the purple one but still great."
7113,2263,4," Nice colours thought the cat looked a bit odd but my daughter loves it."
7114,2263,5," Excellent item& my son loves it"
7115,2264,4," Excellent toyMy niece loved.It has an excellent quality& first quality material.Very very happy with the purchase.I recommend this toy for any child who loves Minnie"
7116,2264,5," My daughter loves it& we have a number of different size Minnie plush toys with this one being the largest and I must say for the money it is excelent value"
7117,2264,5," Grandchild loved getting this doll which was exactly what she wanted for Christmas.  They tell me it was a wonderful special gift for an almost 3 year old."
7118,2264,2," Came with a tare and not right size not happy sent back but havnt recieved money back yet or a message to say he recieved it also a rip off for the size of it"
7119,2265,5," My 7 year old daughter who is still into cuddly toys loves this!  It is well made& soft and the pink material on the neck and back has a little sparkle in it. Good value for money."
7120,2265,5," my daughter loves flamingo! She really loved it! Takes it everywhere!"
7121,2265,5," Lovely gorgeous flamingo. Children loved it."
7122,2265,5," small but very cute"
7123,2266,5," Awesome bag& good size"
7124,2267,5," A great present to give with a DVD of one of the Muppet movies made everyone laugh on Christmas day. The little fellow was well made and very cuddly"
7125,2267,5," great srevice bear as described and good price will trade with you again  in the future because of this thanks"
7126,2268,5," My son absolutely loves it&it's excellent"
7127,2268,3," Bought for little boy as he needed a night light. It's brilliant but the light does not stay on unfortunately. Not sure if was described in description."
7128,2268,1," The only reason I did not return it was because my son tore the packet& a complete waste of money . It doesn't interact with kids at all."
7129,2268,5," Great item for my baby."
7130,2269,5," My daughter chose this for herself as a present when she turned 4. Of all the things you could get in the toyshop& this for some reason really appealed to her. It could be the soft fur and the eyelashes& or the crown and cute little skirt& who knows? Now& 5 months later& she still plays with it and it is definitely one of her favorite toys. It makes some very cute noises too& nothing too unbearable for the parent though. My daughter would definitely recommend this little doggy toy."
7131,2269,5," This is a lovely looking toy for small kids& it doesn't make many sounds& it doesn't do a lot either but has great accessories and little girls will love it just by looking at it. Its very soft and well made too& other sites are selling it for triple the price so amazon is the best place."
7132,2270,5," Brought this and had it sent straight to my grandson who turned 5 &he absolutely loves it&he showed it to me via FaceTime and it looks amazing bigger than I thought really great buy and amazing value&delivery was brilliant arrived earlier than date stated.Couldn't be happier"
7133,2270,4," I saw this on a special deal here and decided to purchase a number of these for gifts for my nephews& plus 2 young children for their first and 2nd birthday subsequently.  I donâ€™t know what I was expecting when I ordered them& but because of the price I was anticipating them being rather small.  I was mistaken!  When they arrived the packaging was HUGE.  I pity my poor next door neighbour who took it in at my weekend place- she had to store it for a few days.  One thing I really find frustrating with Amazon is that packing is often damaged.  It doesnâ€™t matter when the product is for yourself& but when it is a gift even when there is just a small tear in the outer packaging it looks unprofessional.  Unfortunately this was the case here& and the box was ripped.  The product did arrive much sooner than the stated delivery date which was good.The product itself was a great size- really large& although the book that it was holding is quite small& and not attached particularly well.  It does look of good quality though& and it certainly doesnâ€™t look cheap.  I have already given one of them as a gift for a 2 year old& and they LOVED it.  They started cuddling the rabbit straight away& and then sat there rapt whilst listening to the story.  I havenâ€™t seen the TV show but my friend did say that the voice sounds exactly like it& so that was good.  There seemed to be a variety of different tales available& and they are different each time so they will capture a childâ€™s imagination.  The one problem you might encounter is that if they like one particular story you donâ€™t seem to be able to have the option to repeat it.  I am sure that wouldnâ€™t be an issue though.Although the recommended age for this is older I do think it would be suitable for much younger children.  My nephews are both 1 and one of them in particular loves stories and books so I have no doubt that he will be happy to sit there and take it in."
7134,2270,5," Another lovely peter rabbit product& very happy with it& you can remove the journal for cuddles with peter at night as well my son loves it"
7135,2270,5," Really love this. Good quality product.Bought this for daughters 4th birthday.  She's going to be over the moon. Peter tells a different tale each time the book is opened. daughter is a hugh peter rabbit fan and this will be a great addition to her collection.  Would highly recommend for any young fan of the tv show."
7136,2270,5," Fantastic& my 2yr old LOVES this Peter rabbit& she sits and listens to his stories and the soft Peter has been to bed with her everynight since he arrived thank you"
7137,2270,3," Bit disappointing.  The talking element is the plastic book which is velcroed to Peters hands.  little boy does like it for short periods of time"
7138,2270,5," My daughter can't read and is enjoying this book.  She loves Peter Rabbit"
7139,2270,3," Very good& only downer was the packaging was ripped that Peter rabbit was placed in& so now have to give it as a present like that"
7140,2271,4," unfortuantelt mine arrived damaged& the beans were spilling out. Amazon were great though and refunded me and told me to throw away due to the nature of the problem and it wasnt safe. i got one of these elsewhere incase of dame problem and it is a great product..."
7141,2271,5," Hubby got me this as I had put it on his wish list& I looked forward to cuddling it on the sofa and in bed to save on heating bills and the smell of lavender. It heats really well in the microwave& is gorgeously soft and smells devine.The only problem is my kids want it too. My two year old son laughs when he sees it& sighs when he cuddles it and sleeps with it most nights. His sister trys pinching it too!I hope to add two more to the wish list& so we each have one& and add to it our winter night time routine& a warm mouse to cuddle and relax us at night. I hope I then won't have to put electric heaters on in the kids room at night."
7142,2271,5," Bought  as  a  gift  for  a  friend's  Christmas  -  is  really  good  quality  -  arrived  in  good  condition  even  though  a  previous  review  had  received  a  damaged one"
7143,2272,5," this is a great toy and i love how it talks and it sounds thank you :) It has brought a smile to my friends face"
7144,2273,4," Thankyou my grand-daughter Christmas present sure she will love it ."
7145,2274,5," Grandson loved this& as he does all the Gruffalo characters& well made& and just the right size. Watch out for all the different size scales these come in& there are 3 different ones. You'll need to go for a medium or large Gruffalo if you buy this size  squirrel& otherwise Gruffalo ends up the same size as squirrel&  and that just won't do!"
7146,2274,4," My Grandson is mad on the Gruffalo.  From the age of 2 years he loves the story and knows it by heart.  He have been collecting the characters so he can reinact the story himself.  The toy is nicely made& soft and the face shows great character."
7147,2274,5," My granddaughter now has the complete set of gruffalo characters and seeing her retell the story gives us as much pleasure as it does her. For any child that enjoys the story having the characters is a must."
7148,2274,5," Aurora the squirrel is a delightful addition to my grandsons already growing collection. The Gruffalo is a wonderful educational story and the soft toys just add to the pleasure."
7149,2274,5," One excited little girl when this arrived& and that was just me. He's a little on the small side& but my squirrel obssessed two year old thinks he's the squirrel's n..."
7150,2274,5," This toy was brought to complete a collection of Gruffalo toys for my 4yr old son& which he loves& he uses it to retell the story now with the characters."
7151,2274,5," Lovely toy& exactly as expected. 2 year old adores it& has since gone back to all the Julia Donaldson books to find her squirrel in the pictures."
7152,2274,4," Somewhat expensive for a soft toy but beautifully made and a perfect representation of the squirrel from Julia Donaldson's amazing Gruffalo story"
7153,2275,5," really great item my kids loved them and they were so cheap would 100% recommend make great party bag toys too"
7154,2275,5," My daughter loves  her finger puppets. Good price compared to others I bought. VeryHappy with my purchase from yourselves"
7155,2275,5," Finger puppets for the children and adults all you need is a stage and your good to go. Great for Developing a Child's Imagination and Creativity"
7156,2275,5," Bought as a stocking filling and can't complaint! Brilliant value& little girl loves them& great addition to her puppet theatre!"
7157,2275,5," Great while feeding her... keeps her busy in the car.... I have to put a voice on and I'm sure she knows its me but she still loves it!"
7158,2275,5," Thank you so much for the puppets. Each family member is distinguishable& with cute details like the tie on the fathers shirt and the bun in the grandmothers hair. My kids loved them straight away.. aged 2 and 4. Definitely worth the money for the effort put into them. Don't know why some are complaining!"
7159,2275,4," Great value- 6 year old absolutely loves them"
7160,2275,5," Arrived quicker than expected. Had a look at them and there great. It'll make a perfect little Christmas gift for my daughter who will be 3 months. Definitely recommend to a friend"
7161,2276,5," Very pleased with product very good price :-)"
7162,2277,5," My nephew loved this item. Very happy with the purchase."
7163,2277,5," Exactly as shown.  Prompt delivery.  One happy Grandson"
7164,2277,5," So cute.  Arrived fast."
7165,2277,5," Ver happy with product"
7166,2278,2," This was a much wanted christmas present for my little granddaughter& she loves it!! Good quality& very happy."
7167,2278,5," Really lovely teddy. Grancdchildren love them. Recommended."
7168,2278,5," Daughter loves this"
7169,2278,5," Brilliant"
7170,2279,1," The item on the left was delivered as a 'large' disney bullseye toy from Amazon and the item on the right is the genuine medium disney bullseye from the Disney store. The item I received was a total disgrace!!"
7171,2279,4," Bought Bullseye for my 2 year old grandaughter to go with her Jessie.  She carries them around all the time& a great success."
7172,2279,5," I have bought this fory 2 year old daughter for Christmas to go with a Jessie doll. It is great quality(Disney label)&  has Andy on his hooves and is really big. I chose it after reading the reviews and I am very pleased with it. She is going to love it. I can't wait to see her face when she opens it."
7173,2279,1," RUBBISH& bad buy I feel its a TOTAL FAKE& it came in a plastic bag and not a box as all the other Toy story characters we have bought our grandson has& definitely NOT as described as there is no A-N-D-Y embroidered on the feet& mouth is closed but in the photo the mouth is open& no folded and stitched pleats on the neck& stitch quality is terrible& the photograph they use is the same as on the Disney Store website& but this toy is totally different. KEEP WELL CLEAR. very disappointed and feel I have been cheated. Should be called BODGER not Bullseye."
7174,2279,5," Great buy& good quality and size my son loves it! Value for money would definitely recommend this product to anyone"
7175,2279,1," Received this a few days ago as part of my daughter's Christmas. It came in a plastic bag& and was not as described. It's got a Disney Parks label on it& no Disney exclusive label beside the tail and definitely no A-N-D-Y."
7176,2279,5," I bought this for my niece for her 3rd birthday and she absolutely loves it! The toy is really soft and he is an exact replica of the one from the movie (even has andy written on the bottom of his feet) Bullseye is her new favourite teddy& I would definetly recommend this if you are planning of buying a bullseye for a smaller child."
7177,2279,4," I bought this for my three year old grandson who's currently big into toy story& I thought it was a bit expensive but it is of reasonable quality and should last a while& by the the way its floppy and does not stand upright as the illustration shows."
7178,2280,5," my partner loved it&thanks for fast service"
7179,2281,5," the land rover along with others I've purchased recently are a great item as I can adapt them to different styles for the diorama I am making."
7180,2281,4," Purchased for my boyfriend who was happy with the kit."
7181,2281,5," Arrived on time and as expected. Thank  you"
7182,2282,5," Absolutely perfect!!! Love it& this was a gift for my boyfriend and I think he will really like it :D thank you!"
7183,2282,5," It's really cute ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š"
7184,2283,4," I paid 10 pounds for this for my little boy who loves frozen& the reason why I gave it 4 stars is purely because I feel it was quite expensive although seeing it at 7.99 is much more reasonable.Anna says a few different things and I would say it's a good volume& clear and mostly sounds like her!She is as stated 8 inches and although I was expecting her to be small - she really is so although a lovely doll with a quality feeling dress& with hindsight if it wasn't a last minute purchase I'd definitely have ordered a bigger one.In general a lovely little doll."
7185,2283,3," I am disappointed in this item&the speech is very low&"
7186,2283,4," Disappointed with quality but two year old was happy"
7187,2283,1," Strange looking& says random forgettable lines and my 3yo who is obsessed with Frozen does not like it. I guess this is a case of false economy.  Buy a better one if I were you...wish I did!"
7188,2283,5," My little frozen fan was super impressed to hear real phrases from the movie in a soft doll she could cuddle in bed. It's got good sound for something small and great quality."
7189,2283,3," It's okay for the money I suppose& but a bit odd looking and I can't hear a word it say's. For a doll it has the most unusual ears. :)"
7190,2283,4," Small but lovely doll!"
7191,2283,5," Great for any frozen fan. The sayings are a little random but at 1 that doesn't matter to my daughter and she loves it"
7192,2284,5," I have a few of these at the nursery I work at and they are FAB! We use them every day& and have shade then for over two years and they show no sign of damage and this children do given them a good work out! Our do sometimes get left in the rain if we are caught unaware have a few signs of rust but that's our fault!All in all FAB toy for children up to the age of about 4 old ones could use it but it's a bit of a squeeze with legs and the handle bar!"
7193,2284,5," One year old grandson loved it from the minute he saw it. Needed to be pushed along at the beginning but gradually became more confident.This product is extremely well made& sturdy& eye-catching and easy to fit into the car when off to the park!"
7194,2284,3," I have got annoyed as we had to get this replaced due to missing parts. Now it is all working it is lovely and perfect for small children. Our babies and toddlers at nursery love it."
7195,2284,5," This will last for years to come it will do all the grandkids"
7196,2285,5," His face is a bit scary"
7197,2285,4," As expected"
7198,2286,5," Brilliant price and just what I wanted."
7199,2286,5," Fabulous quality and service"
7200,2287,5," I love this - I have bought many items like this and would buy again& easy to use& stays warm& helps with aches and pains and keeps me warm"
7201,2287,3," its great apart from the lav ender smell which i didn't realise it had its in the gift cupboard. great cover"
7202,2287,5," I bought this for my mum. The size is small which is perfect for pains and aches. She used it all the time and the smell is amazing& lavender like! Price was perfect for this product& would defo recommend xx"
7203,2287,5," Wonderful item to keep for yourself or give as a gift. Only thing I have to say is stay away from the light colors as they can get dirty and they cant be washed"
7204,2287,4," My mother loves  this hot water bottle.She is registered partial sighted and was finding it very difficult to fill a hot water bottle with boiling water."
7205,2287,5," I bought this for a friend who finds it hard to relax and also suffers with back ache so thought it would be a nice gift. So cosy and soft."
7206,2287,5," the lavender aroma was perfect and didn't irritate breathing during the night - relevant to those who having breathing problems."
7207,2287,5," Quick and safe to warm up& soft and cosy in use. I love it.  Better than the one I was replacing."
7208,2288,4," this is a brilliant little messenger bag for young boys& I spent a while looking for one suitable for my 7 year old as most of the messenger bags you can buy are just too big and not really very appealing and very expensive& so I looked on Amazon and found this among others and my son loves it!!! My only criticism is that the strap I don't think is long enough& making it a little awkward which is why it lost a star for me! maybe this is because it is aimed at 3 onwards I think& but even though I am sure they could manage another couple of inches as long as it is adjustable...however it is still a great bag& a lovely design&my son loves it and the bag itself is plenty big enough for what he needs to carry with him to primary school."
7209,2288,4," This is much better than I expected for the price.  Perfect for school- plenty of space for homework and lunchbox.  Only reason I didn't give 5 starts was because there are no internal pockets.  But amazing for the price and my daughter loves it."
7210,2288,5," Got this for my son for school he loves it and its big enough for books& lovely design to and unique so no getting mixed u with any other bags and it will definatly last till school year is over and longer."
7211,2288,5," Thank you for the prompt delivery of my product my son absolutely loved his spiderman school bag and at a great price too& look forward to buying from you in the near future.  Thsnks once again."
7212,2289,5," Bought it for my niece's first b'day and she loves it. It seems well built& lovely colors and great to ride on."
7213,2290,5," We originally bought a black version of this dragon from a local store& and when my 4yo nephew came to visit he forgot all about his new cousin and just played with it.We bought him this one for his birthday last month and when we met up with him and his mum and dad yesterday at a pub 1/2 way between us he insisted we bought ours along for 'Dragon races'(He has named his Tom& we subsquently named ours Terry.)We had several admiring onlookers at the pub& some of them were allowed to look after the Tom for a while (but not a long while!)Some of the onlookers parents wanted to know where we got Tom& so we directed them to the The Puppet Company on Amazon!Hope everyone enjoys them as much as me and my nephew!P.S. Tom won the Dragon races"
7214,2290,5,""
7215,2290,5," My Grandson loved it"
7216,2291,4," This puppet reaches expectations.It is well-produced and will last for several generations. It has character and looks fierce& thus enabling it to play  a usefulpart in a puppet show."
7217,2291,5," Absolutely amazing. My children love it and it works as a great decoration when they are not playing with it."
7218,2291,5," Really pleased 1st class quality yes would deffinatly recommend this product"
7219,2291,5," As described and on time"
7220,2292,5," Family member who loves 'doing voices' entertains friends family etc by bringing this to life ðŸ˜"
7221,2293,5," This is a beautifully well-made toy that has quickly become one of the favourite children's items at the preschool where I work.The glove puppet is large enough to fit comfortably onto most adult hands& but not so large that it's too floppy for children (even as young as two) to use it. The puppet is made from a sort of soft plush velvet and includes detailing such as terrible tusks& terrible claws& terrible teeth& knobbly knees& a green (poisonous) wart on his nose& a black tongue and purple 'prickles' all made out of good quality& stiffened felt.The little finger puppet mouse which accompanies the Gruffalo is also nice& though less detailed than the glove puppet& but can prove a bit large for smaller hands to wear. Smaller fingers aren't big enough to stop the mouse's head from tipping and overbalancing the puppet.As a nice touch& the mouse Velcros on to the Gruffalo in two places - the Gruffalo's right hand& and inside his mouth. If you want to add a further dimension to re-enactments of the Gruffalo story and own a cutting food loaf& a slice of this will stick quite nicely between the Gruffalo and the mouse... allowing you to perform |you'll taste good on a slice of bread|. My preschool class find this hysterical.Such a well-loved toy& I've bought a couple more as gifts for colleagues' children.* * *One small note of caution: particularly timid youngsters might find this puppet a bit scary. Although most love the Gruffalo& the puppet's mouth does open quite wide to reveal what can seem an intimidating biting capacity."
7222,2293,5," This was ordered as a birthday present for my 2 year old who loves Gruffalo.It was a success! He loves it& even though his hand is too small to be able to make the mouth open fully& he still manages to pretend to make Gruffalo growl.The puppet is really well made& has all the details that are mentioned in the story (poisonous wart& purple prickles etc).Little Mouse finger puppet is a great addition as well.I would definitely recommend it for any Gruffalo fan!"
7223,2293,5," Great guffalo hand puppet my kids love this alots have lots of fun with this  would recommend this all kids"
7224,2293,5," Gave this to my 2 year old grandson yesterday for Christmas and he loved it.!! Well made and ideal for imaginative play.The finger puppet mouse is held in place by velcro so can be removed to act out the story. Highly recommended!! I thought at the time it was pricey for a glove puppet but it is so well made it is well worth the money."
7225,2293,5," Bought for my grandson for christmas. Cant wait to see his face!opened it to see what it was like was pleased with this puppet& soft and durable this a good buy.I know one little boy who will be exceptionally happy christmas day.Delivery very quick."
7226,2293,3," It matches perfectly with Gruffalo from the book and my son loves playing with it while I am reading him the book. The only downside is few threads have come out of place really soon so build quality is compromised I can say."
7227,2293,4," My son just loves the gruffalo books so i thought we had to get him this"
7228,2293,5," This was given as a present to my two year old grandson and he loves it.  It is well made and great fun to play with.  It also encourages reading of the gruffalo and Gruffalo's child."
7229,2294,5," As described"
7230,2295,5," These are lovely& well-made and very high quality puppets. The main body is a very thick& long-'fur' fabric (which can shed a little in its first few uses) and the feet and beak are made from brushed nylon.  What you can't see from the photo is that this 'Bird of Paradise' puppet has a softly padded chest/tummy area so is quite plump.  In use& her head appears to sit back slightly due to the padding giving her greater character and personality.This large-size (approx 40cm long excluding tail) puppet can be used by young children& teenagers or even adults. I have large hands and long arms but still find them comfortable to use. The large beak is very easy to operate and& unlike some other puppets which force the operator to move both the upper and lower beak/jaw& it is easy and comfortable to move only the lower beak. This is a much more natural and realistic movement than raising the upper beak for the bird to 'speak' or squawk. The squawker inside the mouth is surprisingly loud and makes a fairly realistic bird-squawk sound rather than a typical squeaker-squeak. It can also be removed& if preferred.I use these puppets to make entertainment videos for a mostly adult audience& including a special needs group of adults. I've found that adults with a sense of humour seem to appreciate them just as much as children of all ages from toddlers to pre-teens. They're very versatile& great fun and I think they offer exceptional value for money considering their quality. I have nearly the full range of these birds and I generally operate them in pairs with them interacting together for performances.  The puppets have different squawks so can 'communicate' together in a variety of tones and pitches!A very good buy and great fun too& limited only by your own or your child's creativity and imagination."
7231,2295,4," I am completely in love with this puppet - probably more so than my one-year old for whose first birthday we bought it! Firstly& it's worth saying that it's rather big& but that's no problem for us (my husband& having thought it was pricey when I bought it& took it back when he saw the size of it!) and it's certainly good value. It's incredibly bright and colourful and great for children. I did notice that if you pull hard at the fluff then it can come off so I wouldn't encourage smaller children biting and chewing on it but it's brilliant now for storytelling and my daughter is completely enchanted by it and beams whenever I bring it out. The 'squawker' inside the beak is also fantastic so you can pretend the puppet is talking to your child which is great for interaction. All in all& a delightful puppet from which I know we will get a lot of use and years of play."
7232,2295,5," This was the most brilliant purchase. I am going to use this puppet to tell stories to young children and the puppet looks so life like due to its size and the ability to move just the lower beak. It is very easy to move and you can make it do so many things like moving your fingers to make it look like it's breathing. It has the added benefit of a squawk which is really easy to use. I would highly recommended it."
7233,2295,5," I bought this for my daughter's first birthday and she loves it. The squeak is a nice surprise for her and she is always hugging it. It's popular with my 3 year old boy and 5 year old girl too. The grandparents say its scary looking but the kids love it and that is what counts. It's beautiful quality and when an adult uses it it really comes alive. I would recommend."
7234,2295,4," This puppet is at least a third of the price currently being charged instore. It's beautifully made and a bargain. The only downside was the length of time it took to deliver& yes you've probably all guessed by now& the couriers were Home Delivery Network Ltd. The only downside in ordering this puppet. Otherwise I recommend this toy."
7235,2295,5," my daughter saw this in a garden centre and wanted one for xmas but i didn't want to get her one that everyone had played with& so I bought one from amazon and it comes brand new in packaging& its beautifully made& she loves playing with it and the price was perfect. one very pleased daughter."
7236,2295,3," Very nice colour& however the squeaky part has moved with only a little use so that it hangs down rather than being in the correct place to squeak when you use your hand to open and close the beak - if that makes sense!"
7237,2295,1," Material is reasonable quality and seems well made but squeaker stopped working on Day 3 !!!!! Massive disappointment to child No response to email or telephone calls Lodged a complaint with Amazon cannot recommend"
7238,2296,5," This is such a beautiful toy& the picture doesn't do it justice.  It is well made and the animals look really cute.  The tree is also soft and the stitiching is good& so pretty unbreakable& with a handle that makes carrying it around easy.  My 2 year old niece loved it and immediately set about pulling all the animals out and bringing them to life.  The animals in the tree include an owl& a bird& a squirrel& a fox& a badger and a hedgehog.  The fox is slightly bigger than the other animals and is not a finger puppet.  The hedgehog is smaller and I couldn't really get my finger into it properly& however& it is fine for my niece.  I love it and wish I'd bought one for myself too!"
7239,2296,5," A truly lovely soft play item.  Lots of fun to be had hiding the various puppet toy animals in their tree& as well as playing with them individually.  Nice carry handle too.  Altogether a quality item which went down very well with our 3 year old.  I'm sure it will be played with lots. Good overall size.  Very impressed.  Excellent value."
7240,2296,5," Beautiful set. For all the reviewers who can't understand the fox puppet& you put a finger in each of the front paws. Not terribly complicated!"
7241,2296,5," this toy is really fun&it's even been used as a little bag by my little girl. She plays with the owl the most. A good choice and a great gift."
7242,2296,3," This is a lovely product& however a little more time should be spent the fine detail. i.e. the owls beak was on upside down& one of the puppets finger hole was too small& hadn't been finished.  Having said this& I must add that fortunately these snags when unnoticed by the children who loved their new found woodland friends."
7243,2296,5," Very pleased with the speed in this arriving. Will use the supplier again. Bought this for my grandaughter.  So unusual& fun and well made.The Puppet Company Hideaway Puppets (Tree House)"
7244,2296,5," I have purchased two of these Tree House puppet sets& one whilst on holiday in the Lake District and the other via Amazon. The puppets are designed for 1 year+ and the recipients are both a year old& a girl and a boy. Both seized on the toys immediately and were so interested in them it was a joy to see. The quality is superb and will give lasting enjoyment as well as being educational. Delightful."
7245,2296,5," Brought for child's woodland theme birthday party& loved it.& lots of fun for them& good quality made toy& would recommend"
7246,2297,5," I bought this for an (almost) 2-yr old& duck-obsessed boy. As with all The Puppet Company puppets that I have seen - and we have a few - it is super quality. The 'fur' is soft and silky& but can be sponged off quite happily. The beak and wings are shaped so that the operator can make nice expressions with the puppet.So for all of you out there who ARE looking for a duck puppet& I heartily recommend this one!"
7247,2297,4," Excellent value for money& very well made.  I found it difficult to move both beak and wings at the same time& felt you would do one or the other.  This company offer a very good after sales service if you have any queries.  They have a fabulous selection of puppets to choose from. Heather"
7248,2297,4," A great support for drama work with year 1 children. Have used it for the story of Pumpkin Soup and Farmer Duck. It is really soft and all the children wanted the opportunity to |have a go|. It has also been useful during assembly activities and PSHE. Excellent value and good quality."
7249,2297,4," Very cuddly. It is a shame that the beak doesn't move though."
7250,2297,5," A lovely gift& feels really soft"
7251,2298,5," Brilliant quality. Bought for my 4 year old daughter who is obsessed with zebras and it has had some considerable dragging around inside and outside but is still in superb condition. The hair on the product has not come out at all even though being roughly handled by a 4 year old. You cannot see from the product photograph but it even has a tail and a mouth that opens. Good size and beautifully lined inside. Lovely quality and highly recommended. Love it"
7252,2298,4," does exactly what it says on the tin. you can make the mouth move as well."
7253,2298,4," This is a great quality product - really well made.But I would just note that the size is big - even for adults! I bought it for my 2-year olds& who love these puppets& but they have to fit their entire arm into the puppet - which is not really what I intended....."
7254,2298,5," Loved the selection of puppets from this company - andchose the zebra for a little girl (4) who is a Madagascarfan. She uses her puppet to speak to other animal toysand act out animal stories of her own. Well made andgreat value."
7255,2299,5," Our daughter  now 5) recieved this as a christmas present last year and he was an instant hit! She loves puppets anyway and has a puppet theater with finger puppets ect& but the sheer size of this thing puts him on a different level. Shes named him after a dragon from the 70's film |the flight of dragons| and she has played with him constantly since christmas& using him in games& story telling and imaginative play. She also uses him to entertain our 9month old son who also loves him& despite the dragon being bigger than himself and her making gorebash nibble his tasty toes!! The only problem with the puppet is that the lovely gold on his horns& wings and toes is wearing off  he's obviously been chewed a bit!) but with the beatings he's taken since we got him & I'm not really suprised& he's done really well!Im now looking to purchase another puppet from this company for my son& just hope I can find something he will like!"
7256,2299,5," I bought this for our 11 year old grandson who collects dragon figures. Although it is a toy it is suitable for an older child and is gorgeous. He has not been given it yet as bought for Chrismas but know he will love it and keep his baby sister either amused or terrified!"
7257,2299,5," Highly recommend this puppet - large and with sticks to operate.  Looks good sitting in daughter's room even when not in use.  Fabulous."
7258,2299,5," We bought this puppet for use with 4 and 5 year olds& and it was a real hit! The youngsters loved it. He looks great and was easily visible amongst a group of 60+. Manipulating the mouth for |speech| is comfortable and straightforward and if you are used to hand puppets or muppets& you should find appropriate movements relatively easy to effect with this dragon."
7259,2299,5," The first thing to say is that we bought this for our daughter's 10th birthday& and she simply adores it.  But then she is dragon crazy.Morgan (as he is now known) goes everywhere with her& and that is no mean feat when you consider how big he is!  I know he is meant to be a puppet& but he also fulfills the role of large cuddly toy quite admirably.So& all in all& a big hit with junior.  Phew& at least mum and dad did something right for a change."
7260,2300,5," This is a Christmas present for our nephew who is obsessed with our black Labrador. I know that he is going to love it& very cute& lot bigger than I imagined. Very soft and plush and can't wait to see his face when he opens it. Very impressed ( and he has a very handsome face)The Puppet Company Long-Sleeved Glove Puppets Labrador (Black)"
7261,2300,5," Fabrador gift for my baby grandson... and his parents. Very soft and cute."
7262,2300,5," My granddaughter loves it."
7263,2301,5," We have bought this for my son to take to peru on a gap trekking expedition where he will be visiting a school. His college think it is a great idea and I'm sure it will be a good ice breaker. The quality is very good so I am sure it will stand the test of time."
7264,2301,4," Good clean simple fun& my baby loved this and walks about with it on his hand easy to use& the cardthat comes with it should be laminated though"
7265,2301,5," I bought this to play with with my granddaughter and am not sure whether she or I like it best.  It is great fun and makes singing the song much more fun. I had never seen it until I googled |duck puppets| and thought it a bit expensive.  I  hope to get good use out of it."
7266,2301,5," I love using these glove puppets as a teacher with the children in my class as they help to keep the children engaged throughout the song. The glove puppet is also well made and should last a long time."
7267,2301,5," Our 5 month old daughter has bought this for her daddy for Christmas.  We first saw them used at story time at our local library& all the children (under 5's) love them as a visual aid for singinging!!"
7268,2301,5," What a super idea to accompany the hand puppet with a copy of the rhyme!  The little ducks are charming and their dangling little feet result in great joy as they move!"
7269,2301,5," Excellent quality and fast delivery. Brightly coloured and eye catching& complete with lyrics for those who are not familiar with the songs. My daughter loves them!"
7270,2301,5," Great! What can I say? Does what it says on the tin.... Children really love it& you can get them to help count how many left after eac verse. Durable"
7271,2302,5," I needed a duck puppet for my story sack. It is just the correct size for small hands to manage . It's cute  yellow and with bright eyes and brings a smile to my face every time I look at it.The material is soft and does not frei"
7272,2302,5," this is a perfect hand puppet.  my 18 month old granddaughter loves it.  she identifies it with the nursery rhymes&  especially 5 little ducks."
7273,2302,4," Child likes the mum and baby& has fun with them. Quality fine for the price."
7274,2302,1," It doesn't look like duck. Its unidentficable thing. Not happy"
7275,2302,5," Love this me and my daughter get loads of fun together out of it"
7276,2302,5," Gift for grandaughter lots of fun kind regards carol"
7277,2302,5," Excellent! My granddaughters love them very much."
7278,2303,4," I've been very impressed with the quality of this range of puppets - which is not conveyed by the photos. They are very well made from a very thick and high quality plush fabric and are surprisingly life-like.Although targetted at children they can also be used by adults - my hand is 19cm long and I can use it comfortably with fingers inserted into the front paws and another two to operate the mouth. The mouth is quite small so if you're looking for a puppet to 'speak' then it would be better to seek one with a larger mouth such as Large Rabbit Tellatale Puppet but this range by The Puppet Company will not disappoint an adult or child looking to have a bit of fun!This puppet comes in two versions - a standard glove puppet and this long-sleeve version which I feel is better suited to adults or for using in a puppet-theatre type setting."
7279,2303,5," A Wonderful puppet that would make a great toy and an excellent teaching aid.  Lovely quality and detail&  well made& durable and excellent value for money.  Very pleased with my purchase."
7280,2303,4," great product very good quality and quick delivery. I bought these for my son& something to do with his drama class. They are good quality and value for money"
7281,2303,5," lovely quality"
7282,2304,5," My grandson loved it"
7283,2305,5," Love this snake& we use it when we're reading the Gruffalo! Only criticism I wish it's tongue were pink or red as it does not stand out very much against the black mouth"
7284,2305,3," I bought this for doing children's talks and it looks good. There is room for fingers to work the mouth"
7285,2305,5," This was bought as a gift& and my grandson loved it& very well made. He had fun playing with it."
7286,2305,5," excellent service& puppet as expected& great quality."
7287,2305,5," Gorgeous puppet! Much bigger than I expected!"
7288,2306,5," Love it :-)"
7289,2307,5," Preparing your child for surgery is not easy. Through the use of puppet play& this great doctor puppet can be used to introduce your child to the upcoming experience of a hospital theatre where staff are gowned and masked which can be frightening for youngsters if not pre-warned. This jolly puppet is easy to operate and we have had a great response on hospital visits to children's wards. We have added him to our cast of Gastronaut puppets - can be seen on utube or on thebowelmovement& and intend to use him as part of the cast for a series of plays for children with ostomies. We have also discussed the use of puppet play to explain chronic ullness  in the book unwanted baggage also on Amazon. (children's section) Melissa"
7290,2307,5," Was very pleased with the quality of this toy& which I purchased together with Smoulder the Dragon puppet& for my friends boys who are 5 and 3. The puppets were bigger than I had thought they would be and the addition of the stick makes controlling them much easier for children.  Would definitely recommend to any budding puppeteers!"
7291,2307,5," excellent made product& find it good for the children's creative development& have and will buy more of these puppets"
7292,2308,5," I won't waffle on too much& as this is very much a WYSIWYG item& except to say that this puppet& along with its cousins& has a loud squawk when you move the beak& which gives it oodles more character than a silent puppet.  My son (now 11) has had it for 9 months now and whilst the novelty factor wore off after a while& 'Beaky' comes out now and again& with little sign of wear or tear at all.  Great fun& and recommended for children anywhere between 5 and 11."
7293,2308,5," This is a brilliant puppet& which my 6 year old was introduced to at school& as her teacher uses it in class.  My daughter begged for one for her birthday and Touey has now found her way into our house.  It's beautifully made and easy for her to control.  We liked it so much we've now bought the green parrot to go with it.  Highly recommended."
7294,2308,5," These are lovely& well-made and very high quality puppets.  The main body is a very thick& long-'fur' fabric (which can shed a little in its first few uses) and the feet and beak are made from brushed nylon.This large-size (approx 40cm long excluding tail) puppet can be used by young children& teenagers or even adults and a 'baby bird' version is available purely for children.  I have large hands and long arms but still find them comfortable to use.  The large beak is very easy to operate and& unlike some other puppets which force the operator to move both the upper and lower beak/jaw& it is easy and comfortable to move only the lower beak.  This is a much more natural and realistic movement than raising the upper beak for the bird to 'speak' or squawk.  The squawker inside the mouth is surprisingly loud and makes a fairly realistic bird-squawk sound rather than a typical squeaker-squeak.  It can also be removed& if preferred.I use these puppets to make entertainment videos for a mostly adult audience& including a special needs group of adults.  I've found that adults with a sense of humour seem to appreciate them just as much as children of all ages from toddlers to pre-teens.  They're very versatile& great fun and I think they offer exceptional value for money considering their quality.  I have nearly the full range of these birds and I generally operate them in pairs with them interacting together for performances.A very good buy and great fun too& limited only by your own or your child's creativity and imagination."
7295,2308,5," As a chidrens entertainer this bird fits the bill(excuse the pun) also suitable for adult shows.Easy to handle &washable .Good value for money.Deliverey spot on."
7296,2308,5," Lovely cuddly puppet& well made& reasonable priced.  Recommended for all sorts of interactive play and learning.  Good size for both adult and child sized hands.  Very fast delivery."
7297,2308,4," Good size of bird& bought for a laugh for my twin brother as a birthday present (19 year old) and we've been using it daily as it provides so much fun!Dog isn't a fan of it so if a small kid is using it maybe keep away from pets.As much as I love it I wouldn't buy it again as Â£17.50 is way too much - it literally is a puppet that squeaks.It also casts quite a bit the first few uses but then it is fine - no bald bits due to casting either which is handy."
7298,2308,5," Fabulous puppet& we had hours of fun with this (and thats just the adults) kids think its great and it actually withstands kids playing with it all the time!"
7299,2308,4," I bought this for my 18 month daughter after seeing one at the local garden centre ( at nearly double the price!) I know she is below the recommended age but we have had hours of fun with this toy& singing nursery rhymes and chasing her around the kitchen! The only downside is the bird malts leaving bits of black hair everywhere! Overall great button!"
7300,2309,5," This product is both fun and practical& we got it for our daughter for her 1st birthday and she absolutley adores it.  Her big sister chose it for her and now she wants the yellow dog version for herself.  We have all had so much fun with the elephant puppet and the blanket is so soft and snuggly."
7301,2309,5," I have purchased the snuggle pet elephant for my 2 year old little girl for christmas after seeing the advert on the tv she wanted it so badly! He has arrived this morning and I have had a peek in the box to inspect him and he is gorgeous. He is a lovely blue colour and has very soft material& very pleased with the quality and size of this product and know my daughter is going to absolutely adore him."
7302,2309,4," Bought this for my 8 year old that loves everything about elephants& it is more a samll blanket with feet and a head& she loves it though& in fact have had to buy a second one to enable washing"
7303,2309,5," I bought one each for my two children& they both love them and have them with them all the time."
7304,2309,4," Good& quick delivery. Nephew really pleased with product. I thought product material felt a little poor and few loose threads that had to be stitched in and cut off. But as long as he is happy."
7305,2309,5," Daughter loves it always takes it to bed and if she could would take it wherever she may be going good purchase"
7306,2309,1," This was bought at the request of my daughter but the quality of the product was extremely poor. The edge of one of the ears had been sewn up (looked post production) and the stitching was coming loose elsewhere. The only reason why I haven't sent it back is because I don't have the time."
7307,2309,3," Looks as in the picture& but the stitching is quite poor. My 3yr old had been playing with it for about half an hour before the head started to come away from the blanket! It's okay but I wouldn't recommend it."
7308,2310,5," At Â£15 I initially thought this was quite pricey as I had to buy the book separately but upon use& it's definitely worth the money and is well made& with storage on the gingerbread mans back for the small puppets. It helps little ones engage with the story and stops my daughter turning the pages before we've finished reading. I definitely want to buy more from the collection and recommend this product."
7309,2310,4," This is a really sweet product - we gave them as gifts to the children at our wedding& and they loved them. The finger puppets are adorable.  The colour of the gingerbread man is slightly odd though - if this was a biscuit& I fear it would be rather burnt! Possibly not the cheapest toy out there either& but still a very sweet set."
7310,2310,5," was amazed at the quality of this item-as a gift for my great granddaughter did not unpack until wrapping Christmas presents. Very impressed.-made one little girl very happy"
7311,2310,5," Just brought these for my son for Christmas.  Can't wait to put on a little puppet show for him. They are lovely!"
7312,2310,5," Attractive plush puppet. Loved by our 3 year old granddaughter."
7313,2311,4," Very easy to make even for my 3 and a half years old niece. Down side is the glue which doesn't work well with the felt fabric"
7314,2312,5," This Crocodile needs taming it wasn't long out its packaging when it was chasing small children around the house& connected to Grandad of course.  This is a well made puppet that I am sure will be chasing Grandchildren for many years to come. It is also good value& I have seen it in the shops since buying it and it was much more expensive."
7315,2312,5," Bought this to terrorize my 18 Month old daughter& and it's absolutely fantastic - really well made& and it looks terrific. As much as she hoots with laughter and fear when it cames after her& that doesn't stop her from picking it up at the end of playtime& handing it to me and demanding |Snap-snap!|. A great puppet - well made& well designed and really excellent value."
7316,2312,5," Safe fun toy. Loads of laughs with grand kids. Think Emu puppet on Parkinson Show! Just so funny.Soft crocodile mouth and teeth look good - so harmless fun. A good sense of humour developed young is a great asset.It undoes the absurdity of serious life - just when you could be sucked down by life issues. - And no one is immune!Being able to have a good laugh - to share comedic moments - laughs the blues and stresses away.Thank you Puppet Company.  Will be making another purchase again this year. But Shhh  ... its a surprise!Bless You."
7317,2312,5," My 13 month old daughter LOVES her croc. We got him and a monkey to use when we sing nursery rhymes like we do at the library. Well made and realistic looking this is worth every penny."
7318,2312,5," Everything I expected.  It's perfect&  and a really good choice as the crocodile mouth opens and closes really easily for both adult and child hands."
7319,2312,5," This croc comes out of the box snapping ! He needs a good run around& preferably chasing small children after his journey from Amazon.A great success& caused much delighted screaming and belly laughing!"
7320,2312,5," Our 4 year old and  2 year old love the puppet. They have named it Christopher.Many thanks to your compny."
7321,2312,4," Bought these as one of three Puppet Company puppets for my daughter's first birthday. She was thrilled when we got them out of the package and started playing with them straight away. I'm a particular fan of the crocodile as we have several stories and songs containing references to crocodiles so can use this as a prop!"
7322,2313,5," My three year old was bought this for her birthday. We spent a good couple of hours making the puppets up and for once was good to have a kit where the adhesive (like double sided tape) actually worked. All the pieces were pre cut and of good quality. We had enough pieces left to make an extra puppet too. Nearly 6 months on my daughter still plays with her sock puppets and the pieces have all stayed stuck on. Would definitely buy again in the future for another go. Great for winter or rainy days."
7323,2313,4," Good fun& liked the fact that everything was cut and ready to go. The inserts for the mouth of the puppets make them easier for little hands to operate.  Educationally it depends what YOU put in to it..... I got the children  to think about what sort of character they were going to make and choose the  appropriate hair and features for that character.  Talked about colours and contrasting colours for effects to make their character look zany etc.  We made up a little play after the puppets were made.  Kids really had great time.Good buy."
7324,2313,5," I gave this as a gift for a four year old girl and she is very thrilled with it. She and her mum found it has given them ideas for more sock puppets with other old socks too."
7325,2313,4," I bought this for a 3 y/o& but I had to take time to sew woollen 'bobbles' on and do quite a lot of sorting of random small bits of felt into possible body parts etc.& it would have been hopeless trying to help her put the puppets together without giving her a head start& she'd have lost interest& would have been too time consuming and finicky.  Once I'd done that and then helped her finish them properly we had a lot of fun with them."
7326,2313,4," Great. Easy to use& colourful& lots of accessorising parts and no need for any other equipment. We made our puppets on the train with minimal bother."
7327,2314,5," Well made and great fun with access to operate mouth or arms.My baby's favourite DVD is oxbridge baby my first DVD where the bear is featured and is his favouriteSo he was delighted to meet bear in the flesh!"
7328,2314,5," Great bear for the boys."
7329,2315,5," Fantastic puppet& She works by inserting your hand through a hole in her head. You can work the mouth& tongue and arms. She's well made a full of character. She is quite expensive to buy when you can find other puppet cheaper& but i have few cheaper puppets and would choose this one every time. My son can operate her and he loves her so much she comes everywhere with us. The purpose of the puppet for us was to encourage speech from a child who was referred to as a |selective mute| by a psychologist. The puppets have made him feel less frightened to talk& and he will answer questions when delivered by the puppet.To summarise we have bought 4 of these style puppets and they have been an amazing aid to supporting speech from my son. You won't be disappointed with this puppet. It worth the extra money to get a quality easy to work puppet. We are loving the new family of puppets each with their own personality bursting to get out of the packaging they come in. Thanks."
7330,2316,5," When I was young& Wrinkles puppets were all the rage. They were awesome. They were also expensive and have since been discontinued. I never had one and the mental scars are still raw. That was then& this is now - I'm an adult and can buy myself what I darn well want! And this is undeniably a great thing to buy. It may not look quite as impressive as your old Wrinkles at first glance& but it totally is. Oh& and by the way& you may be interested to know that your young uns will totally love this puppet and be enchanted by it too. Maybe even more than us adults. Maybe...According to the tag& it's for ages 12 months and over. That sucks for 11-month-olds& but in fairness I think younger ages will be happy to watch adults play with it in front of them. Frankly& when I'm around they'll have to be. It's mine. But if they really& really want it and cry until you relent& because babies know how to play you and grind you down& you should bear in mind that it comes with plastic eyes.Plastic eyes could be construed as a slightly silly thing to put on what will inevitably become your carefree infant's new best friend but they look great& as does everything else about it. The image on this page doesn't do the real thing justice& it's a beautifully made representation of the Border Collie& of generous size& very comfy and equally durable and it makes the world feel like a better place.These are so fantastic that you'll probably want a second one so you can wear them like gloves. Better still& get the yellow Labrador& which also doubles up as a Golden Retriever& to be your Border Collie's partner in playtime.(PS. My reasoning for giving this five stars for educational value is still very much a work in progress& but could you really begrudge it a clean sweep?)"
7331,2316,5," This is an adorable puppet& with lovely soft fur. Perfect for anyone with a collie dog. Might be difficult for very young children to use as it is quite large& you need quite a big hand span to reach both paws properly. But it's well-made and great fun!"
7332,2316,5," Recently bought this long sleeve (It reaches an adults elbow) puppet as a small present for my 2 nieces...when it arrived& I thought it was so good& I've just ordered another one so they can have one each.If you love Border Collies& I would highly recommend this item. It even has a little tail that wags. They are very soft to touch. Appear to be well made and therefore& good value for money. I even think my own& real Border Collie will be jealous!!!I can't really rate it's educational value and durablility yet so went for middle of the road!"
7333,2316,4," Just recently bought this puppet and have to say I am totally impressed with the quality of the whole thing. The body is thickly lined and even though I have a problem getting my whole (large) hand comfortably into possition I can still manage to manouvere the arms easily enough. From this experience I will be looking at other Puppet Company hand puppets in the future to make reading time fun and enjoyable for my little one. I will say this as a negative though and thats the face of the dog looks kind of angry though its such a tiny bad point I dont really mind."
7334,2316,5," My 1 year old son loves dogs so we bought this for him for his birthday as we can't have a dog in our rented house.  He absolutely loves him!  He squeals with delight every time |Doggy| helps read a story or plays |peekaboo| with him or eats one of his toys - anything that involves the puppet& he loves.  He has now taken to insisting that Doggy goes to nursery with him and he is far and away his favourite toy.I cannot recommend this puppet enough& although it probably helps to have large hands.  Mine are quite small so I have to readjust every so often to make the mouth work properly but that's not even a fault and it doesn't detract from the enjoyment we get.  I will absolutely definitely be buying the elephant& the cat and probably another one or two as the years go by.  I may even have to buy another Doggy as cover in case the unthinkable happens and we lose him!If you're considering a puppet then I simply can't see how these ones can be beaten."
7335,2316,5," Having already bought the fox and wolf versions of this puppet I can thoroughly recommend this one as well. The quality of these puppets is superb& well made and nicely designed. Definately more comfortable as an adult& I am not sure many kids could handle the paws as easily with shorter fingers. The mouth is moveable too but isn't the easiest thing to master& my partner is far better at that than me.In short if you want a fun& cuddly pooch around the place but don't want the food bills or pet hairs then get this puppet... you will love him as much as you love your own right hand."
7336,2316,1," I don't understand the positive reviews that I have read about this puppet - it looks lovely& but you only have to touch it and the hair comes off all over our hand& clothes& carpet - you name it& the fur sticks to it. It reminds me of those really cheap soft toys you can buy that do the same thing. Even a few days after I returned the product I was still finding the hair on things& and I only had it out for 5 minutes! Totally unsuitable for smaller children. In addition& one of the plastic eyes had a sharp scratch in it."
7337,2317,4," I love the Puppet Company puppets. They are well made and good fun for behind the sofa puppet shows for all ages!The seal is a bit different than the one pictured. He has flippers instead of paws and is not as cute as the one pictured. He looks like he has taken a punch to the nose! But he is still soft&cuddly and well loved by my 4 year old!"
7338,2317,4," This toy is so cute on a picture& when it arrives it is just so-so. Anyway kids love it"
7339,2317,5," I bought this puppet to share with my Year 1 class as we are called Seals - I'm sure it will be a huge hit as it has a really cute face. I intend to let the children take him home each weekend and he certainly looks strong enough to withstand being played with regularly. A great buy!"
7340,2317,5," I bought this puppet and the seal finger puppet to use in circle time in school.  The puppets from the Puppet Company are always very good quality and always live up to expectation."
7341,2317,5," Great puppet& supper soft...."
7342,2318,4," i have another of these otter puppets by the same company&but the one i was sent seems slightly smaller& but is just as nice a quality"
7343,2319,4," I have been searching for a long time for a fabric & spider hand puppet& this was the only one that met the criteria that I have been searching for. The puppet is well made& colourful and friendly"
7344,2319,4," My daughter"
7345,2319,5," This glove puppet is great. I teach a pre school class and the children absolutely loveit. It is quite soft so not scarylooking for little ones. Arrived quickly too! Very happy."
7346,2320,5," This puppet is also lovely& and my 2 year old loves it ever so much. I thought he might be a bit young& but he is really getting the hang of using his hands to make the flutterby fly :)"
7347,2320,5," I used this puppet to compliment a story I was reading to my class of 4-5 year olds (What The Ladybird Heard) and they LOVED it. They were mesmerised! It's a lovely puppet."
7348,2321,5," Although there are cheaper kits out there I would recommend this one and would be likely to buy this kit again. There are LOADS of stickers allowing more oppourtunity for creativity and for each child to create a very individual looking creature - if you gave different children the same paper bag animal to make they would look different. I like the fact that each unassembled puppet is in its own plastic resealable wrapper - easy to put unused kits aside for another day and know that you have all the pieces"
7349,2321,5," This is the most perfect craft project.  Each puppet comes individually wrapped with all the stickers& bags and card pieces required to make a single puppet.  The puppet is simple to put together& the glue holds very well and there are plenty of stickers to keep little fingers happy.  The end results are very impressive - even if you don't quite follow the straightforward instructions.  Each puppet takes about 10 minutes to make& so there is no time to get bored or frustrated.  The puppets have since been put to good use in 'puppet shows'! Truly excellent."
7350,2321,5," My 5 year old son loved this.  The puppets are easy to make and come with everything you need.  My son was able to do this activity with minimal help as the instructions are in picture form suitable for the child to follow themselves.The puppets are good quality so can be played with after they are made - and there are 4 of them in the box."
7351,2321,5," My 3 yr old nephew is very hyperactive child but it was a joy to his parents when he finally sat down to do this craft  - it kept him quiet on a rainy day.  The puppets are easy to do for a child and the pieces stick well together but he needed some help as regards to the instructions - the instructions and pictures are very clear for a child but my nephew only speaks welsh at the moment but when he grows older he will understand it.  The crafts are colourful and the end result is brilliant because he uses his imagination when it comes to playing with the puppets.  Brilliant service and would buy again."
7352,2321,5," We bought this for our 3 year old twin Grandaughters to make with Nan and Grandad.The instructions were completely idiot proof.They did need help as they were inclined to not use enough glue. We found glueing the bag rather than the cardboard pieces made it more secure and the pink glue which disappeared when dry was great for seeing whether enough glue was on. Would definitely recommend."
7353,2321,5," My children got it as advent gift. It is really easy and funny. It gives succes experience to a child.The bags is of thick quality& which allows to work without destroing it."
7354,2321,5," Pretended he was Mr Maker on the television and had great time telling his sister how to make these amazing puppets. Calm and not too excitable play.  Everybody happy."
7355,2321,5," remember imagination it was what we used before battery's. it is a pleasure to see the little tykes using theirs"
7356,2322,4," My baby adores this puppet which is bright and cheerful.  We have had lots of fun playing with him.  The fur however does shed easily so it's very much a supervised toy"
7357,2322,4," The bright colours and big features are great for my baby boy to look at I bought it for Christmas when he is a little older but have had it out a few times!"
7358,2322,5," I have been attacked by this puppet many times since buying it for my son lol& his more than happy with it."
7359,2322,5," My Little boy completely loved this puppet and has played with it loads"
7360,2322,5," Awesome"
7361,2323,5," I've been very impressed with the quality of this range of puppets - which is not conveyed by the photos. They are very well made from a very thick and high quality plush fabric and are surprisingly life-like with good features.Although targetted at children they can also be used by adults - my hand is 19cm long and I can use it comfortably with a thumb and finger fingers inserted into the paws and two fingers operating the mouth.This range by The Puppet Company will not disappoint an adult or child looking to have a bit of fun!"
7362,2323,5," This glove puppet now rejoices in the name of Rosie and has joined his nearly identical twin Smudge (obtained several years ago from Germany) to help the North Herts branch of Cats Protection when we do street collections - these glove puppets are marvellous for establishing eye contact& and once that's happened& it's much harder for punters to walk past without putting something in our tin!  And even people who don't give us money walk on with a smile& and that's not a bad thing either.  Well done& Rosie!"
7363,2323,5," the puppet was purchased for my grandson aged 1 yr. He enjoys adults using the puppet etc. It represnted value for money and  was well made"
7364,2323,5," This is one of four puppets I have purchased from The Puppet Company.  As with the others& I have nothing but good things to say about it.  Excellent quality& attention to detail etc& etc.  I am a big cat lover and one of my moggies is a tuxedo cat& just like this puppet.  All my cats were rather intrigued by it to say the least!My 2 year old niece adores the puppet (she's also a cat lover) and delights in interacting with it when she comes round.  I find puppets are a great way of teaching and engaging with young children.  Who wants to talk to a boring old grown up when you can have a cosy chat with Abercrombie the cat?"
7365,2323,4," I love this puppet and both my kids love it. My 4 year old talks to |Mr Cat| all day& and my 1 year hugs the cat.The fur is lovely and doesn't pull off (cause the boys pull on the cat). The puppet makers added little details that make the cat more life like& like a little knock in one of the ears and lovely soft nose.Best of all it gets the kids away from the tv and other devices and uses their imagination. Great for all kids of any age!My only problem is I wouldn't say you could get your hand in to move the mouth& but I do have large hands. :)"
7366,2323,4," BOUGHT AS A GIFT FOR IMAGINATIVE 6 YEAR OLD& AND HAS BEEN THE FOCUS OF MANY A PLAY/GAME . LOVELY QUALITY& WELL MADE& MAY BE A BIT TO BIG FOR VERY SMALL HANDS."
7367,2323,5," This toy is of great quality for the price. The eyes were hidden a little more than I would have liked but after messing with it a bit they became visable."
7368,2323,4," A wonderful little toy that will amuse& delight and deceive your little beloved into thinking |the cat in mummy's arms is sleeping& so I must be good& quiet& eat my lunch and then I may get to stroke it!!|Only works around two times though... :o("
7369,2324,4," My Daughter has had one of this since birth and has got very loved/worn& it was great to find that it is still avaliable!"
7370,2325,5," What do you buy a kid who has everything?My 5 year old nephew loves this.He has every 'popular' toy and I wanted something which hopefully will last him many years and wont break.It comes with a removable pole which I took out before giving him (why encourage him to hit his sister....!)I am probably going to buy more of these& as they have a knight& princess etc as well.The dragon is very well made& and I am very pleased."
7371,2325,5," Have ordered 5 Melissa"
7372,2325,5," This dragon is so much fun during story time and the children love playing with it. It has a stick to move one of its hands but this can easily be removed& it is comfortable when putting your hand in the puppet and it is easy to manipulate. It is well made and has taken quite a lot of playing with form the children in my class& but they all love it's happy friendly face."
7373,2325,5," I bought this for my daughter who is a teacher& it's a nice size for a class room teaching aid& it has a removable wooden rod to operate one of the arms. Very Well made& Good value for The Money.I would recommend for either a child (or adult's tool)."
7374,2325,5," My 9 year old son loves playing with this toy. He makes up plays with his siblings!Very good quality. Very good price. Fast delivery."
7375,2325,5," Thank you Melissa and Doug for a truly excellent puppet.  I love the detail of the puppet and he has won over many children's heart's in the classroom.Speedy delivery.  Would recommend to a friend."
7376,2325,5," I can only give this product 5 stars as the quality of the puppet is excellent and the delivery was nice and fast.Great product would recommend to any one."
7377,2325,5," Lovely puppet& has become a firm favourite already and only given in September as part of birthday present. Would recommend"
7378,2326,5," A delightful Red Dragon glove puppet. It has been well designed and is easy to use. My children have had hours of creative fun and I get to have a go at bedtime with tell a tale !Well worth the money."
7379,2326,5," I had my eye on this since first discovering my best friend was expecting! In my experience hand puppets are perfect for kids (and parents!) of all ages and are cherished toys& not ones that are cast aside and thrown out when the little darlings get bored of it. My next purchase will be the Monkey Hand Puppet."
7380,2326,5," Lovely& really good quality puppet. My 6 year old daughter got off or Christmas and was so pleased with it. It's well made and lovely quality. Lots of fun to be had!"
7381,2326,5," bought this for my grandson as he has an extremely active imagination& he has put on numerous 'shows' great fun for all of us. He loves his puppets."
7382,2326,3," great the puppet arrived well within the given arrival date and was in excellent contition. The children loved it they had hours of fun!"
7383,2326,4," Bought this for my grand-daughter and she loves it.  She recently moved to Wales and is proud of her Welsh dragon puppet!"
7384,2327,5," I bought one of these as a present for my niece and loved it so much that my husband bought one for me too! This is a lovely product - really well made with loads of details in the features and the clothes. It's easy to use and my own 2 1/2 year old loves playing with it with me (he actually pays attention when the puppet asks him to brush his teeth) I'm really pleased with this product and will definately be buying some of the other ones."
7385,2327,5," Beautifully made and perfect size - nice and large& great for adult hands.  And very good value.  My children love this puppet and all the others I have in this range. (In a perfect world& I think I would prefer these puppets to have round& rather than flat heads& and I'd prefer to be able to manipulate the mouth& as one can with most or all of the Puppet Company's animal puppets"
7386,2327,5," great product and beautiful details. well made and arrived on time"
7387,2327,5," Very beautiful and well made"
7388,2328,4," I bought this for my 2 year old niece. She's a bit scared of it& but her Mum loves it and has had many hours of fun playing with it! Lots of different possibilities for sticking the bits everywhere and it's good to teach kids about the parts of the body& even though they're not your normal looking eyes and noses etc!"
7389,2328,4," This is a great item we have though rely enjoyed playing with it but I have found that the hair off the parts ie arms eyes etc stick over the Velcro so you are forever pulling it back out! Annoying& but i found that if you trim the hair around the Velcro it doesn't stick as much. Apart from that this is a very fun& good prices item definitely worth the money"
7390,2328,5," Brilliant. Granddaughter (4) immediately captivated& although very upset when a sucker fell off a 'foot' after she stuck it to a door. Older siblings also wanted to grab it and play too which caused a bit of an upset!"
7391,2329,5," I wanted the puppet to tell the story of Jesus riding into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday from his point of view to several lots of children! He did the job brilliantly!"
7392,2329,4," Well made. Ears could have been longer to emphasise was a donkey not a horse."
7393,2329,5," Arrived quickly and my daughter loves it"
7394,2330,5," Beautifully made and perfect size - nice and large& great for adult hands.  And very good value.  My children love this puppet and all the others I have in this range. (In a perfect world& I think I would prefer these puppets to have round& rather than flat heads& and I'd prefer to be able to manipulate the mouth& as one can with most or all of the Puppet Company's animal puppets"
7395,2331,5," All the puppets in this range including this one are great. One of my children is selectively mute and these puppets have been so useful with helping her to talk in anxiety provoking situations& school etc... They are the best quality puppets we have used& good detail on them& good quality material and durable. Fantastic."
7396,2331,5," Bought for my grandaughter to go with a puppet theatre we bought her for christmas. She absolutely loves this puppet& it's well made and easy to use. I would recommend this item for any child ."
7397,2331,5," My son loves it"
7398,2332,5," I bought this for my 19 month old nephew. He thinks it (Ooh-Ooh as he calls him) and the banana are real! He was really tentative when I first introduced him to it but now he loves it and gives it hugs all the time.It's really fun to use and is very expressive. It does shed the fur a little bit but only a very small amount. I can see this giving my nephew years of fun and a friend for the next 7 or 8 years hopefully!"
7399,2332,5," I BOUGHT THIS PUPPET AND THE BIRD ONE BY THE PUPPET COMPANY AS A GOOD INTERACTION TOY WITH MY FIRST TO BE CHILD. I WAS SUPRISED HOW BIG AND SOFT THESE PUPPETS ARE FOR THE PRICE& COMPARED TO OTHER PUPPETS THAT CAN BE TINY SO THEY CAN DOUBLE UP AS A CUDDLY TOY ALSO. MY ONLY SLIGHT COMPLAINT IS THE FUR FEELS A BIT ON THE THIN SIDE BUT OTHER THAN THAT EVERYTHING ELSE IS FINE AND I WILL BE BUYING MORE OF THESE PUPPETS IN THE FUTURE!"
7400,2332,5," Amazon wouldn't expedite my order to ROI& but I contacted the vendor directly and they sorted it out so processing through this site should work now. I received my order in 2 days& and the product is as lovely as it looks in the photo. Their 6 year-old owner loves them and they also fit a ladies' hand. Lots of cuddly& role-playing fun with these cute puppets!"
7401,2332,5," Bought this as a gift for my son.... this toy was welcomed with open arms& named Derek and became a member of the family. He's fanastically realistic& and has attended school with my son to the delight of his classmates.He's a great toy& good quality (he's now several months old) and he is standing the test of time with little loss of hair dispite the rough treatment from a seven year old. His face contorts well through the puppet handling& always bringing a laugh. My son has become quite interested in the rain forests through finding out a bit more about Derek.. so there is an educational value too..Great buy - will bring delight to any child (or adult!)."
7402,2332,5," The kids in reception just love this toy. It is great as it engages the children and are fascinated by it talking to me. They sit in silence and love to see 'Colin' as he has been named. Of course being a shy Orang he only comes out when the children are quiet. The quality is excellent as are all Puppet Company puppets. The one thing to remember is that your hand and arm will become very warm quite quickly if using for even a short time - but even so a small price to pay for engaging younger children."
7403,2332,5," Arrived on time and fulfilled my expectations. The mouth was a little difficult to manipulate& depending on the age of child for which it is intended& but my autistic grandson found no such difficulties and it goes everywhere with him."
7404,2332,5," SOFT CUDDLY AND VERY POPULAR WITH THE CHILDREN THE ONLY SLIGHT DRAWBACK IS THAT CONTROLLING THE MOUTH WITH AN ADULT HAND CAN BE A BIT DIFFICULT.OTHER THAN THAT I'M REALLY PLEASED WITH THE QUALITY."
7405,2332,5," This puppet is amazing& such good quality and large! Looking forward to using this with my Reception class in September."
7406,2333,4," Can't really comment on the educational value or the durability of this toy but it's pink and fluffy and both my girls (9 months and 3 years) love it! They love it when I do puppet show with it."
7407,2333,5," The puppet came quickly and it surprised me how big it was. It's great fun and easy to use. Amazing quality and I can't wait to play with my baby daughter with it."
7408,2333,5," I bought it for my 6 month old daughter and at first sight for him she  began to laugh. She liked it! Soon I will buy one more. recommended!!!"
7409,2333,5," I bought this puppet as a Christmas present for my 4 yr old and 16month old. It is without question& the favourite thing received.  The monster is now a new best friend& she even has to have a special bed made to sleep in at night!  It is so well made& very durable& and gives so many opportunities for play. A great buy& and I think unlike some other toys& will be a favourite for many years to come."
7410,2333,5," Excellent puppet& exactly as described. The sound is made by a little bag in the mouth part but can be moved out of way so doesn't always squeak. My 4 year daughter loves this and has called her Flower!"
7411,2333,5," My son absolutely loves it! A 10 yr olds Christmas present& that doesn't leave his side. Its well made& colourful and the squeaker isn't too annoying :) Think he'll be wanting the others now too!"
7412,2334,5," These were better than expected and they brought great delight to the children. Easy to use as puppets& Suitable also as soft toys. Attractive for children aged 2 to 6."
7413,2335,3," The puppet is good& but the box really lets it down. Its cardboard and the lid doesn't close& and with the advertising on the box it looks cheap."
7414,2335,4," Great little puppet& would like to have seen a sturdier box though as it can be  used to work the puppet from and gets a fair bit of wear"
7415,2335,5," 4 year old loves him"
7416,2336,4," Package arrived quickly and was in good condition.  My grandson loved it!  It is really only intended for children to use& so quite difficult for an adult to put their hand in and make it work."
7417,2336,5," 8 Year old grandson loved it.  Good quality."
7418,2336,5," My grandson loves this well made puppet!"
7419,2337,3," I bought this for a baby& he loves it but one eye fell out the first time it popped out of the honey pot.  The other eye seems secure but I wouldn't trust leaving him to playwith it in case the other eye fell out and he tried to eat it."
7420,2337,5," One of a selection of puppets that I've bought from the puppet company.  Really nice quality.  It took me a while to discover the little bee finger puppet - by which time he was looking a little bit worse for wear& but to be fair& I think that was probably my fault!  Cute toy& beautiful quality.  You might need quite small hands for these& though."
7421,2338,5," Delivered when stated..The toy is delightfully disgusting my son loves it.."
7422,2338,5," Exactly what I wanted/expected my little boy loves it"
7423,2339,5," Such a great puppet! Gift was well received. However the packaging was far too HUGE for the item. it could of been a lot smaller."
7424,2339,4," 4 year old grandson enjoyed the teeth especially and it was food that we had bought 2 puppets to make a little show"
7425,2339,5," Bought this for my grandson.  I confess I love playing with it as it's completely daft.  A great toy! recommended"
7426,2339,5," Great puppet to use when reading anyone of the dinosaur stories there are out there at the moment"
7427,2339,5," Girlfriends daughter loved it& had some fun and yet strange conversations."
7428,2340,5," I didn't expect this to be so cute........it's so lovely to see the effect of three mice jiggling in the box when we sing songs with our granddaughters. Not at all difficult to use& and with a but of practice you can get some realistic movements to show off to your audience! The girls are aged 2 and 3& and are entranced when they see it. Must see if I can get some more of this company's puppets for next Chrustmas and Birthdays."
7429,2340,5," I bought this when on holiday in Canada. They are so adorable. Folkmanis have really great puppets."
7430,2340,5," Children adore it and it is very useful for rhyming and story activities. Wonderful quality and a great addition to our storytelling box"
7431,2340,5," These mice are marvellous.My 34 year old friends loves her mice! They are a joy. I recommend these mice."
7432,2340,5," A+ speedy delivery. Wonderful puppet& as are all 'Folkmanis' items. Better than described. Very pleased."
7433,2341,5," My daughter was given this Fox Hand Puppet for christmas. The puppet been well designed& is easy to use and is very cute for a fox !Foxy has inspired hours of  creativity fun  - and we then have tell a tale bedtime !This puppet a lovely simple hand puppet that my daughter loves."
7434,2341,5," My son loves his foxie hand puppet& I've also brought it as a gift for nieces/nephews and everyone who plays with this toy loves it& has a gorgeous life like fox face with lovely soft fur& the hands are puppetted to so you can make the fox do gestures like waving hello& and his mouth moves too so he can really talk to children. I first brought this fox puppet from Tesco's Home Store many years ago but they no longer stock it so I was so pleased when I found it on Amazon.  Highly recommended."
7435,2341,5," bought for my son as he wanted the same as the one at school.  well made and a nice toy"
7436,2342,5," thankyou for you fast and reliable service& my daughter loves her cuddlepets& she has most of them now& but this is her favourite one buy far now due to its colour of the pink.would recommend to everyonemany thanks"
7437,2342,5," Bought this for my daughter for her 5th birthday.  She saw the ad on the tv and that was it.  I ordered one and it arrived super quick and gave it to her for birthday& she was delighted and has not let it out of her sight.  It is made of good quality and the blanket is really soft and fleecy."
7438,2342,5," purchased for my daughter who loves animals& teddies and anything fluffy! This fits the bill with all aspects and is easy to carry around as is not too thick!"
7439,2342,3," Expensive for what it is.  It is basically a blanket with a bugs head.  The blanket isn't very big"
7440,2342,5," Bought these items for grand children at Christmas& one 8 years and one 3 years old.  They loved them.  Lovely soft fabric& bright colours& lovely designs and well made.  Would recommend."
7441,2342,5," My daughter turned 10 yesterday and had asked for one of these. I thought they were for smaller children but she loves hers. They are small but I guess they are more for tots"
7442,2342,3," Grandaughter loves this but I think it could possibly be priced cheaper& I do think that Â£19.99 is a tad expensive for what it is even though my grandaughter loves it."
7443,2342,5," It arrived very quickly.It is good quality fleece& very soft and snuggly.I got it for my daughter's birthday and she isthrilled by it."
7444,2343,5," really great item my kids loved them and they were so cheap would 100% recommend make great party bag toys too"
7445,2343,5," My daughter loves  her finger puppets. Good price compared to others I bought. VeryHappy with my purchase from yourselves"
7446,2343,5," Finger puppets for the children and adults all you need is a stage and your good to go. Great for Developing a Child's Imagination and Creativity"
7447,2343,5," Bought as a stocking filling and can't complaint! Brilliant value& little girl loves them& great addition to her puppet theatre!"
7448,2343,5," Great while feeding her... keeps her busy in the car.... I have to put a voice on and I'm sure she knows its me but she still loves it!"
7449,2343,5," Thank you so much for the puppets. Each family member is distinguishable& with cute details like the tie on the fathers shirt and the bun in the grandmothers hair. My kids loved them straight away.. aged 2 and 4. Definitely worth the money for the effort put into them. Don't know why some are complaining!"
7450,2343,4," Great value- 6 year old absolutely loves them"
7451,2343,5," Arrived quicker than expected. Had a look at them and there great. It'll make a perfect little Christmas gift for my daughter who will be 3 months. Definitely recommend to a friend"
7452,2344,5," The product is for my great niece and she will love it."
7453,2344,5," really well made one happy grandchild"
7454,2345,5," Just right to go with the book."
7455,2346,4," I wanted it to attract children's attention and I find that it is very well made& the colours are lovely& the material nice and soft and my hand being quite big& the puppet fits very well& as a matter of fact& it is if anything& on the large side.I would recommend this puppet."
7456,2346,2," The puppet I received isn't the 1 advertised in the pic which I think is a shame as the 1 I was sent is v hairy"
7457,2346,5," Very funny cockerel ! Lovely bright colours! Great hand puppet although i don't seem to be able to make him flap his wings that easily. Plenty of space inside& but i guess my hands are small/medium size."
7458,2346,5," someone bought me this for christmas as i LOVE CHICKENs and it is awesome  and soft and is funny aswell  the beak is wierd tho& because like you have to use one finger & but its aweosme non the less"
7459,2347,4," My 3 yr old son loves this. Nice bright colours and well made. Only slight concern is that stiff material (not sure if it's plastic or cardboard) for his jaws will withstand the enthusiastic cuddling it will get!"
7460,2347,5," bought to go with another one. My grandson loves them."
7461,2348,5," Charlie& 12 months old& just loves this.  Its big and fun and noisy& and everything you would want a crazy bird to be.  Not noticed any shedding fur& but I have noticed how all adults make a bee line for this puppet and just can't resist trying it out.  Will definitely get others from this company.  Great toy."
7462,2348,5," These are lovely& well-made and very high quality puppets.  The main body is a very thick& long-'fur' fabric (which can shed a little in its first few uses) and the feet and beak are made from brushed nylon.This large-size (approx 40cm long excluding tail and feet) puppet can be used by young children& teenagers or even adults and a 'baby bird' version is available purely for children.  I have large hands and long arms but still find them comfortable to use.  The large beak is very easy to operate and& unlike some other puppets which force the operator to move both the upper and lower beak/jaw& it is easy and comfortable to move only the lower beak.  This is a much more natural and realistic movement than raising the upper beak for the bird to 'speak' or squawk.  The squawker inside the mouth is surprisingly loud and makes a fairly realistic bird-squawk sound rather than a typical squeaker-squeak.  The puppets have different squawks so can 'communicate' together in a variety of tones and pitches but the squarks can also be removed& if preferred.I use these puppets to make entertainment videos for a mostly adult audience& including a special needs group of adults.  I've found that adults with a sense of humour seem to appreciate them just as much as children of all ages from toddlers to pre-teens.  They're very versatile& great fun and I think they offer exceptional value for money considering their quality.  I have nearly the full range of these birds and I generally operate them in pairs with them interacting together for performances.A very good buy and great fun too& limited only by your own or your child's creativity and imagination."
7463,2348,3," This is a lovely puppet and has a great realistic squawk. It is a good size and very colourful. My only issue with this puppet is that it fluffs so much and small threads keep coming off the puppet and I am concerned that my little one would choke on these small bits that keep coming off the puppet."
7464,2348,5," Lovely bright colours. Easy to get your hand into the puppet to open the mouth. Kids love the squeak. Both of my sons love playing with this puppet. My one year old laughs every time he hears the squeak.Best of all it gets the kids away from the tv and other devices and uses their imagination. Great for all kids of any age!The fur does pull out& cause it is long."
7465,2348,5," We love this puppet but it was a present for our granddaughter so we couldn't keep it :(.  Not so sure her father likes the squawk but it is removable if it becomes unbearable.  The ten year old loved it and was quickly playing out scenes with the puppet.  It's a decent size that can be used by adults of children and has quite an expressive face.  Maybe we'll have to buy one (or two) for our own amusement!"
7466,2348,4," My 5 year old son has wanted this puppet for a long time as they have a similar one at his school that they use for educational purposes. It's very well made and has become a little character in our family. My son is delighted with it. Only time will tell how long the squawking feature will last but it seems fairly robust."
7467,2348,5," Bright and colourful and the parrot squawk is fab!  We tried the smaller version of this one in a shop and found that the beak was a bit fiddly and small for even my 4 year old's hands& but this large one is perfect for both child and adult hands."
7468,2348,5," I think I should start a fan club for The Puppet Company.  All the puppets I've had from them have been beautiful quality& cute and fun.  In addition& I think they're great value for money& as I'd have happily paid more for them.  Great stuff."
7469,2349,5," I've been very impressed with the quality of this range of puppets - which is not conveyed by the photos. This bear is very well made from a very soft& thick and high quality& slightly curly& plush fabric and his soft claws are quite eye-catching.Although targetted at children he can also be used by adults - my hand is 19cm long and I can use him comfortably with a thumb and finger fingers inserted into the paws and two fingers operating his mouth.This bear from the range by The Puppet Company will not disappoint any adult or child looking to have a bit of fun!"
7470,2349,4," when i looked at the picture of this bear i thought to myself& awesome looks alright& so i ordered it and when it arrived i got the puppet out and felt the fur& i died from the level of softness the fur had. my hand fit comfortable in and the body length was perfect for me& like it was made for my arm& it was easy to control& MY ONLY CONCERN was that i could not move the mouth& this might just be me being stupid but likely i think it isn't.4/5"
7471,2349,5," I have bought four of these puppets for playing with children and the dog. I found this one very silky to the touch but the material was not as thick as on the lion& the pig or the polar bear. I only notice this when playing with the dog. Seriously though& these are extremely well made toys and will last for years of fun. I thoroughly recommend them"
7472,2349,5," We bought the long sleeved cat glove puppet for the great grandchildrenas well as this one.  Very well made ~ they both get used a lot.I would definitely recommend both of them& you just need lots ofimagination and small children."
7473,2349,3," Head on the puppet is heavy so it is a bit difficult to animate and move with your fingers. Also if you have small hands its hard to use. It has been loved though by my 3 year old I just wish I had got something a bit smaller."
7474,2349,4," would you be surprised that boys love these puppets& this one is soft and easy to use& and allows kids to speak through puppets what they may not want to speak themselves&"
7475,2349,5," This is a lovely super soft hand puppet that is just great to work with& it is very easy to move the arms at the same time as the mouth& would definitely reccomend"
7476,2349,4," I purchased this puppet to have some fun with my Granddaughter on Skype.  As she lives in the USA we speak quite often.  It is a great ice breaker and I love it."
7477,2350,5," Great hand puppet. Unfortunately did non really looked like a hen to me& but more like a cockerel so asked to return it (as i've also ordered a cockerel from them) and that was not a problem at all.Great and serious company! Highly recommend!"
7478,2351,5," I bought this for my son& but also for me to play with because I like to indulge in my theatre-y side with my captive audience. He (because we think it looks like a boy) is very expressive and great at telling stories and singing rhymes& like 'Horsey& horsey don't you stop' and he has quite a cheeky expression on his face& not sad or snooty at all& like a lot of horses are. The same horse cost over 40 in Italy! so I was chuffed to find him for under a tenner."
7479,2351,5," Amazon wouldn't expedite my order to ROI& but I contacted the vendor directly and they sorted it out so processing through this site should work now. I received my order in 2 days& and the product is as lovely as it looks in the photo. Their 6 year-old owner loves them and they also fit a ladies' hand. Lots of cuddly& role-playing fun with these cute puppets!"
7480,2351,4," Its a horse glove puppet& good quality and easy to use despite the lack of documentation. Works on both Right and Left hands but not so well on feet."
7481,2351,5," this is  a great quality item - lovely size - very well made and durable - kids at bookbug love it!"
7482,2352,5," A beautifully made puppet that I am sure my class will have a lot of fun with!"
7483,2353,5," I have just purchased this puppet and it is one of the funniest ones I've seen. What I love about it is that it makes you talk. With others I keep on thinking on what to talk about& but holding the puppet in one hand and the rod in the other you can easily make up a fun little story or a conversation with kids (and adults& too). Love the quality& love the flexibility and the variation of faces you can create with it. My kids love the best when I mimmic actions and make them guess what Mr King is trying to do.... Real fun!"
7484,2353,5," Bought this puppet with 3 others from the range as a birthday present for my daughter. They are even better than I expected. Good quality and a fantastic toy for exhibiting imagination. If you are thinking of puppets I would definately recommend this range."
7485,2353,5," I bought this puppet for my niece and nephew's to share& along with a couple of others and the puppet theatre. Great quality as to be expected from Melissa and Doug. Very hard wearing and they look like Jim Henson puppets! What more could you want?!"
7486,2353,5," my 3 year old daughter loves this puppet. Very reasonable price and hours of enjoyment. bought princess but the mouth doesnt close properly. The king's mouth is perfect!"
7487,2353,5," I would recommend this puppet. My six year old boy loves it even after 3 months he still often plays with it and has it on his bed at night. Well made and great fun."
7488,2353,5," My 3-year old loves it!  it's big enough to fit on an adult's hand& but doesn't slip off her little hand either.  It's great fun and nice quality!"
7489,2353,5," Lovely puppet and very good price & cheapest by far for this quality item&brought as a Xmas present for granddaughter aged 4"
7490,2354,4," My daughter loves this puppet but one of the long antennae/hair bits has broken off after only a few weeks of play. The eyes are also looking quite scratched and bits of paint have come off."
7491,2354,4," Our 7 yr old daughter's had great fun with this since her birthday& may not be that educational& however her imagination is the limit! It's nicely made& with a knitted sleeve and poseable antennae. The squeaker in its tongue is a tad tricky to squeak for her due to her fingers not being quite long enough yet& but that will remedy in time!Her favourite |trick| is to pop its head out the car window much to the amusement of onlookers."
7492,2354,5," These are well-made& good quality& durable puppet toys made from quality materials in bright colours with appealing& cheerful designs and facial expressions.  They can easily be animated and brought to life by any child or adult with a playful side and some imagination.  Their mouths are easy to work& especially for an adult who will also have the finger strength and dexterity to squeeze the small squeaker in the puppet's tongue.I like to use a pair of puppets to interact together and find 'Lipstick'& whom I consider female due to her pointy red lips& works well with the rest of the sockette range as illustrated by my uploaded photos.They're not just for children - I'm a mature (well& perhaps that is questionable...) adult with long arms and large hands and I find the puppets a perfect size for my arm and hand and very easy to operate.They'll provide ongoing fun and amusement limited only by the user's imagination.A great buy and fantastic value for money too!"
7493,2354,5," I bought this puppet for my daughter who is doing Primary Teaching at University. She is very pleased as she feels it is a good visual aid for the children and encourages communication."
7494,2354,5," Brought this product for a student and she absolutely loved it. It would be handy for your fist teaching job."
7495,2354,5," Bought for christmas but I am very happy with the quality of the puppet and think that the kids with love it& I would recommend this item to a friend."
7496,2354,5," This puppet should give my great grandson many happy hours& I understand that Lipstick along with Scorch are his favourites. The price does not reflect the quality which is excellent and delivery was prompt.  I have dealt with this company before and have found their service to be prompt and reliable and when looking for a gift of this kind I would not hesitate to order from them again. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable source of quality and with efficient service. Thank you to all concerned."
7497,2354,5," I bought this puppet for our 4 month old son.  He loves it!  The puppet is even better than in the picture in terms of quality and character."
7498,2355,2," I have several of these puppets and most have this sort of fly away |fur| on them but this one shed so badly had to throw it away.  Couldn't give it to a kid for fear their parents would hate me for messing up their house with this stuff.  I mean it shed all over the place and the pinky parts were also covered with purple fur.  I have the bird of paradise with the same fur by the same puppet company but it doesn't shed."
7499,2355,5," I bought this for my  10 year old daughter who is |Emu| mad.  The blue emu puppet wasn't quite as appealing and the ostrich is a great shape and more similar to TV Emu.  We had seen this one at Hamleys (much more expensive& so well done as usual Amazon!) and she adored it.  It is a well made toy and is constantly getting up to mischief in our house."
7500,2355,3," I bought this puppet for my five year old nephew& as it was described as being suitable for children and looked like fun. When it arrived& I found I could only just reach my own hand to the end of the beak to squeak it and there was no way a five year old would. It would probably be ok for a teenage child."
7501,2355,5," It's a little cumbersome for my 4 yr old yet& but she loves it when I play with her using it& while she uses another puppet that is a bit smaller. Great for imaginative play& and a good ice breaker when other kids come over. Well made& and a substantial toy for the price. Great buy."
7502,2356,4," The product is very well made and is a lovely product to entertain the kids with having purchased several different manhattan toys I have found them to be worth their money. Unlike some products on the market I feel this product will last for a long time before the children will grow tired with it plus it helps to keep them interested in stories that contain elephants as we use the hand puppet to join in with the stories as well as making up our own."
7503,2357,4," delivery good. item great. well made.  i got this to play with my 2 year old grandson via SKYPE .  he loves it when the lion trys to eat his |Maka'"
7504,2358,5," We actually bought this for a Dog rather than a Child. We bought it at Christmas and its still completely intact. Its now his favourite Toy. Its better than a lot of other hand puppets as you move all for legs and nose with your fingers. Hours of fun for both Dogs and Children."
7505,2359,5," I bought this for my lizard mad sons 3rd christmas. Ok& so its an iguana... but its a lovely soft quality toy which has initiated creative play and my son chose this as his favourite toy for show and tell it nursery. In his words 'its a lovely green colour& you put your hand inside and you can make him dance and crawl& he has nice black feet and a very long tail& I love him!'All in all a lovely traditional toy."
7506,2360,5," This is a brilliant toy which I originally spotted in John Lewis and my daughter fell in love with it. It was much cheaper from the Puppet Company and arrived really quickly. I'm sure it's going to drive us bananas over Christmas but will make one little girl very happy."
7507,2360,5," My 3 year old met and fell in love with one of these puppets at Longleat Safari Park - needless to say I have purchased it for her for Christmas.  Can't wait!!  Its an excellent puppet& well made& a good size and full of character!"
7508,2360,5," I bought this for my niece and she loved it. It has a squeeker in its beak so it also makes a noise. It seems well put together and good quality."
7509,2361,5," Great buy as we all love hacker"
7510,2362,3," Wool hair not stuck on tidy head where you put fingers not easy to find for a child other wise it is a pretty princess"
7511,2362,5," I bought this together with the Prince and Dragon for two of my grandchildren for Christmas.The puppets were all lovely and the princess has such a nice face. The quality and detail was very good. The only problem is my arthriticy hand is too big to get inside the arms of the puppet!"
7512,2362,5," This is a well made glove puppet and was just right for the age group I bought for. Arrived promptly and well packaged."
7513,2363,5," These products added to our grandchild's puppet theater beautifully and have given a great deal of pleasure. I suppose it partly depends on how much effort is put into showing the potential of the toy to the child  receiving it. In any event& our grand-daughter has loved them and has great fun putting on performances with them."
7514,2363,5," These are good we all bought granddaughter different one as she having theatre from Santa"
7515,2363,5," Well made."
7516,2363,5," GOOD"
7517,2364,5," My granddaughter was absolutely delighted with lilabell for her birthday and all the family where enthralled with the enaction between them.She takes lilabell to bed with her and they have become firm friends."
7518,2365,5," Such a great puppet& very well made!"
7519,2366,5," Products by the Puppet Company are always well-made& attractive and well priced but this puppet is a particular gem.  I bought it as I am currently a student teacher and have been using it in lessons with children aged 3-4.  They love it and it has captured their imagination.  Not only is it excellent for behaviour management as the rabbit is shy and can hide/go to sleep in his lettuce if the children misbehave but it is a stimulus for all kind of curriculum topics.  For example& the puppet has prompted discussion about healthy eating& where we live& what we needs to live and how we see/hear etc.  The insect finger puppets hiding in the lettuce leaves are great for minibeast topics and the children enjoy plying with them.As the rabbit is very soft the children love to stroke his fur.  As the lettuce hides your hand it is not obvious to the children that the rabbit is a puppet.  I have also used with older children and they have responded well to it too.I would highly recommend this puppet as a educational tool or as a fun toy for a child to play with."
7520,2366,5," This puppet is just beautiful. It is more effective than a lot of puppets as the lettuce conceals your hand meaning it is really brought to life. Each of the small creatures that live in the leaves (finger puppets) are nicely made and make it good value for money. It says 3+ but I have bought it for younger children as I will use it for storytelling and not as a regular day to day toy. Ideal for a grandparent to keep at home for when the kids visit!"
7521,2366,5," This rabbit is yet another beautiful creation by the people at puppets by post. I have used him in 3 different educational situations and he has triumphed in each one. He was popular with the little children but also with the teenagers I teach.Amazing value for such a sweet thing."
7522,2366,5," Both my little grandson and the children in my nursery class love this puppet.  He is a perfect resource for captivating their attention and the minibeasts are prompts for nursey rhymes.  Just be careful not to lose them. Well worth the money."
7523,2366,5," This is a  fabulously well made puppet.It is tactile& soft& and my baby is in love with it. The detail and quality of the whole thing& especially the little bugs& is almost unbelievable at that price. Great fun and lovely to look at."
7524,2366,5," Great toy for story-telling! I use it with my grandaughter whenever we read Peter Rabbit stories together. We also use it for singing the |Peter Rabbit has a .... on his nose| song which kids love. Identifying the insects and looking for the real life version is also a great outdoors activity& kids love bugs! My grandaughter (2 years old) also enjoys tucking the insects back into the leaves |to sleep| when we have finished with Peter - a great tidy up incentive. Peter has inspired me to buy a few more puppets& I'd forgotten how much fun they can be.Rabbit in A Lettuce Hideaway Puppet"
7525,2366,5," I knew the puppet for a long time as a storyteller of my friends used it. She's no more in my town& and I asked her if I could have the same puppet& which is why I ordered it and am very satisfied. It offers many opportunities in the animation library: discussion& poetry& song& complicity ... It is pleasant to handle& nice& easy and so soft to the touch!The kids love it too!Its price is high but worth it!"
7526,2366,4," Bought this product after seeing it on holiday& trying it out& then passing it by.Decided on arrival home to price compare and then bought this from Amazon.A well made product with various uses.Can be a bit tricky to get the fingers in place for operating the mouth and twitching the nose.Found this rabbit to give different expressions compared to the one i saw on holiday& but i'm sure due to the manufacturing techniques each one should be expected to be different"
7527,2367,4," This puppet is lovely and soft. The sleeve length is really good  as it comes all the way to the elbow."
7528,2367,2," The lion doesn't have puppet company branding/label on it& the sleeve isn't as long and the fur is not at all as good quality as the crocodile or the leopard (also the face not as attractive as in the picture). The nose is drawn out in some kind of ink (looks like felt tip!) which seems to have rubbed off on the fur just above the nose. Will still be good fun to play with I hope and I've got no time to return it as it's a gift - but I would have bought one of the others if I'd known& and I'm questioning why it doesn't have the puppet company label or packaging... Suggest you get one of the others."
7529,2367,5," This hand puppet is gorgeous.  It looks wonderful& seems well made and easily washable and the kids and parents love the creative conversations it provokes."
7530,2367,4," Very cute product and perfect for kids& my child absolutely loves this toy& and the lion goes everywhere with us& on holiday& away for weekends& in the house. It is very safe to use& the hair does not fall out either& so no worries about any suffocation. Fits easy over the hand."
7531,2367,5," Lovely product. I actually bought it for my cat so we could play fight with him and he loves it. It is still in excellent condition despite the punishment!"
7532,2368,5," Well made using decent materials and slightly larger than you might think from the description. My 3 year old little girl believes the puppets are real when i put on a show and loves them & even asking questions to them about what they are doing. Excellent  learning tool for pre school and fun as well. Old school fun  for kids you cant duplicate with a games console"
7533,2368,5," The puppet is bigger than it looks on the image and it is easy to use.You can also see that it is done with good materials.I really recommed this product."
7534,2368,5," Lots of fun from the moment the bag was ripped off. Very well made and looks exactly like the original puppets :) I got Gobo and Wembley too so lots of fun ahead!"
7535,2368,4," Bought this as a present for a one year old and she loved it! Probably much easier for kids to work the puppet's mouth - my man hand was a bit too big!"
7536,2368,5," Absolutely adore this Fraggle Rock hand puppet& brought back so many childhood memories of watching the TV programme!! ðŸ˜Š x"
7537,2369,5," When this puppet entered our lives two years ago& we didn't know what hit us.  He has taken on his own very cheeky personality and is often very rude to members of our family.  He truly is the most played-with soft toy in my daugther's bedroom and mum and dad have as much fun as she does.  An absolute hit& and am now looking for a girlfriend for him from the Puppet Company range to keep him in check.  When his eyes are staring at you& he really does take on a life of his own& and you can enter his make-believe world.  He often upsets my daughter by throwing her favourite teddy across the room (I think he's jealous)& so she has to get very cross with him sometimes - not that he cares! The tongue has a squeak pad inside it which is also fun to use for effect."
7538,2369,5," Haha .. now you must realise that I am 51 years of age .  My husband  bought me one of these for Christmas because I'm wanting to do a video review of a back operation I am having done whenever the NHS decide they can  agree on a date.  Oh Hum !He freaked everyone out on Christmas Day as he took on a life of his own .. everyone was getting a little worried for my sanity and put it down to my strong medication mixed with champagne .. but ah& I know better !!Scorch is amazing!  His little face is full of character for |just| a puppet ... (I had to whisper the puppet bit as if he had herard my there would be hell to pay and he would probably sulk for ages)He's brought tears of laughter to everyone he has met and if that's not enough to give this *whisper* puppet& 100% then I don't know what can!I will be blogging with him from Hospital as I am having a spinal cord stimulator fitted with a laminectomy and paddle lead into my spine and hope that the blog will be interesting to others going through the same thing.  I'm a tad camera shy& so with the help of Scorch& I can tell my story.Worth every single penny."
7539,2369,5," Well& this puppet has been one of the best buys ever! My 3 year old girl is hooked on him. When he talks to her she can listen and talk back to him for ages. A great problem solving tool. As kids open up to puppets easily& so may help get things off their mind.My 1 year old son loves when the puppet tries to eat his hand. The puppet's mouth has a squeaker in the tongue which is quite comical.The puppet's wide mouth is excellent for conveying conversations& I reckon that is why so many kids have been hooked on him. I so love making him sing& what an experience to see the lovely expression on the kids faces!Overall& an absolutely amazing product."
7540,2369,5," Scorch is great fun& he's bright and friendly looking and my little boy is totally taken with him. He is great quality and should wear well. He is bigger than I imagined and therefore more suited to an adult arm/hand but that doesn't stop my little one having a go!! Good fun for story telling and chasing toddlers!!!!"
7541,2369,4," Illustrations in web page could have been better.  Product exceeded expectations and was very well recieved.  Everybody wanted one"
7542,2369,5," These at large puppets& ideal for all ages of children. I love that they are made up creatures"
7543,2369,5," Very pleased with my purchase. Very fun and colourful. Good quality also love the squeak! Can't wait to introduce him to the class once I'm on placement in a primary school."
7544,2369,5," My one year old son loves this puppet and it's a great way to teach the parts of the body.  It also tickles me that some other children are a bit scared of it.  Great fun."
7545,2370,5," Brought as xmas present for 10 year old daughter& who loves it& well made hand puppet at a great price& highly recomended."
7546,2370,5," Fantastic!My Nephew loved them aswel as my Brother!They are Bright and colorful and really attracted his Attention!Purchased Rainbow and Scorch!Very Happy!"
7547,2370,5," beautiful product& lovely material! it got here in great timing. the product quality is very good! i am a very satisfied customer with this product thank you."
7548,2370,5," Good quality puppet&bright nice colours&my doughter loves it&I have to buy another one but different monster&I recomendet it in 100%"
7549,2370,5," Mother inlaw brought this for when she skypes her grandson in Australia& he absolutely loves it& nice"
7550,2370,5," Grandson didn't want to put them down on Christmas day and beats a smelly old sock lovely and colourful too"
7551,2370,5," Just great. My sister was so happy with it. She is a teacher"
7552,2370,5," Had brilliant fun with grandchildren& puppet durable and funny&took a lot of handling and still looked fresh after play time.Children could not get enough of the puppet."
7553,2371,5," I've been very impressed with the quality of this range of puppets - which is not conveyed by the photos. They are very well made from quality plush fabric and are surprisingly life-like with good features.Although targetted at children they can also be used by adults - my hand is 19cm long and I can use it comfortably with a thumb and finger fingers inserted into the paws and two fingers operating the mouth.This range by The Puppet Company will not disappoint an adult or child looking to have a bit of fun!"
7554,2371,5," Our 4-year-old granddaughter loves role play& so we decided to buy her glove puppets for her birthday - this and the wolf puppet. She was absolutely delighted with them& and what pleased us most was that we could wear them too& they're so roomy! Not only that& they're really well made and should last for ages. All in all& excellent value for money!My wife and I have no reservations in recommending this item to anyone else who's thinking of buying a glove puppet."
7555,2371,5," Excellent quality& as are all of the Puppet Company toys. Keeping our daughter easily entertained"
7556,2371,5," We bought it as a back up to my daughter's favourite puppet.. and she likes them equally as much.  This item is very well made and very cute with a lot of attention to detail."
7557,2372,5," I hadn't even considered this as a toy. That's because I bought it for myself and I'm a 58 year old Grandmother! :)I like to buy something Christmassy each year for the home& and this was my choice for 2010. I enjoy packing things away each new year& and then finding them again months later when Christmas comes around again.  I completely forgot to review it& but was reminded by Amazon when reviewing another purchase today.Therefore my surprise when I was asked about this toys value educationally& for fun and durability.My five youngest grandchildren aged 18 months - 7 years loved it and all of them played with it. It's good for developing small motor skills. For learning the concept of size and shape. We did role play with a family of Santa's. Durability? It survived one season fully intact. I'm looking forward to sharing again this year."
7558,2372,4," This product is decorative and great fun. I bought this one for my son as there don't seem to be any traditionally aimed at boys. My daughter has always enjoyed her doll particularly the stacking and un-stacking play.These look good on the bookshelf too.One small observation is that being made of thin balsa wood& they feel like they may crack if handled too roughly."
7559,2372,5," Santas a little stiff to open at first but a little candle wax fixed that and it would be no use if they were slack.  My grandchildren love them& especially the tiny one."
7560,2372,5," My 2 year old just loved these and had great fun playing with them at christmas i would def recommend"
7561,2372,5," Proved a hit at Christmas& children didn't leave them alone!  A little stiff taking apart when first used but gradually easier after frequent use.  Although a little 'pricey' would definitely recommend."
7562,2372,5," These are lovely& I bought them for my childminding setting for our Christmas planning to help children learn to differentiate between big and small& what a lovely festive learning resource."
7563,2372,3," Slightly smaller than I anticipated meaning the last few aren't really safe for my 16 month old. Decorated well and generally well made apart from being a little stiff."
7564,2372,5," My 3 and 1 year old have played with this long after Christmas Day... They both find it quite fascinating and it's good for the little ones hand to eye co-ordination."
7565,2373,5," Absolutely love this puppet& I use it for phonics in my nursery class. It looks more expensive than what I paid for it."
7566,2373,5," Fab product made well and fun"
7567,2373,4," Children loved it"
7568,2374,5," Beautifully made and perfect size - nice and large& great for adult hands.  And very good value.  My children love this puppet and all the others I have in this range. (In a perfect world& I think I would prefer these puppets to have round& rather than flat heads& and I'd prefer to be able to manipulate the mouth& as one can with most or all of the Puppet Company's animal puppets"
7569,2374,5," Beautifully made and good looking puppet. Bit expensive but will last."
7570,2374,5," Quite small& nevertheless very nice"
7571,2374,4," good quality"
7572,2375,5," It's beautiful!!I saw this in a shop while on holidays and immediately fell for it. It's a gorgeous puppet!I bought it and have since bought 4 more puppets by Folkmanis. Beautiful colours and detail. Great for using while telling stories to the children"
7573,2376,5," :)"
7574,2377,5," a great little addition to my family&takes a while to get used to at first that's why ive waited so long to review it&but is easy and fun to use after some practise"
7575,2378,5," I gave this to my nephew for his 2nd birthday yesterday and he loved it so much that it wouldnt go back away when he needed to go somewhere lol It is an amazing product and I would recommend it to anyone."
7576,2378,3," Bought this for the nursery& it is a lovely idea and the children enjoyed playing with the characters after reading the story& however I felt that the quality of the item did not represent the price.  The giant is made quite well but the other characters not so great.  Quite disappointing"
7577,2378,5," Bought this for my 3 year old son who loves the jack and the beanstalk book&he has spent hours playing with these....acting out the story...great fun!!!! fast delivery aswell...would recommend"
7578,2378,5," An excellent resource for my reception class to use during our traditional tales theme while role playing during child initiated play."
7579,2378,5," I used the puupets to retell the story of Jack and The Beanstalk towards the end of 2 weeks on the story. I added extra elements and the children howled with laughter. They were so engaged. Afterwards they took turns to use the puppets to do their own retelling whilst other children filmed them on the ipad."
7580,2378,4," Giant puppet excellent&although a finger hole in the head  allowing the puppet's head to move&would be an improvement. As finger puppets go&the three other figures are OK for children. I've added an old crone for the giant's wife"
7581,2378,5," These were great. Good sizes and good quality - especially the giant! The kids love them and they look as if they will stand up to a fair amount of wear and tear (by 60 6 year olds!) The slight negative is the beanstalk which is only made from cardboard."
7582,2378,1," This product was purchased to be included in a |Storysack|. The quality is not what I expected (very poor) and the product definitely isn't value for money. I won't be buying from this supplier again."
7583,2379,5," A lovely& smiling& puppet that invites children to enter a world of imagination.  Very well made and with a slight jingle!"
7584,2379,5," This is a well made and beautiful toy.It is a little small for my hand but then it for children and not a large adult hand!Price was great too."
7585,2379,5," Great fun& excellent quality& beautiful puppet. Very good value for money. We definitely recommend this for creative and imaginative  kids of all ages"
7586,2380,5," These are lovely& well-made and very high quality puppets.  The main body is a very thick& long-'fur' fabric (which can shed a little in its first few uses) and the feet and beak are made from brushed nylon - see my uploaded photos (above).This large-size (approx 40cm long excluding tail/feet) puppet can be used by young children& teenagers or even adults and a 'baby bird' version is available purely for children.  I have large hands and long arms but still find them comfortable to use.  The large beak is very easy to operate and& unlike some other puppets which force the operator to move both the upper and lower beak/jaw& it is easy and comfortable to move only the lower beak.  This is a much more natural and realistic movement than raising the upper beak for the bird to 'speak' or squawk.  The squawker inside the mouth is surprisingly loud and makes a fairly realistic bird-squawk sound rather than a typical squeaker-squeak.  The puppets have different squawks so can 'communicate' together in a variety of tones and pitches but the squarks can also be removed& if preferred.I use these puppets to make entertainment videos for a mostly adult audience& including a special needs group of adults.  I've found that adults with a sense of humour seem to appreciate them just as much as children of all ages& from toddlers to pre-teens.  They're very versatile& great fun and I think they offer exceptional value for money considering their quality.  I have nearly the full range of these birds and I generally operate them in pairs with them interacting together for performances.  This crow is a good partner for the more colourful birds in the range.A very good buy and great fun too& limited only by your own or your child's creativity and imagination."
7587,2380,5," This is our second puppet from The Puppet Company and I can't praise both the puppets and the company highly enough. The crow is large with lovely soft black plumage and bright yellow beak and feet. He is well-made and full of character. My 10-year-old son loved him on sight and his wonderful caw is being well used. We already had the Green Amazon parrot puppet who is also fantastic. They are an exuberant pair and a lot of fun for kids and adults. What I really like is that they are not the same puppet just in different colours. The crows eyes are to the front of his face& the parrot's are to more to the sides"
7588,2380,5," I brought this item for my 11 year old niece who has autism. She didn't like it at first and refused flatly to operate him. As I'd brought the monster puppets for her brother and cousins& I knew she wouldn't be able to relate to a 'monster' character easily which was why I chose a bird.With the help of my other niece we gave the crow an identity by creating a name and  'Collin the Crow' was born. This was so important because now she could relate to it on friendly terms. Once we'd done this she addressed Collin and not me who was operating him and doing his voice.Overall& I think this puppet has enormous potential in getting information through to my niece as she was attentive when 'he' spoke and she did pay attention to the detail in what he was saying.I was very happy with the purchase and would highly recommend these puppets if you want to encourage your children to be creative and imaginative through play no matter what they're capabilities."
7589,2380,5," This is a great educational toy& even larger than I expected from the images available (the body part reaches down to my elbow)& and with a surprisingly clear |squawk| in his beak.  Fun for younger pupils and also for the family!!  The crow's |feathers| are made of floppy black fur and this gives him a crazy& beady-eyed look which is very impressive.  Young kids believe he's real after a few seconds. With the right activities and a bit of imagaination he can be made an essential part of the classroom in a question of a couple of days.I'm delighted with the purchase& especially at the mroe than reasonable price."
7590,2380,5," Both my 4 and 7 year olds love this toy& and have played with it for hours. The squeaker in the beak is a little annoying at first& but when you see how much fun the kids have with it& it seems worth it somehow. I have bought several other puppets (not all have squeakers) and every child that sees them wants to play with them. Great ice breakers and hours of fun to be had."
7591,2380,5," My little guy loves his crow! We don't let him play with it himself as he is only 9 months& but he really enjoys watching him fly around squawking. Then he attacks Daddy to howls of amusement. The contrast between colours seems to really engage him too. Very happy with it and would definitely purchase another from this brand"
7592,2380,4," This puppet is brilliant and his expression is great. My 3 year old grandson adores it.  The only reason it hasn't got 5 stars is that the |feathers| are shedding  a lot and this could be a problem with a smaller child.  Maybe we were just unlucky and I hope this doesn't happen normally."
7593,2381,5," Nice"
7594,2382,5," Love it ! Exactly as pictured"
7595,2383,4," The telltale theatre and shop is a lovely toy.  It is easy to put together& yet sturdy enough.  My children (7 and 4) enjoy playing with it a lot - with puppets& or as a shop.  It is also nice to show the grandparents who bought it for them.  It is bright and colourful and well made."
7596,2383,5," Really good bit of kit - well constructed and good value for money. Bought for our 4 year old granddaughter for Xmas and she took to it immediately. Even better that it doubles up as a shop."
7597,2383,5," I felt confident in ordering this toy for my grandchildren aged 2& 3 and 4 because the reviews I had read were very good and I felt that it would have good play value.  I didn't expect the fabric used in the toy to be such good quality and so well made so I was very pleasantly surprised. Lovely silky theatre hangings and a srong looking cotton twill for the shop. I usually leave the assembly of toys to my husband& but I couldn't wait to put the theatre together.  Assembly time was 20 minutes and will be much quicker next time now I have the hang of it.  It was very easy to assemble - no screws or complicated instructions.  I like the fact that this toy can be used on a table top without the bottom half& or free standing.  It can be taken apart and stored in the compact and fairly strong cardboard box with carry handle when its not being used. It arrived within 4 days and cost Â£12 less than the same one in my local toy shop. This is one of the nicest toys I have ever bought& I definitely recommend it"
7598,2383,3," I was really excited when we bought this. It looks fab& so colourful. It was easy to assemble. BUT it falls apart really easily. The children only have to lean on it and it breaks apart. I'm afraid I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
7599,2383,1," We got this for my daughter's 4th birthday and were very happy for the first week.. It just falls apart whenever you move it or touch it!! Would not recommend. I through mine away today! very upset.."
7600,2383,5," This theatre is great fun our grand-daughters just love it and write stories before hand and give us a show.Very easy to assemble just slots into place.  However& instructions not brilliant."
7601,2383,1," After reading all of the positive reviews about this puppet theatre and shop and doing research into others& I chose this product.  It looks great but it has sadly been nothing but a disappointment since we tried to use it.  From our experience& it is not robust or durable or sturdy.  It falls apart when you simply try to move it a couple of inches.  It can't be lifted up and placed somewhere else as the parts do not fit tightly in place.  The sides are forever coming out of the base.  The curtain rods are forever falling out of the sides and so on!  The last straw was as we were trying to set it up again for playing with this morning& we noticed that the curtain fabric has been poorly stitched and is fraying& so it cannot be repaired.  To be honest& it is a great looking toy and we had high hopes for some laughter as my daughter |performed|. Instead& it's me performing badly everytime she wants to play with it because of my frustrations about it constantly falling apart.  We could glue the dowling pieces or screw the pieces into place but this defeats the purpose of the dual shop/theatre functionality.  Furthermore& it means that it can't be stored for use at a later date or packed up conveniently. Sadly wouldn't recommend. Better off sticking a piece of fabric across a door frame!"
7602,2383,4," Bought as a present for my 5 year old daughter. She opened it on Christmas Day and was keen to set it up straight away.Easy to assemble& well made and robust."
7603,2384,5," It is definitely worth wading through the screens and not going for the first few items that show.  Found him after spending ages and he is definitely worth every penny.  It is a little on the small side for an adult hand& but is still OK.  Nicely made and is a nice addition to my story telling puppets."
7604,2385,5," Loved him so much& that I bought TWO.Of the 6 made by the Puppet Company& this fella is by far the most adorable. Just something about his eyes& not unlike those on Gromit from Aardman's Wallace"
7605,2385,5," I ordered this for my younger sister (aged 19!) christmas pressie& and she loved it.  she named it jaffer and we had a lot of fun playing with it over the christmas holidays.  It came very quickly and is quite big& so its great value for money.  It doesn't leave orange hair everywhere which is great!  Would highly recomend it to anybody of any age!"
7606,2385,5," My daughter loves this. He's been quickly named and is thought of as a |person| while at the same time she knows he's only animate if one of us |helps| him."
7607,2385,5," GREAT SERVICE!LOVE FROM FIRST SIGHT! HE IS SOO COOL! LITTLE BIT FLUFFY.  WE CALL HIM |GINGER|. OUR LO LOVES HIM AND SPEAKING TO GINGER ALL THE TIME !"
7608,2385,5," my boys adore this puppet&t hey have learning difficulties and really related to puppets. Well made and an excellent product."
7609,2385,5," I was entering a local talent show and lots of little girls were entering to sing or dance to 'Let it go'. I thought ventriloquism would be funny and would give the audience some laughs. So i bought 'Terry' and practised lots for my big moment. And you'll never believe it- thanks to Terry with his hilarious'Macaroni Cheese addiction'& I won the show with 1st prize! I was over joyed and now it is a hobby of mine"
7610,2385,3," I bought this and another Puppet Company puppet. They're both really nice toys and my five year old daughter loves them both& but there's one serious problem with both. Lots of 'fur' comes off both of them. They both shed over clothes etc and I'd never want them near an infant/toddler as I'd worry they could choke on them. Neither toy is 'bald' after a few days play& but it is a concern."
7611,2385,5," Third puppet we have from the Puppet Company and they are superb quality. No hair loss etc. even after years of rough play. Much better than some cheaper ones and worth the money"
7612,2386,5," This puppet is gorgeous to look at.  Really beautiful.  I bought it for my brother and his kids (aged 3"
7613,2386,5," You have to hold this puppet to appreciate it!  Such lovely quality and detail it is excellent value for money.  I have bought several of these puppets and they have been a delight to open.  They make excellent teaching aids and would be a lovely toy for a child.  Very well made& they can withstand a classroom full of children& I am pleased with my purchase."
7614,2386,4," The puppet company are on to a winner with this selection of hand puppets& they are well made and fun products especially over christmas. Allows roll play for children and adults& beautifully made& good quality products. Useable to store small pyjamas in as well and left on the bed when not in use& highly recommend."
7615,2386,5," I bought this for my baby daughter who is now 6 months old and absolutely loves this puppet. The quality is excellent& such soft fur and attention to detail. The price very reasonable and I would not hesitate to recommend this product. In fact I am intending to buy the giraffe puppet to go with it very soon....."
7616,2386,5," Purchased for a 1 year old this puppet is lovely and soft. It's a reasonable sized puppet& but this adds to the fun and feel of the item.  A really lovely toy which made a great 1st birthday present."
7617,2386,5," I bought this and the lion hand puppet for twin nieces for Christmas. The quality is absolutely fantastic - super soft and superbly made& a real gift to treasure that will last the years."
7618,2386,5," Much loved puppet. Super for imaginative play and encourages our grandchildren to look after the animals.  A super company and we have many of their puppets. Always good value."
7619,2386,5," The elephant is a really high quality toy.  The fur is very soft and my daughter loves cuddling him. I would recommend this item for any child under ten years."
7620,2387,5," Received product very quickly& packaged lovely and have to say I was very very impressed.  Absolutely worth the money& I actually went on to buy another.  Would recommend to anyone.  So pleased with my purchase."
7621,2387,5," This is a real favourite with my grandddaughter who has named the puppet and shares everything with her. I have to operate and speak for her....proving difficult for a six year old to manipulate& but as a |companion|.... excellent."
7622,2387,5," Bought one each for our 7-year old twins who made them come alive immediately. Easy to operate by small hands"
7623,2387,5," Good product which works well and was delivered on time maybe a bit too costly but my partner uses it for her job as she is a primary school teacher. kids love it."
7624,2387,4," Hard if not near impossible to move the mouth as well as the arms... but looks like a quality item& well made and you can tell it will be popular with the kids."
7625,2387,3," This was not the toy that I thought& but was entirely my own fault as I did not check measurements. Thought it was much larger!!!!"
7626,2387,3," She looks beautiful but there is a flaw - I have large& strong hands through years of piano/keyboard playing but:If your thumb and little finger are used to function the arms& effectively functioning the mouth is going to be TOUGH.  To use the mouth properly& you need your first two fingers and thumb to move it - this leaves an 'empty' arm causing your puppet to appear lop sided.But - she looks terrific& cute - well made bar the issue described."
7627,2387,5," My KS2 pupils love the boy and girl puppets. They are great for demonstrating how to meet and greet. Even the shyest child will kiss them on both cheeks or shake hands with them.The pupils love to use them to act out little scenes &"
7628,2388,4," I purchased one of these puppets from a local puppet shop a while ago and it's brilliant. It works very well to move around and give character to& as well as it being the beloved 'Chef Excellence' from Ashens on YouTube. I love it and you'll love it to probably."
7629,2388,1," This is a well made& good looking toy as you would expect from Melissa"
7630,2388,4," I have a lot of these puppets& including the cook. Yes& you only have a stick to move the puppets hands but never the less. He is of good quality and for that price (15 Pounds) it is hard to find a puppet like that. The children like the clumsy cook and find him hilarious."
7631,2388,5," I bought this for some children's work. I was immediately impressed with the quality& and the kids really loved him ( I turned him into an Italian!)Really good value for money - and I would certainly consider buying more from M"
7632,2388,5," These puppets are excellent value for money. Really good quality and excellent for the children to play with to make shows. They look like they are straight out of the muppet show."
7633,2388,5," Great Quality and would purchase more. I love the Melissa and Doug line...You just can't go wrong .... Real hit in our house and even the dog loves it!"
7634,2388,5," It's such a fantastic puppet! 5 stars! If you want to buy a puppet for a video or play& definitely buy these type of puppets! :)"
7635,2388,5," My little boy saw this on a you tube video and had to have it! His twin got the policeman! They play with them all the time!!"
7636,2389,5," My little Grand-daughter was really happy with this gift - she loves it.  So I intend to buy the others in the set for her.  She has such a vivid imagination I know she'll go on playing with them!"
7637,2390,5," I bought this for my 10 year old son and subsequently had to get one for my 7 year old who has now got all his friends buying them. Fabulous good quality toy and lovely to see boys really enjoying a toy with no screen in sight! Would definitely recommend."
7638,2390,5," This toy gets a great reaction from my nine month old baby. He laughs out loud and particularly loves it when the fire man |bites| his fingers and nost. Love it."
7639,2390,5," had lots of the melissa and doug puppets all are amazing sturdy and long lasting would recommend to spend a little more on these as are very well made"
7640,2390,5," Lovely puppet and very good price & cheapest by far for this quality item &brought as a Xmas present for granddaughter aged 4"
7641,2390,5," Another great addition to my puppet collection. It worked perfectly with the CD's I had already purchased. The kids loved it."
7642,2391,5," I first saw this pirate in a holiday flat in the Isle of Wight.  I fell in love with him and was determined to buy one when I got home.  He looked so gorgeous& very well made& from beautiful materials.  His face& thick plait& beard etc were nothing short of charming.  His red silky coat& his buckled boot& everything gorgeous.  What topped the |look| off though was his golden scabbard across his shoulder and the removeable golden sword.  I was thrilled to find one on Amazon - however when he arrived I was very disappointed to find that he no longer had the scabbard& and just a silver sword attached to his hand.  As this was the main attraction I just couldn't keep him and had to return him.  The manufacturer says they have made slight changes - WHY - and why has the picture not been updated?  This toy is fine if you haven't seen the first version& but hey& hark at me& a grown woman - I should have better things to think about& ha!!!!  P.S.  I see the picture has now been updated!"
7643,2391,5," I love this puppet. It really develops the creativity of children. They imagine story for hours and it is well made and resistant. Really nice"
7644,2391,5," Bought this hand puppet for my nephews 5th birthday.He really enjoyedplaying with it&was really easy to use very educational for role play."
7645,2391,4," I bought this puppet around a year ago to go with the Tellatale Hand Puppet Theatre and ShopIt's had a fair bit of use by my daughters. Both of my daughters seem to enjoy anexaggerated 'speak like a pirate' accent (and so do I) and this is just the job.It's still in a very good serviceable condition& the only sign of wear is the pirate'shook.  It's made of two layers of silver coloured textile (glued together)"
7646,2391,5," This is a lovely idea and went down a storm with the kids& great for putting on a show and making up funny pirate voices. Helps to illustrate the tale and bring a story to life and engages with the children so you have their attention. The puppet itself is a bit smaller than I had imagined it would be and not ideal if you have a big hand but it's well made with no detachable parts which is reassuring. I would be a little careful with his cutlass so to speak as you might poke someone's eye out if you got over excited but well worth the money& a great buy and a lot of fun whatever your age."
7647,2391,5," An excellent puppet. Perfect quality& built with enjoyment and humour in mind. Easy to manipulate by an adult or by a child. Now in stores though throughout the uk."
7648,2391,5," Wow! This is such good value for money. My 5 year old son was given it from father Christmas and loved it. Not seen anything like it before. Perfect."
7649,2391,5," This pirate puppet is made from good quality material.The colours are very bright and it is well stiched together. We have it for over a year now-Im late reviewing it-and it is still in the condition we got it. It was a present for a 4 year old boy. It has some nice features ie the 'wooden leg' and the 'hook' for a hand. It is easy to use. It is possible to move the pirates hand and head."
7650,2392,4," Was good use for prop although mouth doesn't open as willingly as hoped"
7651,2393,5," What a fantastic puppet for my dragon-loving daughter. Bought for her 4th birthday and has been loved and played with ever since& so we bought the huge green one as well as this huge red one.They go everywhere with her and people always comment how fantastic they are. Morgan and Morgana the dragons have had many hands making their heads move and snap and have made lots of children laugh! Morgana the red one can really make children believe that she is alive with their hand inside and she is huge! It is a fabulous toy for fantasy and role play and sits on the bed with six other dragons and a unicorn& knights and princesses. They are naughty at bedtime and act out stories every night with all the other toys! It is a beautifully - made puppet with lovely red material and golden claws and horns.The green eyes are beautiful. It is one of the best toys that you can buy for a child in my opinion& you can really have a lot of fantasy and fun!"
7652,2393,4," This large-size dragon puppet from The Puppet Company is a really attractive piece of equipment. The dragon is slightly - but not excessively - fierce-looking& so not too scary for using with children& and is beautifully made from red fabric with gold detailing.My only criticism of this puppet is that& unlike others I have bought from the same manufacturer& only the mouth of the puppet is manipulated by adult hand/arm movement (you put your hand into a slit at the back of the dragon's head& rather than inserting it up through the dragon's body). You are& thus& left with the dragon's weight being supported by just your hand. Since he is a large and well-padded beast he can get quite heavy.Ideal as a prop for re-enacting Julia Donaldson'sRoom on the Broom"
7653,2393,5," I bought this puppet as my school was having a dragon week. I hardly saw it during the week as the puppet was constantly being |borrowed| by staff and children. The pupils absolutely loved it - everyone wanted to know where I got it from. yes it is quite pricey but you get what you pay for and the quality of this puppet is superb."
7654,2393,5," Bought a few puppets & two of which we are returning with the same company as they were not quite what we were looking for ( prompt approval of the returns& thank you ) .  This Dragon was an absolute hit with our 4 and 1 year old& great either as a standalone prop or as an accompaniment to one of many stories that feature a dragon.  This particular one will have employment chasing the witch during the |room on a broom| for the foreseeable future !"
7655,2393,3," My review will not be as informative as i bought this for my brother& he loved it!it was plush and true to size from pic etc....however i didn't know it had a metal rod to move the arm.to sum up it is great and of good quality."
7656,2393,5," Our new addition to our martial arts club is called Scarlett and she is our new mascot appearing at lots of events! She is a beautiful red dragon from the Puppet Company. Everyone loves her and she is pure dragon perfection from her golden horns to her scarlet and gold tail. Stunning green eyes and a great dragon smile! I cannot recommend this fantastic dragon highly enough!"
7657,2393,5," The reaction from the children was wonderful but I myself love it (big kid). Been using this in the classroom for behaviour management and works a treat. Arrived promptly."
7658,2394,5," Got this for our 11 year old son who has some learning difficulties.He has always wanted a puppet or two.So we got him this and the crocodile.He loves role play and these puppets are great for imaginative play.They are better than i expected for the price& great detail and durability.These are well loved toys and are taken everywhere !"
7659,2394,4," I use this puppet to teach English to french children aged 4 to 8 years old.  I love it and they love it too. I use in conjunction with the white girl and they get up to mischievious tricks together.  It would be ideal if the mouth parts were a little easier to use (the natural resting position is |open|) as it's quite difficult to open and close.  The arms and hands are not really operational as you need most of your fingers and thumb to operate the mouth.  This is the biggest drawback because it would have helped me if the puppets could touch things& point etc.  Still ... for the money they are good puppets.  NOT toooooo robust actually.  The little girl's dress started to come apart the first time I used it and they're not washable. In spite of these drawbacks I still think that compared to other puppets they are quite good value. Maybe next time I will invest in something a bit more expensive& but I wanted to be sure I could use a puppet in an educational setting to good advantage before spending a lot of money."
7660,2394,5," This was a well made puppet just as described but I would have liked it to have been bigger which was probably my fault for not taking more notice of the size given. The puppet arrive 3 days after I had ordered it which was quite impressive. Will definitly use this company again for future puppets."
7661,2394,4," My 2 year old son was not so keen on the puppet when first introduced. It is now a favourite and he has lots of fun listening to it telling stories.  It is very good value and is very durable considering all the hair pulling and throwing about!"
7662,2394,4," i bought this item for use in a reception classroom& i have used it on many occasions and the children enjoy having the puppet. The puppet is child friendly as it is just the right size for the children to use as well."
7663,2394,4," It's a small puppet for a small price. He has a great head with a mouth that moves up and down. The body has no stuffing in it so he doesn't sit up. The shoes are stuffed for weight. I have more expensive puppets and will chose them in future if I buy anymore& but this little boy is a nice pocket money price puppet for a small child. If he had more expressions to his mouth he would be better& and some stuffing in his body to sit him up but he's only cost Â£20& so he's as described& and as expected for his price tag. No complaints. My son doesn't mind him& and wanted to keep him& but doesn't choose him as his first choice in a family of puppets we have.To sum up if you want a small& low priced puppet that's comfortable and soft to use& this boy may be for you."
7664,2394,5," My pupils love them. I have both boy and girl puppets  They are ideal for presenting new language&showing how French children meet and greet one another. The pupils use them to act out little scenes . The shyest child will speak through a puppet."
7665,2394,5," Characterful little chap I bought for one of my twin grand-daughters - a little girl for her sister - which she loves. Easy for little hands to work and they gave us an hilarious puppet show at Christmas. Excellent firt puppet."
7666,2395,5," These are lovely& well-made and very high quality puppets.  The main body is a very thick& long-'fur' fabric (which can shed a little in its first few uses) and the feet and beak are made from brushed nylon.This large-size (approx 40cm long excluding tail) puppet can be used by young children& teenagers or even adults and a 'baby bird' version is available purely for children.  I have large hands and long arms but still find them comfortable to use.  The large beak is very easy to operate and& unlike some other puppets which force the operator to move both the upper and lower beak/jaw& it is easy and comfortable to move only the lower beak.  This is a much more natural and realistic movement than raising the upper beak for the bird to 'speak' or squawk.  The squawker inside the mouth is surprisingly loud and makes a fairly realistic bird-squawk sound rather than a typical squeaker-squeak.  The puppets have different squawks so can 'communicate' together in a variety of tones and pitches but the squarks can also be removed& if preferred.I use these puppets to make entertainment videos for a mostly adult audience& including a special needs group of adults.  I've found that adults with a sense of humour seem to appreciate them just as much as children of all ages from toddlers to pre-teens.  They're very versatile& great fun and I think they offer exceptional value for money considering their quality.  I have nearly the full range of these birds and I generally operate them in pairs with them interacting together for performances.A very good buy and great fun too& limited only by your own or your child's creativity and imagination."
7667,2395,5," Purchased as a toy for my grandson who likes to dress up as a pirate. Larger than I expected but very happy with my purchase. Item is well made and tough. Whist being a toy it could be used in a play or production. Quality item."
7668,2395,5," i bought this to entertain the grandchildren as well as my young nephews. Lots of fun& good quality toy and good value for money."
7669,2395,5," A Great Low tech toy - good for imaginative play& and all ages seem to enjoy it.  The squeaker in the beak was a bit irritating at first& but when I saw the amount of fun the kids had with it (and other puppets& we have a few others) I got used to it.  Lovely bright colours& well made& and hours of play& so thumbs up all around!."
7670,2395,5," my daughter loves it because she loves birds and her friend has 2 differant bird hand puppets but she cut out the squeeker because it is a bit annoying me and her dad."
7671,2396,5," I've been very impressed with the quality of this range of puppets - which is not conveyed by the photos. This polar bear is very well made from a very soft& thick and high quality plush fabric and is surprisingly life-like with good features& particularly his claws!Although targetted at children he can also be used by adults - my hand is 19cm long and I can use it comfortably with a thumb and finger fingers inserted into the paws and two fingers operating the mouth.This polar bear by The Puppet Company will not disappoint an adult or child looking to have a bit of fun!"
7672,2396,4," Bought to use with puppy dog.  Allows you to protect your wrist/arm. Toy is beautifully finished with lovely detail.  Perhaps a little dear for this use but I am happy with my purchase"
7673,2396,5," The mouth is hard to operate& but then again& I'm not an expert. :o)The fur is very smooth and soft& I can only recommend it. Fits an adult's hand easily."
7674,2396,5," size and build quality are excellent - very well made item - even the mouth opens - would recommend this item"
7675,2396,5," Really good quality and fantastic delivery time"
7676,2397,5," Hey& this was a good surprise. I have bought this for my young son and it is a great size (did worry after reading the comment). Don't understand how it would need to be any bigger as it wouldn't be any good as a puppet. Quality is great and is very soft& colour is strong and vibrant& the characters face and mouth movement is funny. Can't wait until he opens it on Christmas day. I would consider this a great gift and if you want to have a lot of sill fun with your kid& then get one!!"
7677,2397,5," The Spender Family:Mum:  Sensible Sue  Great for young children to snuggle up in and play withDad:  Thrifty Tom  A dressing gown would be betterSon:  Shopaholic Steve For kids innit! An adult star wars one would be cool thoughDaughter:  Crafty Katie  Good for making a cushion or glove puppet out of itGrandma:  Budget Brenda  You could buy a larger throw or blanket cheaperGrandad:  Practical Pete  Not very big and could slide off when walking aboutDog:  Deefer  I'll sneak that in my doggie basket when they've gone to bed"
7678,2397,5," Brought as a present for my nephew& all my kids have one in fact I have brought for all my friends kids and my other nieces and nephews and they go down a treat. Would highly recommend as they come in a variety of funny colourful characters including a few Disney versions."
7679,2397,3," Glad I got this on offer otherwise I'd have been disappointed paying full price for it& it's a blanket with a puppet head& think my little boy will be fed up of it very quickly"
7680,2397,4," Great for small children& blanket not massive so might be to small for larger children. Mine are 6 and 3 and it is fab for them!"
7681,2397,3," Was a little over priced I could of got the same one for Â£5.99"
7682,2397,5," So soft and cuddly my 2 year old grandaughter loves it."
7683,2398,4," Very thick and fluffy toy for the small price tag. My wee boy really enjoys it& and he can use it as a cuddly toy too."
7684,2399,4," I love this versatile puppet. The large monkey hides inside the palm leaf nest while each of the |Five Little Monkeys| can jump out of the nest with its own banana. Oh& there's a toucan too!! A nicely constructed toy and good value for money which I would recommend to entertainers& educationalists and environmentalists alike. Not for the very young though due to the small parts."
7685,2399,5," This was bought for a present for our 2 year old son.  He loves it and we love playing with it for him!  The baby monkeys are finger puppets.  Its a great toy and quite versatile.  Would buy this as a gift without much hesitation!"
7686,2399,5," Great puppet for group fun with small or large groups of children the kids love it as do the adults"
7687,2399,5," Love the company's products as have bought the rabbit in the cabbage also and they went down a treat. Really well sewn together and withstand a lot of pulling and snatching. Bright colours with adorable expressions."
7688,2400,5," I've been very impressed with the quality of this range of puppets - which is not conveyed by the photos. They are very well made from a very thick and high quality plush fabric and are surprisingly life-like with good features.Although targetted at children they can also be used by adults - my hand is 19cm long and I can use it comfortably with a thumb and finger fingers inserted into the paws and two fingers operating the mouth.This range by The Puppet Company will not disappoint an adult or child looking to have a bit of fun!"
7689,2400,5," I made the aquaintance& through my elder brother& of |wolfie| during the Christmas period. The wolf is actually well made and quite lifelike. An adult's hand can manage to move his front legs& mouth and ears  with a bit of practice. My eight year old niece thought he was absolutely wonderful and was amused by his antics for quite a while...so much so that she wanted one too.From what I could see he was good value for money."
7690,2400,4," I think wolves are great and just had this crazy moment and ordered a wolf hand puppet on a whim. It arrived in good time and overall the quality is good and it appears to be quite robust. Well he survived an assault by my German Shepherd who tried to pull off an ear. Its also larger than expected meaning even my hand fits easily.The fur has a nice feel to it& and the colour from behind almost looks real. I even managed to convince a friend over a web cam that I had found a wolf puppy. Her remarks are not printable here& but needless to say& she thought it was real. What can I say& there are no written rules that say we have to grow up!Seriously though& it appears to be easily cleanable and as I said the quality is good. Furthermore& and something important to me is that there is no child labour involved in the manufacture. I would however say that this is not suitable for very young children unless supervised and not suitable for pets.Overall I'm very happy with this purchase."
7691,2400,5," Excellent product which has kept the young at heart and my younger relatives busy.  Very expressive features in the puppet - which incidentally looks like a wolf - with a hard wearing character. Very happy with this purchase."
7692,2400,4," This product seems very good quality and the 2year old I bought it for loves it. This said& it is more grey/black in appearance& than the pic& and somehow looks less 'sweet' and more 'scary'& but recommend all the same."
7693,2400,4," Bought this for my 1 year old and she absolutely loves it! Looks more wolf-like in real life than in the photo so i was a little concerned that my daughter may find it a little frightening& but she doesn't as she's so young! The quality is really quite high considering the fairly low price - my only gripe being that you can feel the loose stuffing in the head& so best kept away from young children when not being closely supervised. Will prob buy more puppets from this company in future."
7694,2400,5," The picture makes it look cute and small.  In real life it is kind of scary and quite big.  I bought this to play with my cat& and was surprised when I opened the box and the puppet's head was bigger than my cat's!!  The cat was initially scared of it as well but now he appears to enjoy playing hide-and-seek with Wolf and chewing on the fur when I am done playing.I really can't believe the size and quality of this thing& and only for Â£12!!!  You can't go wrong here."
7695,2400,5," Our 4-year-old granddaughter loves role play& so we decided to buy her glove puppets for her birthday - this and the pig puppet. She was absolutely delighted with them& and what pleased us most was that we could wear them too& they're so roomy! Not only that& they're really well made and should last for ages. All in all& excellent value for money!My wife and I have no reservations in recommending this item to anyone else who's thinking of buying a glove puppet."
7696,2401,5," With effort& you can make Tort go back into his shell and out again& but all it takes to make my 15 month old fall over with laughter is move him very& very slowly about.Good quality - we love this set of puppets."
7697,2402,5," I have been using this puppet in schools where I work as part of an e-safety campaign - paralleling space with cyberspace. I call my puppet Yuri and kids of ages 4 - 7 just love him."
7698,2402,5," My kids at school love astronaut BOB.  what more can I say he's a star and they all love to hear from him"
7699,2403,4," A lovely gift for ny niece's 2nd birthday&  bought a wizard of oz book to go with it. I think it could be a little small when using on an adult hand. We have the peter pan& which I think is easier to hold."
7700,2403,5," Bought this to use with my puppet theatre in the class room and because our topic was the Wizard of Oz! They are really lovely and well made and the children loved using them."
7701,2403,5," a good set of puppets & small finger puppets for the characters and Doroth is the bigger puppet.My 7 yr old daughter and I are v pleased."
7702,2403,4," kids  at  my  school loved  it"
7703,2404,5," My dinosaur loving grandson will love this. Good quality for the price"
7704,2405,3," I grew up with this show and when I saw this I had to get it so that I could mess about and interact with my young daughter. Very speedy delivery. The quality of the puppet is very good& and the potential fun to be had was tantalising.To my dismay my hand didn't even fit past the neck& so I couldn't opperate the puppet in any way.Absolutely gutted! Beware this puppet is for small hands!!If you are fortunate enough to have small hands I don't want to know. Lol."
7705,2405,5," Well made using decent materials and slightly larger than you might think from the description. My 3 year old little girl believes the puppets are real when i put on a show and loves them & even asking questions to them about what they are doing. Excellent  learning tool for pre school and fun as well. Old school fun  for kids you cant duplicate with a games console"
7706,2405,5," A birthday present for my one year old nephew& who immediately giggled and gave Gobo a big hug/kiss/teething chew on the nose! I guess the 36 months recommended age is for children to use the puppet by themselves - but if you wait that long you'll be missing out on years of fun!"
7707,2405,5," My little girl is 2& I can't wait to see her face on Christmas Day when she sees this. She loves puppets. The fraggle rock is a  favourite children's tv programme of ours"
7708,2405,5," Lots of fun from the moment the bag was ripped off. Very well made and looks exactly like the original puppets :) I got Wembley and Red too so lots of fun ahead!"
7709,2406,4," Bought these as one of three Puppet Company puppets for my daughter's first birthday. She was thrilled when we got them out of the package and started playing with them straight away. Great for interaction and our three- and five-year old niece and nephew were equally excited to play with them when they came to stay so I think these will last a long time."
7710,2406,5," I brought this for my grandson who will be 10 months at Christmas. It is bigger than expected and very soft and cuddly& really good quality& well worth the money. I am waiting for the giraffe to be delivered and will look at the finger puppets as well as I am so impressed. Can't wait for Christmas!"
7711,2406,5," Bought this puppet for a 3yr old boy for Christmas and he loves it!! Plays with it a lot and has really helped him to chat more as he's always talking to it! I find all the puppets from the puppet company are very well made and durable. Thanks for yet another fab puppet!"
7712,2406,5," Wow! Really can have great fun and suitable for both Parents"
7713,2406,5," My daughter absolutely loves this puppet and takes it everywhere with her.  A bit expensive& but brilliant quality. Would recommend."
7714,2406,4," Reasonable quality... For a 1 year old`s birthday ... well his dad will play with it more I think. Any& the baby liked it .."
7715,2406,5," my baby loves it& it has a happy face and it's really soft to touch"
7716,2406,5," This is a great puppet& well designed& charming not too scary for young children and very reasonably priced. A hit!"
7717,2407,5," This was a birthday present to accompany the book |Oi Frog|. Quality was very good and he has given hours of amusement to my grandson."
7718,2407,5," A high quality puppet. Beautiful plush material. Use at school to help teach German. The kids love him!"
7719,2408,4," Up close this glove puppet is just fantastic. It really does look to have been lovingly designed. My little niece and nephew (almost 2 and 3 and a half) absolutely adored it.One criticism is that space in the head is a bit tight if you want to work the mouth but it loosens up."
7720,2408,5," These dragons are fantastic. I bought one each for my two boys 5 and 6 a red one and a green one& they have called them burnie and gurgle. They have great fun with role playing and interaction between the two dragons who both speak! Good to cuddle up to at night as well& very quickly became their best special friend!"
7721,2408,5," This toy has become the hit of the year in our house.It is a simple glove puppet& well designed and fun to use.At bed time my children (girl 6 and boy 4) make up stories about |funny dragon| and then get mummy or daddy to act them out with the dragon.The promise of playing with the dragon has them running up stairs to bed."
7722,2408,3," For the money I suppose I shouldn't expect much.  It had only been unwrapped a couple of hours and the stitching was already coming apart& even though my daughter had not even started playing with it yet.  The nostril stitching came off straight away& but as I said for a little over Â£10 you can't really complain."
7723,2408,4," Think the grown-ups enjoyed this more that the children to begin with but by the end of the afternoon it was going down the slide with the little darlings. Well made but a little awkward to get the index finger up into the head."
7724,2408,5," My 9 month old girl is mesmerised& fits perfectly and very expressionate in its features. Shininess in the chest and wings is certainly noticed by my daughter. So happy with it& I've ordered a second for a friends little one."
7725,2408,4," Nice and big& Friendly face. This is not a cuddly puppet& the cloth is soft& but it is attractive in other ways.I would recommend it for what it is for:"
7726,2408,5," Grandson has not seen it yet& but I am impressed.  he loves dragons and will 'scare' us all over Christmas!  have bought puppets from this company previously and was not disappointed."
7727,2409,5," I brought three of these Monster Puppets from The Puppet Company for two nephews and my niece last Christmas.As they live long distance from each other I gave it to them at New Year when the whole family all got together. They went down a storm& the two boys loved racing about chasing each other roaring loudly and giggling while my niece the older one of the three who had the bright pink monster joined in with grown up role play and created a story and character roles for each of them.Very interactive& creative and they seemed to encouraged them to use imagination through play.Both sets of parents were happy with my choice of gift and I would definitely buy more of these puppets again in the future."
7728,2409,5," Arthur is superb! He is huge and surprisingly expressive. He is a firm favourite of the children and has quickly become part of the family.Top Tip: The squeaker can be moved out of the way inside so that you can chose whether he makes a noise or not."
7729,2409,5," Bought this for my niece as she loves shows such as sesame Street and furchester hotel. Still too small to use it herself but she has tons of fun watching it and finds the squeak fascinating. Only downside is that my sister keeps moaning to me how she has to pick up purple fluff from her carpet when they play but I'm guessing that's because it's new and she wants a break from cleaning Haha ðŸ˜‚ Oh and also wasn't expecting the squeak to be so high pitched for a big purple monster& is all good though& made me laugh."
7730,2409,4," Daughter was delighted with the puppet and has had lots of fun !!! The only thing I could complaint about was the squeak it makes & it can be rather annoying when she is pressing it continuously."
7731,2409,5," My son loves his Monster puppet.  My boy is 14 and on the Autistic spectrum. He has named his puppet Bruce and they are good friends and quite a funny team together.  We love the squeak as well."
7732,2409,5," Fabulous puppet& excellent price and speedy delivery.  What more could you ask for?  My kids love theirs.  They even have a squeaker inside!"
7733,2409,5," My grand kids think the puppet is real and stand in awe of grandad who listens to every word the puppet says. Brilliant bit of foolery"
7734,2409,5," An excellent puppet - bought for our Airedale Terrier who just loves to shake it!!"
7735,2410,5," Bought this for my son as he's a big fan of dinosaurs.It looks very lifelike and is exellent for all dinosaur lovers."
7736,2410,3," My grandson loves this t.rex.  He's crazy about dinosaurs at 5 years of age.  He likes the fact that it can be taken apart and put together again.  I thought it was very small for the price though."
7737,2410,5," the dinosaur toy was quite a good a good toy and i quite licked it"
7738,2411,5," A very nice puzzle& it is just difficult enough  and well made and holds together solidly and realistically cat like."
7739,2412,5," These card sleeves are absolutely fantastic. I can't speak more highly of them. First thing is I ordered these  a few days ago from pokemonst and it has arrived 3 days before what amazon estimated the earliest delivery date so i am very impressed with the delivery time. The sleeves are themselves are also very high quality. The design on the back is done amazingly and you can't tell this from the picture but the blue lines are shiny giving it a great look. The sleeves are very good at protecting the cards and i don't see the cards or sleeves taking any damage any time soon. For anyone who wants to know the inside of the sleeves are a shiny silvery colour. I highly recommend these for any vanguard player as they have no flaws and i would rate them 10/10!"
7740,2412,5," I agree the quality of this product is fantastic and enjoyed playing with them 100 percent. I recommend these sleeves if you're a cardfighter.ðŸ‘ðŸ¼"
7741,2412,5," Amazing sleeves strong shiny and great looking fit the cards perfectly."
7742,2413,5," I play Star Wars x wing and this is perfect to see all the cards great price and I got a feeling I will be ordering another soon with so much x wing cards"
7743,2413,5," Holds FFG Star Wars miniature cards brilliantly"
7744,2413,5," This is a great product for storing my magic the gathering card collection. Just absolutly brill."
7745,2413,5," Perfect thanks"
7746,2413,5," Strong and stylish. Nothing to complain about at all&"
7747,2413,4," Bought this for my housemate and he loves it."
7748,2413,5," Excellent& quick delivery& as described A*"
7749,2414,5," Amazing 3d effect& much better than other 3d puzzles. The multivision glasses work a treat& the clarity is fantastic.Its the first puzzle the kids have completed all because they wanted to see the assembled puzzle it in 3d.At last some Matt hatter stuff is available& the kid's love it.!"
7750,2414,5," My son absolutely loved this puzzle and the 3D effect works so well. He had lots of fun making it& and even more fun looking at it afterwards& we have all tried it out at his insistence!"
7751,2414,5," Brilliant Puzzle...i love the 3D effect this has& and its bright and colorful too which really appeals to the  children"
7752,2415,5," Arrived promptly and is as described& would order again"
7753,2416,5," I love these pro's there the best"
7754,2416,5," Great product fast shipping"
7755,2416,5," Perfect"
7756,2416,5," ok"
7757,2417,4," I really liked building this but was disappointed because it didn't say that it was made out of foam core on the product description. Fun to build but the little pieces break and get everywhere."
7758,2417,4," Bought as a gift for someone who likes to build and display puzzles. Don't feel the above ratings were appropriate but friend was happy overall with product"
7759,2417,5," fun item for a dutch friends birthday gift& great idea and well recieved!"
7760,2417,4," comes in a box looks more expensive than it did"
7761,2417,5," great product& great price"
7762,2418,4," Was very good product but lost a star because on some of the sleeves in the middle won't open so we had to cut them open with a knife but still did the job."
7763,2418,5," I baught two packets. Brilliant quality. Fit in my folder perfectly.These have saved me having little bundles of my Artist Trading Cards knocking around and they fully prevent the edges getting damaged.5 stars& fab quality& I recommend the purchase."
7764,2418,5," Came waaaaay early than the estimated delivery date which is always good. These came in a A4 do not bend envelope and in very good condition nothing was ripped or crumpled. And they hold my PokÃ©mon Cards perfectly. Will definitely be ordering more soon! :)"
7765,2418,5," Excellent for art cards& strong durable"
7766,2418,4," Downside is they do seem to split at the side. Possibly I am a bit heavy handed. This is the only reason I have given them a 4* other than that they are great and I would buy again."
7767,2418,5," Arrived very quicklyFits perfectly into a ring binder folderProduct description is very accurateWould purchase again when it's required!"
7768,2418,5," Very pleased with these. They are strong& well made and durable. Great for protecting my growing sketch card collection."
7769,2418,4," Very pleased with my order& they arrived on time and my daughters swap cards fit just right."
7770,2419,4," Bought this seahorse as an ornament to put in a fishing net hanging on the wall. And for that it is great. Not sure how long it would keep a child occupied as it took a couple of minutes to put together but it is ok. It is as described so I got what I wanted and expected."
7771,2420,5," There is now quite a selection of Ravensburger 3D jigsaw puzzle models to choose from& and the quality gets better all the time. Some of the models that are based on real life buildings are great fun to put together& but don't offer that most basic of challenges that defines a good jigsaw - the need to scrutinise ever single piece because every piece is unique and will only match up with its neighbours. This house is not based on a real house & so the artist has been free to put in an incredible amount of variation and detail in terms of plants& outdoor furniture and window boxes. Each face of the house looks different& and with its red plastic roof it really stands out from a distance.If you're unfamiliar with Ravensburger 3D jigsaw puzzles& you may not realise that each of the jigsaw pieces is made from plastic& so it's very durable& and some of those plastic pieces have hinges so you can bend them to form the corner pieces. Each piece is numbered& so if you get stuck or are unsure you have made the right match& you always have the option to turn over the pieces and look.The only non-plastic piece is the cardboard base& but even this is good quality. Something new to this puzzle& which may well have come from feedback from customers of the earlier models& is the ability to clip the model firmly to the base using plastic studs& so it doesn't come off when you pick it up. The finished model is so sturdy& I decided to use it as a storage case for a few lightweight keepsakes.It also looks really good on a shelf alongside the Ravensburger Windmill 3D Puzzle (216 Pieces)."
7772,2420,3," my son loves this puzzle and hopefully will be looking for more"
7773,2420,2," This was a present for my jigsaw mad daughter-in-law. I thought it would give her a different challenge. Unfortunately she completed it in one hour. There was no challenge for her and I felt I'd wasted my money."
7774,2420,5," YesIt look wonderful on display at home"
7775,2420,4," fantastic puzzle detail very good"
7776,2420,5," very please with item"
7777,2420,5," Actually better than I expected. My kids have got a few 3D puzzles but this is really pretty"
7778,2420,5," Fab seller"
7779,2421,5," These are very good for someone who is looking to keep their deck in a good condition and make it look nicer. I would definitely suggest to anyone who is unsure about buying the product& that they should get it. Very quick delivery and a very good product. Glad I bought it!"
7780,2421,5," My son saw these and asked me to buy them for him.  Exactly what he was looking for. Got too many cards now and he now needs another box!"
7781,2421,3," Good box& excellent covers for the Yugioh cards - not really a 'toy' as such& but jolly useful and good quality."
7782,2421,5," Bought this for Yu-Gi-Oh! cards& they are exactly the right size and have protected the cards very well."
7783,2421,5," My son loves this. Perfect I guess. He collects stuff...he is impressed with it."
7784,2422,5," Bought this for my 5 year old and she has had hours of fun with it! Stores away neatly in the tin when not being played with to keep the pieces safe"
7785,2422,4," We bought this to challenge an 8 year old who solved it in minutes. Could it be made more challenging"
7786,2422,5," wife loved it"
7787,2422,5," Great!"
7788,2423,5," I used t play with these wen I was little n thought my dgtr shud experience it to as its for her Xmas present thank you"
7789,2424,5," I had these years ago and am looking for them for my son as I have happy memories. A challenge to older children and adults too - I loved mine and played with them for ages and I think I was in my teens!"
7790,2424,3," Children loved them (got 1 each). Problem was they were stepped on and broken within a week! Don't stand up to the rough play test."
7791,2424,5," This looks as if it will keep my grand-daughter happily occupied for quite some time - and it needs no batteries!"
7792,2425,5," This binder is a great product. Hold us to 160 cards (if you don't put multiple cards in one slot). Also& the sleeves to slide loading so you don't find your cards falling out. the binder also holds itself closed with the elastic strip attacked. The binder also allows you to put sleeved cards in (there is so much space& whether you're using yu-gi-oh& vanguard& pokemon or whatever). I would recommend this to anyone looking for a decent binder."
7793,2425,5," I have purchased two of these binders in order to store my Pokemon XY Base set and FlashFire set& i am also planning on expanding my collection with all of the currently released and upcoming Pokemon XY sets.- Pros -Very good amount of pages for a 4 slot binderSide loaded cards means they just dont fall outStrong thick elastic fibre band holds it together wellBecomes very solid once filled making it very sturdy- Cons -Slots are slightly to big even when cards are sleeved making them hard to centreOverall a great purchase for anyone looking to store there card sets however id suggest always sleeve your cards no matter what binder your using for your card sets."
7794,2425,4," Bought this to put my Xwing miniatures upgrade cards in (2 to a pocket). They fit fine& especially with covers on. My only complaint is that the cover is a bit flimsy. Would be nice of it was hard."
7795,2425,5," Fast delivery&excellent condition&protects the cards well.The elastic helps keep the binder sturdy and together.Brilliant product for the price"
7796,2426,5," Great product"
7797,2427,5," My 7"
7798,2428,5," great"
7799,2429,5," I have now assembled it. The result is better than expected. Looks OK as a display in my flat. It was not too difficult to do from the instructions that came with it."
7800,2429,5," such a good model because people think it a metal model not a cardboard covered design& looks impressive on the side."
7801,2429,5," Birthday present for my grandad was very pleased with it very good detail and the stand is very solid"
7802,2429,4," Immaculate item& packaged well and quickly dispatched. Thank you."
7803,2429,5," I am 66 years old have a brain Tumor but still managed to build the Flying Scotsman the build instructions were easy to follow and now looking forward to my next project from Cheatwell"
7804,2429,5," Bought as a present.great looking product when completed you would think it's a metal fully built scale model& not a puzzle"
7805,2429,5," Excellent kit. Fits together perfectly without glue.Once finished you would not think it was made of card."
7806,2429,5," Bought as gift - recipient delighted.  Looks like a working engine from 2m away :)"
7807,2430,5," the 5 year old it was bought for was totally delighted& doubly so when i managed to buy 4 for Â£12:99 on ebay!"
7808,2431,5," Bought this to distract myself from pulling my hair out and it works a treat! I haven't pulled in almost two days! Very addictive and discreet too."
7809,2431,4," My son has aspergers and finds it difficult to sit still. This toy was brilliant for keeping his hands active while sitting still.Would recommend this toy as a fiddler."
7810,2431,5," this is now my second purchase of one of these as bought originally for my son who has autistic traits&but i got addicted to this&simple idea but really works for adults and children alike who like to fiddle with something"
7811,2431,5," A great little toy for people who need a fidget. Help those with sensory needs by giving those fingers a good workout."
7812,2431,4," The Tangle Toy is a good size and fits in the hand nicely! It is very helpful and fun to bend into other shapes."
7813,2431,5," I bought this for my husband as a destresser - works wonders but spends it's time mainly in a knot on his desk!!"
7814,2431,5," I bought this as a gift for my Fiance who has social anxiety and can struggle to be in shops& crowds and in queues& I thought he could twiddle with it and twist it when he was struggling with the anxiety/panic.It helps! :) He takes it everywhere with him in his pocket to help him cope with situations that are hard for him and it helps him to remain calm. I recommend this for anyone who has Anxieties and would be helped by twiddling with something as a distraction from a situation or a person.I know this is really a childrens toy but there is an adult use for it.The Tangle Jr is well made& the plastic is strong and withstands a lot of twiddling! If you are thinking about buying one& I would say go for it!"
7815,2431,5," I love these things& sometimes I get a nervous twitch so my Dr recommended getting something to distract me and focus my energy on& and I'm not sure if it has had much of an effect but I am so easily amused I love it anyway :)"
7816,2432,5," this was a Christmas pressie and was asked for by the recipient&I think he liked it."
7817,2433,5," The best deck protectors around. Item arrived on time and as expected."
7818,2433,5," Lovely sleeves& really impressed with the quality of them"
7819,2434,5," Bought these for a yugioh deck. Fitted the cards perfectly. Very high quality sleeves and fast delivery. Would highly recommend these card sleeves."
7820,2434,5," These sleeves keep my YuGiOh cards well protected& I am defiantly buying again."
7821,2434,5," Fit perfectly for my yugioh cards - no wear n tear after months of use."
7822,2434,5," Excellent purchase and fits my Yu-Gi-Oh cards perfectly"
7823,2434,3," thought would be useful but my son didn't use it all"
7824,2434,5," Brilliant love the coulour"
7825,2435,5," Beautiful little vase. Didn't take long to put together as all the pieces are numbered but I still enjoyed the experience! The vase itself is made out of curved plastic jigsaw pieces which clip together seamlessly and inside is a black plastic beaker. You build the main body of the vase around the beaker base which has little grooves around it so it holds the first round of jigsaw pieces securely and they don't shift. Pattern on vase is beautiful too. I chose the white vase with the flowers and birds on it. Lovely gift or just a nice treat for yourself!"
7826,2435,5," The flower 3D vase fully met our expectations and the recipient of the present was thrilled.  I saw the vase at a National Trust house where beautiful ceramics were on display and a similar vase was on a table for the public to put together."
7827,2435,5," The vase is a present for a friend and is great&"
7828,2435,5," Brilliant gift. Great packaging& easy to build and makes a lovely vase that can be used.Bought for old ( 70"
7829,2435,5," not to hard&came out lovely&pleased."
7830,2435,5," I love the design and the beautiful details of a humming birds on the vase it is a very beautiful vase to build up it was fun to do I have enjoyed building 3d puzzle so much"
7831,2435,5," great birthday gift"
7832,2435,5," A lovely idea and a nice gift. You need patience and a steady hand but it is worth the effort"
7833,2436,5," i know thy are not the best sleeves out there& but thy are still relly good i whode say :)"
7834,2437,4," near indestructable and great to the touch initially but do get tacky after a while so will need a wipe."
7835,2437,5," loved it and it arrived very fast"
7836,2438,5," The model detail is excellent and the laser cut parts remove the pain of having to cut out each piece. You need reasonably good eyesight& and a steady hand to get the best out of the model& but the rewards for patience are well worth it."
7837,2438,5," My son is studying deign in college and he loved these !"
7838,2439,3," This arrived with no inserts to put the cards in& otherwise a good buy."
7839,2439,5," perfect Brill"
7840,2439,5," perfect"
7841,2440,5," Bought for 13 year daughter. Absolutely loves it. Sturdy & brightly coloured& flexible shapes which are clipped together to construct all manner of 3D shapes.In no time at all she'd mastered the technique and was designing bridges and handbags! Suitable for boys or girls. Only minor problem is that all printed material is in Japanese but plenty of images to help."
7842,2440,4," Really long shipping time from China but to be fair I was made aware of that when I ordered. My daughter loves it and has made some lovely models with it."
7843,2440,5," The item took a while to get here& but great product my daughter loves them!"
7844,2440,5," Brilliant& hours of fun."
7845,2440,5," Brilliant"
7846,2441,3," Bought this for my niece as she loves puzzles and animals& especially dolphins and we loved the picture& however the jigsaw is too complicated for children under ten. The picture on the box is not the same size as the picture on the puzzle and has information that covers the picture so that you cannot view the whole picture. The box is a good idea for keeping the puzzle in and the 3D effect is very good - best kept as a picture. It's an extremely difficult puzzle even for an adult."
7847,2441,5," This makes such a different gift for someone& i enjoyed doing it&just ordered the sharks design& a nice design to go on the fridge once finished."
7848,2441,5," Brilliant!! Although it was a bit tricky but kept my daughter busy for hours."
7849,2442,4," This I bought for one of my nephews in Germany. He really likes these 3D puzzles&and they do look good-when You manage to finish it&that is! I have never done one of these puzzles&but I can see their appeal.This one looks very pleasing to the eye&and I would recommend this to anyone who likes something special!"
7850,2442,5," this is so easy and fun& I had lots of fun playing with it& and now have it on show in my flat"
7851,2442,5," great"
7852,2443,5," just what I wanted to dis-play part of my Napoleon Bonaparte collection of bits and bobs.  Right size& right price& quick service& what more can one say.  I'm not one of your regular customers Amazon but please stay around for when I need you."
7853,2443,5," Really pleased& bought for someone who has a collection of old train tickets& just the right size& to store them in."
7854,2443,5," Does what you need it to and are thicker and less flimsy than other similar products available."
7855,2443,5," These are great for my Kpop photo cards& great size. Good quality for the price! Thanks :)"
7856,2443,5," Description is as stated they arrived earlier than expected and I will be buying again."
7857,2443,2," not too bad& quite poor quality though& rip if youre not very careful"
7858,2443,5," Arrived quick and are just as described.They protect cards well.m"
7859,2444,5," Love it! Ordered as a present and was very well received! Good packaging and quick delivery."
7860,2444,5," Great productGreat customer service"
7861,2444,5," Arrived really quickly and looks so cool!"
7862,2445,5," I can't say I've owned many cubes& this being the second one I've received& the first one was a mirror cube which was cheaper than a portion of chips. This cube is very well built& spins easily& but not so easy that it won't sit flush or go out of alignment. It has great aesthetics being transparent with a smokey black tint& this allows you to see the screws that hold it together inside which is kind of cool. I still can't solve the damn thing but I love fiddling with it. 5 stars as I'm very happy with it!"
7863,2445,5," Prompt dispatch and fast delivery by the seller& very impressive. The cube was purchased to add to my collection and an initial cheaper buy of a similar looking cube Im looking to get. So tbh I wasn't expecting much however the cube itself surpassed expectations. Nice size for me personally& moves well and has tension screws. It's a nice cube and better than expected"
7864,2445,5," V5-Space is so neat and compact and an excellent stocking filler.  Well pleased."
7865,2446,5," I bought these for my deck of Yugioh cards and they fit perfectly. The cards are really snug and the pack comes with 60 sleeves altogether which is more than enough for the average sized deck. The colour is vibrant on the back& and the front is clear and not prone to smudging or other grubby finger marks.The only complaint I know some people might have with this product& is that it gives the deck some form of inflation. Air seems to cause the cards and sleeves to rise& drastically increasing the size of the deck& but this is only a minor concern as they do a great job of protecting the cards.Would definitely recommend& although be sure to check for the other colours as well."
7866,2446,5," Very happy with this purchase. Didn't have to wait long. They go perfectly with my Yu-Gi-Oh cards. I'd recommend to anyone looking for good card sleeves& look no further :)"
7867,2446,4," The fit isn't quite as snug as the official YuGiOh card sleeves but they are close enough to make them good value. Better than some others I have seen so would buy again."
7868,2446,5," Perfect for Yu-Gi-Oh cards& and the feel of the sleeves is great! Makes shuffling easy to do and cards don't stick to each other."
7869,2446,5," Fit perfectly for my yugioh cards - no wear n tear after months of use."
7870,2447,3," Not enough stickers but Ok as a small gift for a child who loves Frozen"
7871,2447,1," Rip off! Only a few stickers& very disappointed."
7872,2447,5," Perfect present.  Arrived very quickly!  Thanks!"
7873,2447,4," My little girl loved this at christmas"
7874,2448,5," These were recommended for my teenage daughter who suffers from anxiety and depression. She has found them to be very effective."
7875,2448,5," These are ace. Really nice to play with all 3 together. Exelkent fidget tots and stocking fillers."
7876,2448,5," Perfect stress busters and callers for stressed teens!"
7877,2448,5," Very helpful for my adhd son thank you"
7878,2448,5," Keeps little hands busy. Perfect!"
7879,2449,5," We no longer have match attacks& Moshi monsters and slam attack cards all over the floor. 50 goes a long way& worth every penny"
7880,2449,2," Picture is misleading pocket pages are ok but didn't received sleeves!"
7881,2449,5," does the job ! Good price"
7882,2450,5," Product arrived quicker than expected& which in most cases is best! The card sleeves fit perfectly over my Yu-Gi-Oh cards. The transparency is perfectly clear and the sleekness of them make it easier to shuffle the deck without worry of damaging/scuffing your cards. |You get what you pay for| would be a misstatement as for a small price& you get high quality& guaranteed protection for your cards. It's not often you get high quality for a small price."
7883,2450,5," As described. They protect the cards I bought this for. My son is happy as they are the right side for the Yu Gi Oh Cards."
7884,2450,5," This card protectors are the beat i would high recommended them for your yugioh cards the protect them well ðŸ˜ƒ"
7885,2450,5," These card sleeves fit Yugioh cards perfectly and keep the cards protected. Very good quality."
7886,2450,5," good exactly what is described but I read it wrong and thought it was a small book."
7887,2450,5," Fit perfectly for my yugioh cards - no wear n tear after months of use."
7888,2451,5," 3D puzzles are amazing. My daughter loves this and really enjoys putting it together and taking it apart. It is so simple and easy to follow the numbering."
7889,2452,4," Well suited to playing card and dice games. I got it mainly for One Night Ultimate Werewolf and was satisfied on that front too.Just roll it up and store in its box when finished& it would be nice if it were thicker but that's a small niggle.Good value for money."
7890,2453,5," Fun puzzle"
7891,2454,5," Great idea for my sons cards to keep then good. Great value . Fast delivery . Thank you ."

7897,2456,5," Keeping my pokemon cards in tip top shape."
7898,2457,4," Good fun& quite challenging and befuddled many of our family over xmas - as with any puzzle& once you know the solution there is no longer a challenge but it was really fun while it lasted!Build quality is great& it withstood being dropped& poked and even being thrown across the room by one frustrated child :)"
7899,2458,5," great product and a great designwas easy to build :)I would recommend this to anyone that likes this building design and architecture."
7900,2458,5," Enjoyable and easy to assemble. End productions very pleasant to view."
7901,2459,5," These sleeves are just amazing. They honestly feel so much nicer than the plastic versions. The matte is a great look& and it also makes the cards much easier to shuffle as the pure plastic ones tend to stick a lot more. It's a bit annoying to have to buy 2 packs for 1 60 card deck& but then again I needed the extras anyway :P"
7902,2459,5," Perfect for Pokemon cards.  Great sleeves& incredibly easy to shuffle cards in these.  Great purchase.  One or two per pack were not 100%.  I would recommend."
7903,2459,5," Great idea for my sons cards to keep then good. Great value . Fast delivery . Thank you ."
7904,2459,5," Fast delivery and fits the cards like a charm. (Magic the gathering)"
7905,2460,5," The kids loved it."
7906,2460,5," Brilliant"
7907,2460,5," Fab"
7908,2461,5," Have bought these before and are excellent quality"
7909,2461,5," I use these sleeves for my aceo art prints and originals for shipping.  They're well made and don't break the bank either. No qualms here."
7910,2461,5," Great."
7911,2462,5," I've bought these sleeves several times& they are great quality& good price& just the job for protecting postcards and photographs. Will definitely be back for more!"
7912,2462,5," Very good and easy to handle very good for my photos I am very pleased with these"
7913,2462,4," This was not what I wanted& as they are really too flimsy for the purpose I use them for& storing cutting dies. Having said that if I need any more I will contact the supplier to see if they do anything sturdier"
7914,2462,4," good"
7915,2462,3," Good"
7916,2463,5," Nice present. Looks completed. Will keep us entertained"
7917,2463,4," great for a xmas present"

7919,2464,5," Make and use it&That is such a beautiful idea.The quality of the product is outstanding&And made the perfect gift for my puzzle mad nan.I will definitely being ordering the other designs from this seller&Excellent service."
7920,2464,5," I have enjoyed building the vase up it is very beautiful vase of a Chinese dragon and I do like Chinese stuff"
7921,2464,5," really lovely puzzle and a real vase to use at end love the challenge"
7922,2464,5," It is a beatyfull item"
7923,2465,5," Amazing sensory toy& it stinks of petrol& but it's bearable & speedy delivery"
7924,2466,5," These are REALLY nice card sleeves. My lad got into Yu-Gi-Oh! recently and so I figured I'd get into it so I understood what on earth it was all about. Having spent a small fortune on the cards themselves& I noticed card sleeves in use in a tutorial video on YouTube& so I figured I'd do my best to keep these pricy cards in nice condition and get some sleeves.I bought some budget ones as my lad didn't want the patterned ones& but I liked the look of these and went for 3 packs to ensure I had plenty AND to get the free postage.They fit the Yu-Gi-Oh! cards perfectly and the Double Dragon image on the back of each sleeve has a lovely metallic sheen to it. The look great! As these are Konami branded sleeves I don't think you're going to get much better.They are good value and I can see that if I'm not careful I'm going to find my cards in the cheapo plain sleeves and my lads cards in these& sooner or later. However you can get slightly better value sleeves if you're on a budget. I bought these for my lad& and they are not bad at all. Ultra Pro White Deck Protectors. YuGiOh Size. (60)"
7925,2466,5," The sleeves are very good quality the card fit easyThe price was reasonable delivery quick nice jobthat is all"
7926,2466,4," These are really cool sleeves and do a great job of protecting your cards but don't bring them to a yugioh tournament because the advisers there at the competition will say you can't because of the distracting design but for just fun playing around there great."
7927,2466,5," My boys are pleased. Very nice quality& extreme value for money and resourceful. Keeps cards in perfect condition or prevents further wear."
7928,2466,5," Fit my Yu-Gi-Oh cards perfectly& protecting them from scratches and other damage."
7929,2467,5," We thought we were buying a 16 piece Clown fish and a 64 piece one arrives.  Havent done it yet.The puzzle bugs is very nice but the lid where you do it has bugs already on it - its very distracting - in fact it is awful.  We do it opn a table and then put it on the lid.  We already had a puzzle and the lid was plain to be able to do it on.We wouldn't buy anymore magna puzzles so please stop sending us emails about thems - we live in New Zealand and it is too expensive to send them back.CheersBlackmur Family"
7930,2467,4," Nice challenge!"
7931,2468,5," Excellent enjoyed making it very much easy to make"
7932,2468,5," Looks fab when built"
7933,2468,4," Very good puzzle will look amazing When finished."
7934,2468,4," Great puzzle my daughter was chuiffed"
7935,2469,5," Perfect gift for our great granddaughter!"
7936,2470,5," Bought these for my 7 year old son& who absolutely loves football.  He was thrilled to get this large pack of collectible cards.  Price-wise& these are very good value and therefore I'd recommend these over the small packs."
7937,2470,4," My son loves match attax and was really excited to receive the 'swap tin' as a Christmas present."
7938,2470,3," I thought it was a bigger tin but not"
7939,2471,5," Product arrived promptly& good quality and fits my 60-card deck of MTG including sleeves. The combined price for the box and sleeves is good seeing as some individual packs of 100 of these particular sleeves can cost as much as this set! Also& the sleeves feel and look really nice if you have a best deck (although for large sets of extra cards it would be better to get a cheaper alternative). All in all I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to protect their prized cards while also making them loom and feel good."
7940,2471,4," To begin with& the sleeves are excellent - they have very little& if any& stick between them. It's also easy to insert cards& along with removing them. If I had to nitpick about them& I would say that they are a bit pointy on the corners& but that leads to only a mild annoyance. The deck box is clearly high quality upon handling it& however as I've used it a lot& putting decks in and taking decks out& I've become fairly concerned about the hinge on the back being damaged. The box& however& does hold plenty of cards& 100 sleeved I've managed to get in& perfect for holding an EDH/Commander sleeved decks. I'm sure it could fit many more unsleeved. As for the size of the sleeves and the box& all cards fit in them but they are designed for standard sized cards& like MTG or PokÃ©mon cards& rather than Yu-Gi-Oh! cards."
7941,2471,5," I ordered two of these recently along with some extra deck protectors for my Magic cards. Whilst the box arrived promptly I was rather dissapointed to find that they had sent me the clear version rather than the black ones. I contacted the seller immediatly and they got back to me within hours. The problem was soon rectified after some very dedicated help from customer support. They even let me keep the ones they had accidently sent me as compensation. Wonderfull customer service and I would definatly order from them again."
7942,2471,5," My son was very happy with his boxes he went straight to his room and sorted his decks out. Thanks it arrived in plenty of time too."
7943,2471,4," It's all of decent quality and everything is quite rugged& no complaints. There's not a whole lot else to say really."
7944,2471,5," not bad for the price arrived on time great for duels keeping them cards safe from grease and sweat (and food)"
7945,2471,5," These are great quality card protectors.  They look good and are easy to shuffle and play with.  It little bit pricey& but ultimately worthwhile.  The deck box is a bit on the cheap side& but it does the job.  I mostly get this deal as it's cheaper than buying two packs of these sleeves separately and you get a cheap deck box thrown in for good measure."
7946,2471,5," This is exactly what I have been looking for. The box is a perfect size for a 60 card deck& and a sideboard of 15 (and a little more). The sleeves have an excellent feel to them& and I highly recommend the matte over the plastic covers as the matte just feels so much better& and makes it slightly easier for shuffling. Overall a great product."
7947,2472,5," What a fantastic puzzle game. Suited both adults and children from approx 5"
7948,2473,5," Unlike the addition and subtraction books& in the series& this is a great book to use with KS2 children (perhaps older ones& since all the mosaics use a wide coverage of the x tables).It also provides a good way of practising co-ordinates.Excellent value for money& with 30 different multiplication mosaics& and 5 division designs."
7949,2474,4," Have bought other Smart Games IQ Travel Puzzles and this one is quite challenging. Really like the fact that these puzzles are compact& could just be tucked into a pocket and could be played any where."
7950,2474,5," Just love smart games and so does my 6 year old son. Very stimulating& does not get boring&  gets them thinking and very compact so can take it anywhere! Have been buying lots as presents!"
7951,2474,5," loved and used by everyone"
7952,2474,5," Brilliant little game."
7953,2475,4," great product& very quick postage"
7954,2476,5," Love it took a time to work it out but not impossible"
7955,2476,5," Bought for a friend who 3 weeks on still hasn't solved it :)I tried it too and I love the quality of materials used in this range but also the precision and attention to detail shown in every Hanayama CAST puzzle :)"
7956,2476,4," Very pleased with this product so much I kept it for myself it was supposed to be a gift not any more:-)."
7957,2477,5," Love this puzzle and the response it stimulates from patients! Highly recommended way to spend time with a loved one who suffers from Alzheimers."
7958,2478,5," I bought these for Party Bags for my 4 year olds birthday party. The toys were exactly as I expected and they brought smiles to my son's guests' faces!"
7959,2478,5," Great party favors lots of choice. Suit boys or girls. Arrived quickly too. Well priced."
7960,2478,5," Fast Delivery. Product as stated. Would Recommend. Thanks a lot!"
7961,2479,5," Lots of fun. Brilliant"
7962,2480,4," I love this game - very entertaining and brain challenging. You have to follow some clues in order to put the 9 coloured-shapped pieces on a board. Instructions could be much clearer though& as some clues leave too much room for interpretation..."
7963,2480,4," We found this game great& very stimulating. The think that could be improved would be to have a magnetic board so that you don't have to necessarily to play on a table or flat surface. Furthermore& it would be great to have a travel version!"
7964,2480,5," I had been waiting for this game while it was unavailable and the wait was totally worth it. You don't even need instructions& you learn the rules as you play along from the very easy patterns on. Highly recommended."
7965,2481,5," An old friend of mine& a blacksmith called Bob made me one just like this in 1976&Ive missed laid it somewhere during many house moves& saw this one had to buy it 39yrs later I still remember how to do it& Buy and enjoy"
7966,2481,4," As said on the tin.... A brain teaser!  Good instructions included& the metal is a bit tricky to manipulate."
7967,2481,4," It was exactly what i expected and it is good for concentration."
7968,2481,2," cheap looking product. all information in chinese"
7969,2482,5," Xmas present will keep somebody entertained for hours"
7970,2483,4," This is a fantastic product& although smaller than I was expecting& however it is very detailed and easy to use. My son looked at it and said 'urgh' a few times& but I know that it will prove to be very educational and very interesting to look at the inside workings of the human body. There are other such cubes in this range for example numbers& letters. I will most likely be buying others."
7971,2483,5," I bought 2 of these for my daughters& 1 wants to do medicine in September"
7972,2483,5," I liked it but child didn't find it that interesting. Maybe dye will in future. She has had these cubes before so not novel to her but children love tithe formatting they get to play with these whatever the subject matter."
7973,2483,4," Fun and educational. The children learn without realizing it. It is suitable for all age groups. No one is too old to find it interesting."
7974,2483,5," Very useful and clever ."
7975,2483,5," This is a great learning aid...my son loves it!  Small enough to take anywhere so no excuses regarding revising!"
7976,2483,5," Every home should have one of these& especially if you have children or grandchildren. Very educational."
7977,2483,5," Love it. Like how the information is split up. Interesting but the cube helps keep kids engaged"
7978,2484,5," Graet game"
7979,2485,5," Out of all the Hanayama puzzles this is my favourite. It is not the hardest but it such a wonderful piece of design. I just love it. First if all& it is quite small but weighty in your hand. The outer frame made of two interlocking dark pieces is only 3.5cm sqaure (and 1.5cm deep) and contained inside is a 2cm diameter silver coloured sphere which is also made in two halves and has a tennis ball type curly pattern on it. The sphere can move around freely 360 degrees and the frame pieces can twist around each other a little. Seems simple but when you stumble upon the solution after hours of fiddling and see the way it comes apart and the lovely unexpected nature of it& then you really can appreciate how clever it is. Until that point you get a very tactile puzzle which feels great in your hands with its smooth glossy finish but when you find the solution it's like an elegant magic trick that has made most of my friends go |ooh!|."
7980,2485,5," This is one of the better puzzles from Hanayama& great build quality& intriguing solution.  Took me a while to get it apart and I can't get it back together!!All part of the fun though."
7981,2485,5," I saw these Hanayama puzzles when hunting for Christmas present ideas for family members and ordered this one and the Donuts after searching for the best puzzles in this range. I thought the difficulty rating of 4 out of 6 sounded about right.The puzzle is smaller than I had expected for the price& however once you play with it I think it is worth the money. It is very sturdy and made of solid metal pieces that won't break or damage easily. My family and I spent a few hours puzzling over this. Initially it was very frustrating and hard to understand how they could possibly come apart. After many hours it suddenly came apart in my hands! I then could not put the pieces back together! It is just as much a puzzle figuring out how to put the 4 pieces back together as how to take them apart. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a seemingly simple puzzle that's tricky. It's a great gift idea.I have also played with& and completed& the Hanayama Donuts (my current favourite)& Elk and Baroque puzzles. I've enjoyed them all and will be ordering more for myself in this range."
7982,2485,5," My second Hanayama puzzle& the solution is slightly more difficult than the Donuts puzzle I bought first but the design is much more elegant& the mind that created this is a mind to envy.The design throws you down the wrong track from the off and& once arrived at& the true movement is sublime& it's not just the sense of pleasure at the thing finally coming apart but the simple mechanism is a pleasure to behold.The quality of casting is very good& packaging is very nice& if it's to given as a gift and it is simply wonderfully tactile& The precision of the design is really enjoyable& once you come upon the movement required it becomes very addictive.If you have any interest in problem solving and spacial thinking then buy yourself some Hanayama puzzles (or let your friends and family know that they've now have something they can get for that hard to buy for person in their life)."
7983,2485,5," This puzzle is amazing piece of art. It looks superb. Although it is not the hardest one (it was my first Hanayama puzzle and I've solved it in 3-4 hours) it still takes some time. And the pleasure you will feel when it finally unfolds... amazing!"
7984,2485,4," A nice& solid-feeling puzzle with a pleasant aesthetic. Unfortunately let down a bit by the solution& which is one move that it is entirely possible you'll just stumble upon."
7985,2485,5," I brought this for my 8 year old step son along with the ABC puzzle. Its incredibly well made. So far after 2 weeks only 1 person has figured it out and putting it back together is another puzzle in itself!Only thing i can say is when you first open it move the ball around a bit. Our 8 year old open the package and after 2 seconds got it apart. Hes convinced he master of the puzzles now as he did it so fast& i dont have the heart to tell him that is was probably set right  in the packaging......we will let him have that one"
7986,2485,4," If you take it apart yourself& it is easy and you see exactly how to assemble it back and for me this was very bad. Once you see it once you can redo the entire process in under a minute. If you want to do it though& once you see that it is moving close your eyes and move it until its pieces are separate or give it to someone to take it apart for you. If you have the pieces& assemble it is very tricky and worth the difficulty level. It looks nice also with a nice shape."
7987,2486,4," frustrating for me but a great gift"
7988,2487,5," Bought for son& thoroughly enjoyed doing them on christmas day"
7989,2488,5," Super fast delivery& excellent cube& very smooth movement. A++++"
7990,2488,3," Seems okay& has yet to be used to full effect it is a present."
7991,2488,5," Son loves it"
7992,2488,5," fab!"
7993,2489,5," I bought this for my 4 year old and she loves it. So does my 8 year old. The younger one sometimes does the puzzles but she likes to play with the wooden pieces as well. She can do the puzzles herself and can tell if it is correct or not without being told. She just changes it so it is right. The older one has done most of the puzzles but he still likes playing with it as the pieces are so tactile. It also helps his dyspraxia.Would definitely recommend. Even if your child is a bit young yet they can still play with the pieces. The fact that it encourages them to sort it out themselves makes them work more logically.This was a bargain. I have lots of the SMART Games - and I love them all."
7994,2489,5," very good quality toy& lots of challenges to work through. Some easy& some tricky. The challenges get harder as you work through the book. its a great learning toy& I would say for 4 years and over. My 5 year old loves it."
7995,2489,5," This has been a real hit with my 1& 4 and 7 year old& not forgetting the adults. Great to have a game that the children aren't dependent on an adult to supervise all the time but can play together as well if desired."
7996,2489,5," Brilliant!"
7997,2490,5," Already had one of these games here at my house& which my 4 year old great nephew absolutely loves& so bought him one for his birthday!"
7998,2491,5," My 10 year old niece loved this present. It was one of the cheapest she received& but she hasn't stopped playing with it."
7999,2491,4," Daughter loves it. I can't see how it can hold her attention for long but apparently it is lots of fun."
8000,2491,5," I am so glad...."
8001,2492,2," Bought 6 as kids party bag presents& 1 piece fell off within a day& so far I know of 2 that have completely broken (it's been less than a week since the party of 9 year olds left my house!) The kids liked them but I expected better quality for the price paid."
8002,2492,5," Love it& take everywhere I have it hanging on my handbag keeps me and the kids amused whilst killing time. I remember having one of these as a child"
8003,2492,5," kids loved these - put them straight onto their book bags and are continuously twisting and turning them!!!  worth the money!"
8004,2493,5," Another of the Hanayama's |Marine| series.This puzzle is quite strange. Part of solving it is to work out how to go about solving it!However& as with all the |Marine| cast puzzles in this series& it does not take that long to figure out.Hard-core solvers will probably be very dismissive of this type of puzzle.Which is a shame& because I think what makes it great is the beauty of the design combined with its intriguing value.A good quality product."
8005,2494,5," A perfect game to have in the bag to provide to a bored child (age 4+) or adult alike! It has a great black box that opens and closes easily as well as keeping the pieces nicely tightly in it. The pieces are of very good quality& and since they are of different colours& a child can easily learn a pattern of arranged pieces that worked before& helping him or her get started with the next attempt at completing the puzzle again. Both my 4 1/2 year old twin sons have been able to complete the puzzle& one with more ease than the other - interestingly& the one who usually succeeds at completing card board puzzles is the one who has found this puzzle more challenging. I took a photo of the completed game when it arrived& and every time we complete a new arrangement of the pieces& we take a photo - the kids love having their completed challenge being photographed!"
8006,2494,5," Bought for my 13 year old daughter& this puzzle has provided many hours of fun for the whole family. Good value& durable and timeless"
8007,2494,5," Love it very challenging would recommend to everyone& my 3 year old loves it! I just can't believe there's 40+ ways to solve it!"
8008,2494,5," Super puzzle for ages 6 to 90. Lots of possiblities but a good brain teaser. My kids have played with one for years on and off."
8009,2494,4," This is a lovely little puzzle& good quality case and pieces& delivery was on time. Suitable level to challenge my five year old. The only inconvenience is that the case doesn't shut unless you have completed the puzzle& and when I'm clearing up the toys before bedtime I am not inclined to sit and solve it before I put it away!"
8010,2494,5," Great stocking filler. Was quite difficult to solve but my son-in-law managed it twice. TIP: Unless you solve it you can't get all the pieces back un the case to close it"
8011,2494,5," Really great puzzle.  I bought it for my 6 year old nephew but think it's a bit old for him at the moment.  However& it's kept the whole family occupied for hours from my 11 year old niece& teenage nephews and Mum and Dad.  It looks relatively simple but is actually quite challenging."
8012,2494,4," I had no idea what size this would be& but its fine. Handy pocket size& so it's easy to take anywhere. I haven't found an alternative way of completing it. YET!"
8013,2495,5," Great cube. It turns very well and this 4x4 is fun to solve. You will be elated at how good this cube is. Best 4x4 I have owned by far."
8014,2495,5," Absolutely great puzzle. Came in one day with standard delivery which is amazing. Definately recommend."
8015,2496,5," Not as hard as some of the others in the same category& however did take some time to get this one in pieces... I like the fact there is more challenge to this puzzle& you can re-assemble it into several different patterns for more hours of fun :-)"
8016,2496,5," very teasing& a good item"
8017,2496,5," Looks a good toy& chunky& nice looking present"
8018,2497,5," Me and My two girls had fun putting it to gether first time.. I think they rebuilt it a few time since then.. so they are very pleased with it.. design is great and very well made"
8019,2498,5," Grandson loves this.  Great purchase"
8020,2499,1," This is a very cheap cube and the quality is what you might expect for such a low price.Upon opening the package I could feel that the cube had a very loose feel to it& this would have caused the cube to come apart during normal use& so I set about tightening it up - quite an easy job& you just pop off the centre cap on each side and tighten the screw beneath it) This improved the feel of the cube and I set about having a play with it& after a few mins I could feel the edge of a couple of stickers catching on my fingers and when I checked several of the gold coloured stickers were peeling away at the edges. None of the stickers have come off yet& but I have only played with it for 10-15mins& I don't think they will last for more than an hour's actual play time.Solving the cube is harder than with a normal 3x3x3 cube as all the colours are the same and you have to figure out which shapes go where& if you don't mind the build quality then it will be entertaining and make you think in a different way that the normal cubes.Overall a neat cube which has been let down by it's build quality."
8021,2499,4," It was a gift for my partner. He loved it a lot... The only thing was the gold plates were easily peeled and scratched... also there was a clicking noise when he turns it in a certain way... Other than that& it's a perfect way to lose track of the whole day!"
8022,2499,5," Mmm well i am 40 and can do the rubicks cube inabout 10 min everytime ok not a speeder but still if.........look trust me stop reading and buy both the mirror and the gold version you not regret it& i had to wake the wife up when i got mine i wa so happy how it works when you have the nack to mix it up which is hard to start with you can really start to scratch your head& i have a autistic 2 year old with a 10 minute this is intresting span and then throw it and she loves playing with them (prefers the silver mirror one) and will then give it me to put it right& so yeah trust us both and buy both you will love them no cube set is done without these i would add a mixed up photo for you but that would spoil it im sure."
8023,2499,5," The product itself is of decent quality& better than I expected for the low price so I'm very happy in that respect. Movement is good& alignment relatively easy with only a bit more care needed with positioning. The shape of the blocks makes the standard moves seem less familiar but the internal mechanism appears to be solid.The puzzle itself is a very nice extension to the standard 3x3x3 cube. The completely asymmetrical nature of the blocks means that you're challenged in a different way compared to the normal colours which are easy to spot.Recommended for anyone who has the standard 3x3x3 cube sorted and wants something slightly different."
8024,2499,5," One grandchild collects these&  another for the collection& he loved it & plays with several all day long if allowed"
8025,2499,5," Damn tricky& but totally brillient puzzle. It turns and all that smoothly without any problems. I've been playing with it every day since I got it and the stickers havn't budged& all in all a very good piece.Compared to the rubiks cube& this one is all gold rather than coloured tiles& which makes it extra tricky& as this time it's all about the sizes and shapes of the pieces rather than where the coloured tile is."
8026,2499,5," the puzzle is very smooth and it is challenging to solve base on size rather than colour. I love it."
8027,2499,5," It's very eye catching. Once into it's cube people do ask how you can do it if it's all the same colour and then impressed how it changes form once turned!My son loves things that gives him attention and this does the trick! It's a great novelty cube that gives hours of fun."
8028,2500,5," Wonderful to do and beautiful when completed. Good quality pieces and true-to-life depiction of scenery. The finished picture was really large and we were all impressed."
8029,2500,5," A gift for my mother.Kept her busy for a while!!!It is large& so make sure your table is big enough"
8030,2500,5," An absoute gem.One of the best jigsaws we have had."
8031,2500,5," Simply beautiful!"
8032,2501,5," great sat for hours trying to do it but had to cheat in the end looking up video for it as there are no instructions but love it all the same"
8033,2501,5," Taking it apart is not easy in the first place. Just wait till you try re-assembling it! I have done it so it can be done but expect it to take time as it will certainly keep you occupied not to be attempted if you are in a hurry or have a hot date imminent!!!"
8034,2501,2," Looks really good and at first sight made a great present. However when it came to using the puzzle it broke in several places during disassembly prior to fist use - very disappointing"
8035,2501,5," Bought as a stocking filler for my grown-up son. He loves puzzles like this and it kept him occupied for a great deal longer than many similar games would. Very well made and robust."
8036,2501,4," This will fit in the palm of your hand and is fairly expensive for the price. That being the case it does what it says on the tin and overall I believe was a good buy."
8037,2501,4," took me roughly 10 to 15 minutes of my time& sourly disappointed& although i must say superb quality wood and very hard to brake wood& all in all good for kids"
8038,2501,4," Great stocking filler& only issue my partner solved it within a minute. Tip&  don't buy this for engineers... it doesn't work! Otherwise great product."
8039,2501,3," Good little puzzle& quick postage but pretty expensive for what it is. Nothing we haven't seen before& just a rehash of the same old puzzles sadly."
8040,2502,4," This cube is a good quality. I have used it for a couple of months& the children also play with it. I am slightly worried that some stickers may peal off if we are not careful (that is the reason it is four& and not five stars)& but& overall& the quality is there."
8041,2502,5," Very good quality& and good service as well. 100% recomended. The product was at time expected. My husband have been used a lot and it's still working perfectly."
8042,2502,5," I originally bought this cube at Argos.  At Argos& the packaging is slightly different - it comes in a see-through box - and it was slightly more expensive.  However& the cube has now died after fairly heavy use (one of the inner joints snapped)& hence the need for a replacement.The cube comes with a fairly thin |How To| guide which is not particulary easy to follow. The best |How To| Rubik's cube tutorial I have found is by a Swedish guy called Lars Petrus. (I don't think Amazon will let me give a website on this review but it is easy to find).  It has extremely clear animations that you can work through interactively and at your own pace and which show you exactly which move you need to make.  If you are new to the Rubik's Cube& I think you would need at least an hour to read through the explanations and to solve it& but after that your times would rapidly come down. My best time is around 90 seconds which impresses small children& but much slower than the world record which is a truly mind-boggling 10 seconds.My only problem with this particular cube is that some of the stickers came off fairly quickly and the red ones faded (and obviously it snapped with my attempts at high-speed cubing after about 6 months).  However& the same complaints are made of the |original| Rubik's Cube Company cube. Hence I have only awarded 3 for durability.This cube was fairly stiff to turn at the start. It can be lubricated simply by getting a normal graphite pencil and drawing on the all the black inner parts of the cube& then rotating it forwards and backwards.  The graphite should help reduce friction between the inner surfaces.  This not only makes it quicker for solving but also easier for children to turn.Read more â€º"
8043,2502,4," Well received this today"
8044,2502,4," Finally& A Rubik's cube that works and moves properly. Its a bit more expensive than some of the others but they are all cheap and difficult to move. BUY THIS ONE.Not perfect& but could be an awful lot worse."
8045,2502,4," This is the best quality cube I've ever hade. The stickers are durable& the rotation is very clearly& even with one hand. Some cubes have mechanical difficulties& you should have the right angle with less tolerance to rotate a column& but this cube is very easy to rotate even the colums and rows are not at the same angle."
8046,2502,2," The quality was surprisingly poor& the stickers are peeling off at the corners within a couple of weeks of use. I suppose the plus side is that it is easier to cheat now. I think Mr Rubik would be disappointed."
8047,2502,3," My 7 year old son has been fascinated by the Rubik's Cube since seeing his friends with them at school.  He begged for one and so we bought this one.  It is of a reasonable standard& but the stickers are beginning to peel at the edges after only a small amount of use.  The turning mechanism appears OK at the moment.  Not sure I would purchase another one of these - would like to see them make one without stickers& just coloured plastic that would be more durable"
8048,2503,3," This is a lot smaller than I was expecting and looking at the back of the packaging I think it's giving hints on how they are completed& I hope my nephew does not notice this as it was something I wanted to buy him as a fun challenge for him to complete."
8049,2503,5," perfect for inquisitive fidgety children"
8050,2503,4," Jolly good entertainment for everyone!"
8051,2504,5," Clap you hands and  the lamp turns on& clap again and lamp is brighter& clap again and it turns off. Assembled it takes up little room& just a bit bigger than a large orange. Easy to assemble but note all instructions are in German. Lovely reminder of a nice film."

8053,2505,5," 2nd famous five jigsaw purchased. Love the concept of these puzzles.Keeps them entertained."
8054,2505,5," Good"
8055,2506,4," We were recommended this toy and are very happy with it. It is good to have a variety of toys& and although it is similar to rush hour in a way& nevertheless kids had fun with it. It looks easy at the beginning but gets harder. The pieces are strong& so overall it is educational& makes them think& and has nothing to do with killing& shooting& guns or computer arcade games& so we prefer these kind of items in our house!"
8056,2506,5," This comes from a stable of great games. You cannot go far wrong with this. The whole family thought that this would be easy. Ho& ho& ho& how wrong we all were. They get harder and in fact& all three of us cannot do the last two puzzles! Video games or this?& give me this any time."
8057,2506,5," I bought this for my dad for Fathers day as he loves a puzzle and he is having a great time moving up the levels.  He is looking forward to becoming a 'master' of the game.  We've all had a go and it is good fun."
8058,2506,4," I bought this for my 8 year old granddaughter and it seems she loves it& working her way through the early levels quite quickly with a little help from Dad&  Well recommended."
8059,2506,5," BUY THIS!  Kept us all busy at Christmas.  Looks nothing in the box but tests your brain.  The whole family got involved so much so that we had to set up a challenge.  Will be buying this for other people.  I got it for a twelve year old but would also really recommend it for older teenagers/young adults who are very competitive!"
8060,2506,5," This is an excellent brainteaser with levels to suit all the family. Easy to take on holiday as it packs into a small bag. The pieces are wonderfully tactile and it is quite addictive to move them around the board."
8061,2506,5," Great mind-puzzle for all the family - even competitive Dads!!! Works from easy levels& build up your skills and strategies as you go. Brilliant fun and challenging. Just like me..."
8062,2506,5," Perfect for children from ages 6 and above AND adults!! I love the fabric bag it comes with& for easy storage when travelling. Super quality as well."
8063,2507,4," As a cube lover& I like this little cube for speedy solving in competion with friends"
8064,2507,4," I really like this cube. It is fairly easy to solve if you are good at solving a 3x3x3& and it moves very nicely (although it sometimes locks if you turn it sharply). I prefer the normal colours though - this cube's orange is very bright and at a glance quite similar to the red."
8065,2507,5," Entertaining and frustrating at the same - great fun and kids love it"
8066,2507,5," This is a very good& loose cube& which is very quick and easy to manage! It is a little creaky and doesn't always cut at 45 but still by far the best 2x2x2 I've used."
8067,2507,5," Super smooth quick action. Hardy solid construction."
8068,2507,5," Lovely smooth and nice to use. Grandson is having fun with it - and we did& it takes us back years ago. Sturdy not like some we have had. This is nicely made."
8069,2507,5," Ordered 28th November and arrived on 7th Dec& 2 days before the earliest date...nice item& feels good and very smooth.Cheers!!!"
8070,2507,5," Having tried all manner of 2x2 cubes (east sheen& v-cube& lanlan etc) this cube is really solidly built& good quality and very fast& corners accurately and allows some nice cuts. It has reduced my personal best... Very impressed."

8073,2508,5," I really like these jigsaws as there is no picture guide& you need to read the story and work out the picture from there. You are basically solving a mystery.  My daughter is 7 and managed it with help from me over a couple of hours the first time but has since managed it several times by herself.  There are several stories and I have them all."
8074,2508,5," good purchase and prompt delivery"
8075,2508,5," brilliant"
8076,2509,4," This is my third Hanayama& and I thought I'd figured out how to disassemble this quite quickly& but it turns out there's more aligning required at each step than you would expect.  Be assured& like the others you do not need to apply force at any time& it slides apart effortlessly when it is aligned& but hovers temptingly close when you're not quite there due to the many degrees of freedom.  The only downside of this is that even with practice it takes time& so you'll not be able to amaze people by taking it apart in seconds like you can with others such as the marble puzzle.  Like the other puzzles& this one feels very nice in your hands& and is solidly built and attractive."
8077,2509,5," A thing of beauty& it took me about 2 hours to undo this and another 30 minutes to get it back together. Something to use as a paperweight to draw people in..."
8078,2509,5," superb puzzle.  quite fiddly& small& but it is made very well.  the hardness rating is 4/6& it deserves higher.  now happy to own 6 hanayama`s& this is my fav along with hanayama rattle."
8079,2509,5," I bought this for a family member at Christmas. When I got it through the post I was surprised how small it was but it looked very nice. I was intrigued about how such a simple little thing could supposedly take more than a few minutes to solve. Over Christmas me and 3 other family members spent ages fiddling with it and getting frustrated! It was very satisfying when it finally came apart... and then came the challenge of putting it back together! Once put back together it was still challenging trying to understand exactly how it worked.It's very well made and I think it would be incredibly hard to break/damage it as it's made of solid pieces of metal. This provided quite a few hours of entertainment and led me to order more in this puzzle range (Marble - also given as a present& Elk and Baroque). This one is my favourite in the Hanayama range so far - I've already ordered another one to give as a Birthday present!"
8080,2509,4," This is one of the harder Hanayamas I've tried. I've had it a few days and haven't solved it yet& though I feel I'm making progress. It's a little awkward to manipulate& given the smooth surfaces and the narrow cracks you need to slide a fingernail into& so I don't spend long at a time on it.The design is exquisite. Even if you don't want to play with it& it'll look beautiful on your desk. The interlocking |donuts| aren't black and white& as the picture seems to show& but two slightly different shades of silver. The difference between them is barely noticeable. The puzzle is weighty and has a lovely feel in the hand.Update: I'm not sure I really solved it& it just sort of came apart of its own volition. As another reviewer noted& it gets looser the more you play with it& which may affect its durability."
8081,2509,5," Arrived within the time stated & nicely packaged and in a nice box .This is a well made & all metal object . It is & as stated by others & a little smaller than I expected . The metal |doughnuts | are 1. 5 inches wide (4 cm) but any bigger and they would be quite heavy !!!It is not an easy puzzle to solve&  but harrdly impossible . And it helps if you dont bite your fingernails to the quick !!!Once you realise the trick & its very easy to reassemble but still fiddly t take apart .It is a good conversation piece ... Take it apart before your guests arrive and watch as they struggle to put it together !!!A well engineered & beautifully made puzzle . Maybe a little expensive for what it is & but gives a lot of pleasure . Recommended ."
8082,2509,5," I purchased this as a bit of after lunch entertainment for Boxing Day with the family. It foxed us all for several hours& until I finally cracked it. However getting it back together is equally hard!I would recommend this for young adults up (say around 12). It is quite tricky and needs some dexterity to solve& but it is very satisfying when you do.For those not family with these puzzles& they aren't huge& but are well made& nicely finished and feel like quality gifts. It feels heavy in the hand and doesn't have any sharp edges or unsightly moulding flaws.Overall an excellent small gift or stocking filler to entertain the determined puzzle solver."
8083,2509,4," It's a brilliant& tantalizing& tactile puzzle. I've only managed to get it half undone so far& so not trivial.It doesn't include the solution& so no temptation to cheat&"
8084,2510,4," Looked old& a bit tired& better recipes and menu could have been chosen!"
8085,2511,4," granddaughter really enjoyed doing this jigsaw"
8086,2512,4," If you were to spot the ways this puzzle moves& then just randomly performing those movements will lead to a solution in not much time& which is a bit of a shame for a level 5 puzzle. It is an extremely solid item& no fragile parts to get snapped off in frustration (so a bonus if you're attempting to keep children quiet with it)."
8087,2512,4," Don't cheat& this puzzle is loads of fun and after having solved it a few times already& I still enjoy fiddling with it. It is mesmerizing to see the parts rotate and spin within themselves& and there is only 1 way the piece may fit to properly disassemble ( I said too much! DOH!)Hanayama doesn't dissapoint with their high-level puzzles that are beautiful& sturdy (got to love the heavy cast iron pieces)& and definitely get those synapses in the brain going. This one is stayin on my desk and I will soon be onto the next one!"
8088,2512,5," One of the best Hanayama puzzles. Feels so nice and solid to hold and beautiful feel as you attempt to solve it."
8089,2512,5," This is my first Hanayama cast puzzle. Very well made and I just love that polished metal finish.Very intriguing sequence of movements. I have taken it apart and  then& after an hour or so managed to re assemble it. Whew!!!I would thoroughly recommend this manufacturer& and top marks to whoever invented it. Truly amazing puzzle with a nice heavy feel to it"
8090,2513,4," incredibly fast& lightweight& rarely pops and it is now my main after earning my pb time and average on this cube. from 33.74 seconds to 26.29 seconds. highly recommend it to anyone who is good at cubing and wants to speed cube. HIGHLY RECOMEND"
8091,2513,5," The cube is exactly what i expected& it turns smoothly and comes perfectly adjusted& there is no need for lubing or adjusting the tensions. The only problem though is that it took an extra week to arrive. Besides the timing& it is perfect."
8092,2513,5," I'm not an expert on cubes& but it certainly turns a lot better than the old Rubik's brand cube I've had ever since the early 80's& but that's not surprising given the age of the latter.  I'm perfectly satisfied with it& anyway& and my cubing is improving& but still can't get below a minute and a half& so if you want an expert opinion& better read someone else's review."
8093,2513,5," When this cube came it was pre lubed and was very smooth. After getting used to it for a couple if weeks or so& I was able to cut down my average time from around 35 seconds (with Rubiks brand cube) to 20-24 seconds. The cube is very good quality and the stickers are also very durable. I have also got my personal best of 17.724 with this cube."
8094,2513,5," This is my second one. The first one from a different make broke after an hour of playing. It was impossible to fix it.  After looking around in Amazon and reading the other reviews& I gave this one a try and I am not disappointing at all. It is well made& speedy& I would definately recommend it."
8095,2513,5," I was a little worried about this cube as it had stickers and I expected them to peel off after a while but it has been fine. The cube has had a lot of use by children and has been dropped and is still in great shape."
8096,2513,5," Crazy fast and smooth.Highly recommend."
8097,2513,5," Best cube I've have owned& turned smooth and fast straight from the box no need for any lubricant& it also cuts corners with ease.For this price you can't go wrong."
8098,2514,5," Fantastic game& bought this for my 5 y/o& but adults are getting as much pleasure as kids from this."
8099,2514,5," stashed for christmas"
8100,2515,4," I love puzzles& especially these type. This one looks difficult& there are 2 horseshoes either end with chain between them and a ring over the chain. The idea is that you try to remove the ring& which is too small to pass over the horseshoes. It seems impossible& but very careful manipulation of the shoes and chain will make the ring come off easily& then revers it to put the ring back on. Great fun but fairly easy to do."
8101,2515,4," I like it. I cant seem to do it very easily and its certainly a fun thing to pass around and give everyone a task. I got it for my girlfriend for a stocking filler and she loved it!"
8102,2515,5," Very well made& looks impossible to do when you first look at it&but as they say it's easy when you know how"
8103,2515,3," a bit too easy& even the kids figured it out in just a few minutes. a bit disappointing really. shame"
8104,2516,5," its very good bright  and for all ages"
8105,2517,4," Really great to get my 6 year old boy thinking& although one of the shapes has already cracked due to being dropped. Would recommend if your a parent who like to keep you and your child's mind active."
8106,2517,4," Really good great memory and hand eye co ordination we love it and to make it more interesting we set a timer to see who's the fastest"
8107,2517,5," Good one!!!"
8108,2518,5," I thought this toy might be one of those that is played with on Christmas day and then never picked up again.  It looked like it might be too easy a challenge& but it wasn't.  My 8 year old grandson loved it."
8109,2518,2," unlike the other reviewers me and my family were not at all taken with this game.it was boring&ball bearing often got stuck n there just wasn't any excitement factor&hence since Christmas no one has played with it. further& it does not look as good as i thought it would and it is too pricey for what you get. just not for me and mine i am afraid."
8110,2518,5," Brilliant present for a six year old boy.This kept him amused for ages - especially good for the car as it's not bulky and he was quite happy to concentrate for ages trying to complete the maze.Would definitely recommend this!"
8111,2518,5," If you like the Addictaball you'll like this too. Great entertainment for adults"
8112,2518,5," My 7 year old enjoyed this game. It's good fun trying to get around the maze& it even times you so you can play against yourself"
8113,2519,4," Rush Hour is a brilliant game!  My children love playing it and I love playing it.  It does what it says on the box - makes you think& is fun and everybody can play.As a primary teacher I have used Rush Hour (standard version) to teach problem solving to 8-11 year olds (using the different levels of challenge cards depending on their ability).  Although Rush Hour is advertised as a single player game& I have watched 4 children trying to solve the more difficult challenges together.In my opinion& the 'deluxe edition' only deserves 3 stars for durability and 4 stars overall for several reasons.  Unlike the standard game& this edition doesn't have a carry bag or a drawer in the traffic grid to store the cards.  Instead& the cards are stored in a playing cards box (which could rip easily) underneath the grid.  The red car's metallic paint chips easily and like the grid& all vehicles are firmly wedged in their own little spaces (far too difficult for little fingers to get out).The deluxe edition comes with 20 more challenge cards than the standard version.  As the same 40 challenges in the standard version could be attempted time and time again& I think the additional cards in the deluxe edition are unnecessary.Brilliant game& shame about the 'deluxe' packaging.  Definitely not worth the extra Â£5.  Buy the superior& less expensive standard version of this game instead."
8114,2519,5," This a brilliant game for puzzle solvers but frustrating if you not in that category. I love it so bought this for a friend for Christmas she is totally addicted now."
8115,2519,5," A great game for all ages& the grandkids love it as much as us oldies.It gives hours of fun and is addictive. Am telling all my friends about it."
8116,2519,5," Fun& challenging game for all the family. Bought for my 7yr old daughter and it was the most played game on Chrisymas Day."
8117,2519,5," Excellent..... keeps the whole family challenged because of the different levels."
8118,2520,5," Another very well made wooden puzzle& this one is a little devil to solve but once there the achievement is well worth the wait."
8119,2521,5," Worked well at the Minion themed birthday party we had recently.  Arrived quickly."
8120,2521,4," I got this for my daughter's birthday.she thinks it's call."
8121,2521,5," This looked great up.  Was impressed with quick delivery"
8122,2521,5," Super fast delivery& good quality."
8123,2521,5," Really nice and good quality"
8124,2522,5," Nice item"
8125,2523,4," it looks lovely"
8126,2524,5," I left it a little late to order these from abroad...just one week from my little one's birthday.  But& they still arrived a couple of days before!  Really glad I got them as they looked great around the room and really added to the party.  Will be re-using them next year!"
8127,2524,5," lovely banners perfect if your child loves thomas the tank engine& you get 6 banners in the pack which is good for the money you pay for them."
8128,2524,5," this was so cheap that i wasnt expecting anything great but it beat all my expectations and my 2 year old loved seeing thomas everywhere"
8129,2524,5," I gave this 5 stars because everything was really good"
8130,2524,5," really good value for money - great birthday decorations& am very glad I bought these as they looked great around my house"
8131,2525,4," Such a bargain - my little niece loved this& much bigger that I thought it would be. A good buy : )"
8132,2525,1," it didn't work - but that's not Bieber's fault.  I do believe they are a no more than a fad and would not recommend wasting any time on them."
8133,2525,4," A lot slimmer than I expected& its more like a very thick cardboard& but worth the price I paid. Our niece was very happy with it."
8134,2526,5," great"
8135,2527,5," Arrived quickly& exactly what I wanted. Xxx"
8136,2528,5," Excellent toy for kids (and big kids). Great quality and easy to assemble (need plenty of floor space though). Fantastic price and customer service was exceptional as I had a few queries they sorted promptly."
8137,2528,5," Perfect item for my little Nephew shame about the delivery man didn't take as much care package was a bit battered!!"
8138,2528,4," it was great  thanks"
8139,2529,5," Good quality product and nice and large& it nearly filled my whole wall! Needless to say my son loved finding this on his birthday."
8140,2529,5," Great product arrive nice and quick an is very big in size it can be chopped into loads of banners worth every penny!"
8141,2529,5," fab son loved them"
8142,2530,5," Fantastic for occasion& quite long to able to cut it and stick it other places as well as one! Very happy!"
8143,2530,5," These where a lot wider than I thought they where going yo be they where fantastic !"
8144,2530,4," Banners very good size just gave 4 stars as one teared when splitting them"
8145,2530,5," Great value effective party decoration . Pleased with it."
8146,2530,5," Very nice printing and bright colours. Good size."
8147,2530,4," Received quickly& slightly smaller than expected"
8148,2531,5," These are lovely banners which arrived fast& great condition and will look brilliant when up for my daughter's birthday and will use again for my son's birthday as they are unisex banners which is perfect."
8149,2531,5," Nice Foiled Birthday Banners& colourful& made well& long& despatched quickly& packaged well& Great!!!"
8150,2531,4," Good buy"
8151,2532,5," Excellent quality and speedy delivery"
8152,2533,5," Really nice banners& great colours and sparkle. You get 3 repetitions of the same pattern so you can rip them up to spread about or have one long one banner. Nice mix of colours too if you don't want to be stuck with just pink as a theme. We matched with pink& purple and silver/white balloons."
8153,2533,5," Bright bubbly and glitzy banners. Will be able to use them again for my 60th birthday. lol."
8154,2533,5," Bought for a surprise 60th lovely bright banners did the job!"
8155,2533,3," Very pretty& but be carful as they do rip easily :/"
8156,2533,5," These were lovely& the colours were amazing"
8157,2533,3," looks well on wall and does the job fine"
8158,2533,5," Excellent addition to my Birthday party"

8169,2535,5," Thanks they were grand"
8170,2535,5," Great"
8171,2536,4," Fast Delivery& lovely item"
8172,2536,5," Arrived exactly how expected. Good quality. And great length to fit nicely on a wall. Although in made 2 desperate thins from it"
8173,2536,5," Fantastic item and as pictured - looked great on the walls and front door. Finished off the decorating nicely."
8174,2536,5," I got this ready for my son's 1st birthday in December. Looks good."
8175,2536,5," Cheap and cheerful sign. Great for my son's first birthday."
8176,2536,5," Great condition& fast delivery. Great thank you!!"
8177,2536,5," Excellant and good one. Delivered on time."
8178,2536,5," Quick delivery. Pleased with item. Thanks"
8179,2537,5," good value"
8180,2538,5," Ideal for our party"
8181,2539,5," Great banner& just as ordered."
8182,2539,5," Great"
8183,2540,3," I have not much to say here just that the banner was fixed to appropriate surfaces and served a purpose.It has been used once again but you do have to be careful when removing  as they split easily.I like the holographic ones as they do stand out& in my opinion anyway."
8184,2540,5," I don't think it says in the description but it's 2.8 metres and the banner can be separated into 3 banners. The quality is great& good print and looks great. Lovely soft colours& perfect for the baby shower I am throwing for my friend. Arrived quickly& very happy customer!"
8185,2540,5," Well packaged and banner was  strong enough to be used and then kept for future events."
8186,2540,4," Practically perfect& other background colour choices would make it 100%"
8187,2540,5," pleased with this"
8188,2541,5," this banner was very long and came in sections& which was good& and planted them all round the room and out in the front"
8189,2541,4," Just the job for my husbands party arrived quickly.  Had to retun 2 packs as I duplicated the order by mistake"
8190,2541,5," This will be part of a very nice birthday decorations for the coming birthday party for my sister next month."
8191,2541,4," was able to put it within a gazebo . re-useable so can't wait for the next member of our group to be 60."
8192,2541,5," really happy with this product was a good price and a good buy"
8193,2541,4," Ok& did the job well enough"
8194,2542,5," Good quality and excellent value for money.  The banner can be cut to any length - ideal for decorating both small and large areas.  Quick despatch.  Would recommend this product to others"
8195,2542,4," The banner was expected.  Good as you cannot usually get banners with 17 on.  Had delivery problems.  Seller not very helpful."
8196,2542,5," Arrived very quickly. Not opened yet but looks as described."
8197,2542,5," Arrived in good time"
8198,2543,4," This is really cute& looks adorable. Loses tune quite a lot& but maybe that's mostly due to it being new and the strings plastic."
8199,2543,5," great product!! Our daughter is really happy :)"
8200,2544,3," Didn't realise it was only the picks I was getting. Thought there was more in the pack then ordered. Think it is misleading on website& it says all under one listing and thought it was altogether. But probably more on my part. ThePicks are are good tho."
8201,2544,5," Very pleased with the napkins it's great having the happy birthday on them with the Hawaiian girls on as we are having a Hawaiian party for my sister in laws 60 b.day. very helpful when I needed help I received great service from them.i would recommend them."
8202,2544,5," Not your usual cocktail stick. Just what i needed for my tropical themed party.  Plastic fantastic but just the ticket."
8203,2544,4," good value for money& however they got very tangled. could only use them twice max. great for deco in house"
8204,2545,5," Great product and weather proof!! Stayed in perfect condition outside! Beautiful colours and very girly. Great party decorations Highly recommend product!"
8205,2545,3," These banners are very attractive banner however they are very delicate for children party& needs to be made from a stronger material."
8206,2545,5," The birthday girl loved it and it was long enough to be able to cut up and use in a few places"
8207,2545,5," Really pleased!  Strong enough to be kept for next 2nd birthday!"
8208,2545,5," Excellent product&arrived on time as promised by supplier.."
8209,2545,5," Pretty colours! Plastic rather than foil! Very nice!"
8210,2545,2," This banner is beautifully designed and perfect for a girls party however the material is so bad its only for single use. I used tape to put it up and when taking it down the tape stretched the banner and ripped it."
8211,2545,3," They were ok. Cheap quality though!"
8212,2546,5," This banner is great& good quality and was used for the party and also for a meal we did for the birthday girl& it is still intact and could be used again and again.  Highly recommended"
8213,2546,5," Very fast delivery& well packaged& these were great quality product and everyone thought they were really really good& they can also be reused at any time in the future."
8214,2546,5," The item was as described and good for the price. You need blue tac to fix it as it is thin foil. It was colourful and suited being fixed to flat surfaces."
8215,2546,5," Very pleased with this and quick postage.Its my mother in laws 90 birthday on 9th March and this will look good on the wall"
8216,2546,5," Good quality  banner seller posted it out before the delivery date for my dad's birthday thank you highly recommend"
8217,2546,5," Pretty good quality and value for money& could be used again if kids had not took them down and played with them"
8218,2546,4," Bought to decorate the house for my stepfather's 90th birthday.  Helped to make the day extra special for him."
8219,2546,5," This banner was long& cheerful& cheap& easy to stick up with blue-tack and my cousin loved it when she was 90"
8220,2547,5," It looked absultely amazing !!!!! Just needed alittle tape to keep it on."
8221,2547,5," It was bigger than I thought."
8222,2548,3," My Eldest is Buzz Lightyear mad just now so for his 3rd birthday we decided to use toystory as his party theme.  The banners are fine& just run of the mill banners& they did the job we required of them.  The fault would be that the picture indicates that the banners say 'Happy Birthday'& which is what we wanted& 'Time To Play' was the actual message printed on the banners.  Although as my son can't read yet it mattered not.  Arrived reasonably quickly& 3 days& even with the cheapest delivery charge."
8223,2548,1," This is not the same as shown in the picture. I ordered and received a |party time| banner not a happy birthday.  Disappointed as I now need to order another banner for my little boy."
8224,2548,5," I brought this banner for my boyfriend's birthday as he's obsessed with Toy Story! It's a lot bigger both width and length ways than I expected and stood up to a week hung on the wall. I've taken it down and folded it ready for use for next year so definitely good quality and does tear easily. I would definitely recommend if you have a big enough wall to hang it across. Really good value and quality for money. It arrived promptly took& earlier than expected so I didn't have to worry about it not being here on time."
8225,2548,2," Disappointing - opened package to find not Happy Birthday Banners but time to party not what i ordered."
8226,2548,2," My son loved the banners only thing was it didnt say happy birthday on it said time to play."
8227,2548,4," Long banner to go along a couple of walls or& as we did& cut into sections to decorate one wall& a bay window& front door etc.Banners will last well due to being foil rather than paper& there was a slight offset of the printing on ours& so up close was a bit blurry but looked fine up."
8228,2548,5," My grandson is toy story mad it was perfect for him"
8229,2548,1," It does not say Happy Birthday!"
8230,2549,5," made my hubby smile"
8231,2549,5," brilliant"
8232,2549,5," Very good"
8233,2550,5," Arrived in good time and well packaged.Large enough to make a great statement banner above my parents garage door!Stronge material& even managed to look good after several day of sub-zero temperatures â„ï¸ðŸ˜„"

8240,2550,5," Fitted nicely into rest of decorations - very good."
8241,2551,5," Perfect for the purpose it is to be used for. A village celebration for St Georges Day patron saint of England."
8242,2551,5," A cheap and cheerful banner which does the job.  If packed away carefully& with the individual flags kept flat& the banner should provide repeated use."

8269,2558,5," value for money"
8270,2559,5," This is NOT a toy& hence the 'I hate it' stars above. As a banner& EXCELLENT. Strong& a decent length and very bright and eye-catching. Delivered quickly and difficult to find in shops so I felt lucky to find it here and so much easier to have it delivered when we all seem to have such busy schedules."
8271,2559,5," These banners were ideal for decorating our lounge in order to celebrate friends' Golden Wedding and were very much ppreciated"
8272,2559,5," Couldn't find a 50th wedding anniversary banner in any shop so was delighted to finally find one online and price great"

8288,2563,5," Excellent item just what I wanted thank you."
8289,2564,4," pretty pink bunting& ideal for party or decorating a little girls bedroom. It is quite long and the polka dots look a good size on the pink background"
8290,2564,2," When this finally got delivered it had the pice of 60p printed on it& which was half the price I paid so I felt cheated. Looks like a very cheap product& will do if on a budget and don't mind looking like it. Wouldn't recommend."
8291,2564,4," Good value ordered a few pieces from this range haven't used it yet but am sure it will be fine for a birthday party"
8292,2564,5," Brought for Macmillan coffee morning. Look perfect. Good price and quick delivery."
8293,2564,4," The strings at the end were long enough for hanging well. The colour was bright and I like the white polka dots - they added some variety to the awesome yellow party my son insisted on. I only wish it was printed on both sides."
8294,2564,1," The service was actually very prompt and good but sadly the product was very disappointing. It looks very tacky in real life and really not as nice as it appears in the picture.  However the sending service was very prompt."
8295,2564,5," This matched perfectly with a Marks and Spencer polka dot cake ordered for my son's 21st birthday. It was delivered quickly and I bought other matching item too which were also great."
8296,2564,5," These are great for decorating a room for a party& longer than I expected aswell.Only down side is they are not patterned on both sides but thats only a minor issue."

8299,2565,5," Was very happy with this"
8300,2565,5," Really big.great"
8301,2565,5," Exactly as it says"
8302,2566,5," This was extra long and saved us having to buy too many banners for the function room."
8303,2566,5," Excellent value for money and fitted the big space I wanted to fill perfectly."
8304,2566,5," Good size& colourful& not good if you've got a specific colour scheme in place"
8305,2566,3," Quite flimsy decoration.  Don't expect to pack this away and re-use."
8306,2566,5," colourful banners just the job&very pleased"
8307,2566,5," Great item arrived quickly would recommend"
8308,2566,5," Good quality. Size and colours great."
8309,2566,5," as described! bright and colourful."
8310,2567,5," This guitar proved a hit with all the kids on xmas day& ages from 2-7 were quite happy to fight over the single guitar available& so caution in crowds& biggest downside its very hungry on batteries."
8311,2567,5," My four year old niece is mad about Doc McStuffin (I didn't even know what she was talking about) and she loves this& for the price it seems well built and loud......so may not be a hit with the parents! Great buy in my opinion& delivered safely and swiftly."
8312,2567,4," My granddaughter like this but got bored with just the four tunes... if you could make your own tunes it would be great..got this because she lives doc mcstuffins..."
8313,2567,4," This was a really good purchase& easy to play and lots of fun. My daughter loves this. It would get an excellent if it had actual strings."
8314,2567,5," nice guitar& fast delivery& thank you"
8315,2568,5," can't find many items for 10th birthday in shops so this was excellent! Bought other 10th birthday items through Amazon as well!"
8316,2568,5," nice banners at a good price& pretty long so l was able to cut them down a spread them all over the house"
8317,2568,5," Triplicate banners meant all prime spots were appropriately decorated for the big day"
8318,2568,3," Arrived within time scale. Banners narrower than expected but done the job."
8319,2568,5," Brilliant product. Did just what it said on the packet."
8320,2569,5," Well worth the buy"
8321,2569,5," Very fast delivery. Excellent"
8322,2570,4," Nice colours and strong balloons - Just don't blow them to big!Added a nice touch to my friends surprize baby shower."
8323,2570,5," They were used as part of display feature with plain contrasting white and blue with helium and weighted.  looked great!"
8324,2570,4," Wanted some balloons for baby party and found these& which fitted the job spot on. Great product and came in good time"
8325,2570,5," I liked these ballons they looked great. I did take them to a shop to get filled with helium the lady in the shop said they could not be filled to big as she did not think they were latex and sutible for helium. It does say on the pack they are suitable."
8326,2570,4," these balloons appear to be made of a nice thick material and whilst have yet to be inflated I am sure they will do the job perfectly. The writing matches the other items in the range and is well printed. overall very pleased with item."
8327,2570,3," Came within a few days& but I have blue and green in the pack& all while the order said blue. But can't complain as it's for a boy and green is still ok"
8328,2570,5," These were better than the other baloons we brought& the picture on them is really clear when blown up& not like some of the others we had brought."
8329,2570,5," These were as I expected & they are good quality and arrived promptly & unfortunately we haven't used them as my grandson was born prematurely ."
8330,2571,5," The item is well enough made so that it can be reused more than once. Colurful& fun and good value"
8331,2571,3," Originally& I received 'Happy Birthdya' and after writing to the seller& they agreed to send me a new one. The only thing that worried me about this& is that it would not come in time for my other half's birthday. By the skin of it's teeth& it arrived on the big day! Thankfully the second one did say the right wording. The quality matches the price. I decided on this specific product as it reminded me of the one we had when I was younger otherwise I think I would of chosen a better quality decoration."
8332,2571,5," I had an old one of these that was past its best and was pleased to find it available on Amazon at a very reasonable price. As it's thin cardboard it can be used time and time again. I only wish they would make them in one colour - say silver or gold& that would look much more classy and give customers a greater choice and blend in with decor better. Not disappointed at all with this product though."
8333,2571,5," Great for work to trim up desks for birthdays - bit more flexible than the cheap banner type and look much nicer"
8334,2571,5," As expected"
8335,2571,5," Perfect price and multi colour looks effective."
8336,2572,5," Perfect"
8337,2573,5," I bought this for my daughters birthday party and it was perfect. Very big I could have even cut it down to use on a couple of walls."
8338,2573,4," not as giant as expected but an ok size and did use them& more for household decoration rather than decorating a hall"
8339,2573,4," Fast delivery but thought I was getting 3seperate banners but they are all on one"
8340,2573,5," Lovely big banner with age on couldn't find these in shops will look here again"
8341,2574,5," As described with prompt delivery"
8342,2575,5," Good"
8343,2576,5," seems fine& just shame it got all creased in the post"
8344,2576,5," Lovely looking banner and great price!"
8345,2576,5," Very pleased with product"
8346,2576,5," Lovly thankyou"
8347,2576,5," great quality"
8348,2577,5," Agree with EMW....I have just received my package and now ordered up another five (I hope they aren't sold out as this appears a bargain). The flags will decorate the fencing around our Jubilee garden party. And yes the flags on printed plastic are the correct way up."
8349,2577,5," This bunting was strong with good distances between flags and sensible length cord at the end for attachment purposes. I would thoroughly recommend as a party decoration. It would be especially suitable for jubilee/royal wedding celebrations. I didn't check that the flags were the right way up."
8350,2577,5," Bunting arrived later than forecast but in time for the Jubilee&  I was really pleased with the quality of the product as several other sites were selling what appeared to be the same for 3 times the price.  The flags were plastic and were used to decorate the outside of the house and accross the street.  They were up for a week and survived the wind and rain.  Worth buying if you want something for the Euros of Olympics."
8351,2577,4," It was as it said really& practical and durable. I had hoped that it was longer than it was ... it was not 9 meters of bunting but maybe it was 9m of item& which included strings. THat was the only disappointment. It was strong& and lasted being tied to the outside of the house for three days& through the jubilee wind and sweeping rain.  It was lightweight but this was fine& and it did the job."
8352,2577,5," Great quality bunting.  Comes well packaged and exactly as described.  Speedy delivery very happy with the service throughout.. Looking forward to the jubilee weekend and this has made a great decoration."
8353,2577,5," THIS BUNTING IS BETTER VALUE THAN I HAVE SEEN ON THE HIGHSTREET - PRINTED BOTH SIDES& VERY REASONABLE PRICE& LOOKS GOOD."
8354,2577,5," 6 packs of this plastic Union Flag bunting were bought for use at our road's Diamond Jubilee street party.Strung high up across the width of our hill& the strings of bunting not only confidently withstood the gales and lashing rain of Diamond Jubilee weekend and the ensuing week but were& in fact& still perfectly re-useable when they were eventually taken down!Talk about value for money!"
8355,2577,3," This bunting was very well received by my somewhat jingoistic mother. She hung it in several of her windows for the Royal Wedding but I knew it would stay there till Kingdom come& and I was right. Therefore I can say with some confidence that it is nice and long and pretty durable and will probably last at least until Harry ties the knot with that hooker from Vegas. Rule Britannia!"
8356,2578,5," looked great with all the other items i purchased"
8357,2579,5," Excellent Thanks"
8358,2580,5," Perfect. Just what i was looking for. Thanks"
8359,2581,4," Difficult to get excited about banners but since there were no reviews& thought I should leave one! Ordered for a 65th birthday party& they look exactly like the picture. The different colours mean that they would go with most colour themes and they are holographic they add a bit of shine to the occasion!Good value and free postage... Can't complain."
8360,2581,5," Bought this banner for husband's 65th birthday. He cannot keep it a secret& now everyone will know& as the banners are bright and sparkly"
8361,2581,5," Really bright and clear banner& could be read from a distance& good seller& will deal with them again thank you"
8362,2581,5," This is excellent& it is what it is& can not wait to use it. Looks just like image on website."
8363,2581,5," Nice& as expected& get three for your money& just tear apart"
8364,2581,4," Very sturdy and did not tear in the wind good value"
8365,2581,5," As described and speedy delivery."
8366,2581,5," Perfect for my husbands birhtday"
8367,2582,4," put this up on father days for dad will put this up again for his birthdayjust like a normal banner"
8368,2582,5," Prompt dispatch. Great product. Now packed away and will reuse year after year."
8369,2582,5," Arrived quickly& product was just as described!"
8370,2582,5," Decent price for a quality banner!"
8371,2583,5," Very pleased with this banner.perfect for son mad on football.good quality .arrived quick."
8372,2583,5," Good product"
8373,2583,4," As picture"
8374,2583,5," excenalt"
8375,2584,3," This banner arrived and was shorter than I had imagined& sizes may have been given on the info on the product but I did not pick up on this. I am sure it will do the job though"
8376,2584,5," arrived promptly& did the job"
8377,2584,5," Thank you"
8378,2584,5," Great."
8379,2584,5," Thanks"
8380,2585,1," Arrived way later than expected arrival date so missed the party. Quality ok and matched the stuff i bought elsewhere....shame it is now totally useless!!"
8381,2585,3," it was good but a bit bent this has nothing to do with the seller it was the product but still recommend and seller very fast delivery"
8382,2585,5," These banners were really lovely and were of a good quality.  Highly recommend for a 60th birthday.  Yes& very happy."
8383,2585,4," Great Banners stood out in the room very pleased and looked great too. Quite long enough and good quality and strong."
8384,2585,5," Really nice banner and much longer than the normal you find in Clintons. Good quality as well"
8385,2585,5," not taken out of the packet yet but looks like it will be suitable"
8386,2585,4," Exactly as expected - can be used as it comes or cut into 3"
8387,2585,5," looked good went with the rest of the party things"
8388,2586,4," Good quality but shorter than I expected"
8389,2587,5," lovely"
8390,2588,5," Gud but came to l8t will save them for Nxt yr!!"
8391,2589,2," These thin plastic flags are nearly transparent so useless if hanging against a dark or patterned background.  Flags are also very widely spaced so you don't actually get that many flags for your 10m& just a lot of string!"
8392,2589,4," Great flags for the price& was perfect for our eurovision party"
8393,2589,5," As described.  Good fun flags."
8394,2589,5," perfect for a party"
8395,2590,5," Arrived quickly& well made and strong perfect for a hen night thank you"
8396,2590,5," This bunting is lovely& well& for hen-party-related items that is! To be honest& it's tacky but I didn't buy them for a classy-affair.They are durable& look pretty and hang easily: I couldn't really ask for more!"
8397,2590,5," Fab quality. The only way it could have been better is if it was double sided. But that's only because I hung it separating two rooms."
8398,2590,5," These looked great for a garden party for the hen. Would recommend this product and Seller Partyrama."
8399,2590,5," Great value quality item arrived quickly very pleased"
8400,2590,5," Great value product. Worth the money. Looked great"
8401,2590,5," V impressed great buy! And value for money"
8402,2591,5," It looks great and my daughter is going to love it on her birthday. Thanks"
8403,2592,5," brill"
8404,2593,5," bought a couple of these - just the job to hang from the washing line as we were having a bouncy castle in the garden - definately gave it that party look"
8405,2594,2," Quality is fine& but I was very disappointed in the quantity. Why the item title has X10 in it when there is only one banner baffles me. When you dig into the item there is a sub heading that explains there is only one banner& but who actually gets this far when ordering? The item title is misleading and can surely be easily modified."
8406,2594,5," This banner was just what we expected.  It is a long banner& easy to put up we used a sticky tacky that was blue."
8407,2594,5," All good& nice and shiny and did the job!"

8414,2596,4," Good qualiy banner was able to put several around a large hall to decorate for a party.Was able to pass them on for friends to use for their party.Now had 4 uses!"
8415,2597,4," Great banner. would have been better if they had rolled and not folded the banner."
8416,2597,5," Couldnt find any pink age 9 banners in the shops.. these were perfect"
8417,2597,5," Fast delivery very good quality"

8435,2603,3," Arrived super fast. Quite thin and easily torn when I put on wide gate with drawing pins in the wind. I should have taped to gate. Inexpensive and only needed for a few hours so did the job."

8455,2607,5," Was longer than expected& so managed to get 2 banners out of the one packet."
8456,2607,3," Bit smaller than I was expecting. But arrived in good time."
8457,2607,4," bit flimsy and creased in one place but lots to work with"
8458,2608,3," This is a nice big banner but I'm only giving 3 stars as it says there are 3 banners but there was only one. Good product but I was expecting more banners"
8459,2608,5," Exactly as described. Arrived quickly. Looked good at my kids birthday party. Not much more to say about a banner really...."

8467,2610,5," This will good great with all the other monster high stuff we have bought for a 9th birthday party. It comes in one long banner all joined together but you can easy pull it apart to have it like in the picture. The print is very good quality and the card is like any other party banner you get and it is an original monster high product not a rubbish copy."
8468,2610,4," Very big& made my daughter's day!The only negative is that the monster high detail isn't as defined as I would have wanted. It's 'monster high' mainly in that it is the monster high colours. But certainly made the statement she neeed"
8469,2610,5," Great quality and great price for this item . Delivery was quick and receive well before the expected date of delivery. MY monster high loving daughter was very happy to see this birthday banner . I recommend the company and the item ."
8470,2610,3," Product ok& but unable to use& as it was ordered for my daughter's birthday& but it arrived 12 days after her birthday so now I will either give to someone who will use it or hope my daughter still likes Monster High by next birthday."
8471,2610,5," This is a must for any Monster High fan celebrating their birthday& my daughter and her friends loved it& she still has it up in her bedroom a month after her birthday. Good delivery time and reasonable price."
8472,2610,5," A monster high& theme birthday party.  How much better could it get?  It couldn't!  Come on... It's Monster High we're talking about here. My daughter and friends would seriously agree to that."
8473,2610,5," Bought this for my granddaughter's birthday party as she loves monster high&her mum had it hanging on wall when granddaughter came downstairs and loved the surprise."
8474,2611,3," Looked a bit cheap& but was fun at the time. Did not wear as well as the material bunting& as the plastic stuck to itself and the print was compromised."
8475,2611,5," This was a last minute buy. Was exactly what I needed and arrived very quickly& in time for a show I was doing."
8476,2611,5," Arrived very quick excellent product looked really good when fastened round fence for granddaughters birthday"
8477,2611,5," Perfect ...our friend and colleague is leaving for the states used this on and around his desk"
8478,2611,5," Exactly as I thought they would be& fun for any occasion!  Delivered quickly."
8479,2611,5," Great quality& great price& fast delivery. Looked great at our 4th July party"
8480,2611,5," Looked very decorative in preparation for trip to New York!"
8481,2611,4," It was just right for the occasion we had planned."
8482,2612,5," Very good quality banner to help celebrate a very special birthday!"
8483,2613,5," Great value"
8484,2614,5," This item is good because it can be used has a long banner or cut it into four indivdual banners& I purchased two set and cut them too make eight in total. Again the colour matched well with the other items purchased. My grandmother enjoyed all the items."
8485,2614,5," This is a lovely quality item and very eye catching&itwas perfect for the occasion and did not tear when putting up or taking down"
8486,2614,5," Excellent value and quality& which can be kept as one long banner or cut into separate lengths"
8487,2614,4," Arrived on time& very PINK."
8488,2614,5," Good banners delivered on time for the party."
8489,2615,5," I bought this product for my  daughters 18th. it was decent quality and was reasonably priced. Would buy from here again"
8490,2615,5," This was just right for my daughters 18th birthday celebrations& we cut them up so that we had a few around the room"
8491,2615,5," lovely and wide also nice and glitzy. come apart easily so can be put about thr room rather than one long one"
8492,2615,5," Bargin very pleased with my purchase it does exactly what it says on the packet lol. Great seller."
8493,2615,5," Great value for money& look great and cheaper than the high street stores"
8494,2615,4," Great but up by venue on previous night. What a pity good product"
8495,2615,5," Very happy with item just as advertised and speedy delivery"
8496,2615,4," I like the holographic effect and it is good value!"
8497,2616,4," Good product"
8498,2617,4," Banner contained one long piece& but could be split down into 3 sections& each with 40th birthday on.Durable and easy to put up.  Have passed this on for someone else to use& as it lasted really well!"
8499,2617,4," Arrived before time. Very happy with product and service. Thank you"
8500,2617,5," nice and bright and big..great addition to a party deco"
8501,2617,5," Great service banners are fab"
8502,2617,5," Good value for money."
8503,2618,5," Fab"
8504,2619,4," Really pleased as it was for my grand daughters birthday in New Zealand. Got there on time and she loved it."
8505,2620,5," Excellent banner& great length and can be made into 3 shorter ones if required. Arrived promptly and was well packaged& just what I wanted!"
8506,2621,5," Didn't actually buy from amazon as you never had these ones in when I was looking.However this is such a sweet looking ukulele and the picture doesn't do it justice.Brought for my 9 yr old daughter and she loves it  and is even trying to learn how to play it through youtube videos.Got to say out of all her xmas presents this is the one she has played with the most and would recommend to any one thinking of getting this."
8507,2622,5," well worth money and would be buying from again when needed. I found these pretty strong and lasted far longer"
8508,2623,5," Excellent bunting very pleased brought lots that match"
8509,2624,5," My 8yr old son loved these and they looked impressive hanging over the table around the light fitting. Glad I chose them and great for any WWE fan"
8510,2624,5," They were brilliant an bigger than I thought"
8511,2624,5," my son will love this !"
8512,2625,4," Fast delivery was pleased with my purchases"
8513,2625,3," Bunting arrived bent in the package!"
8514,2625,5," Great for parties."
8515,2626,5," The flag sizes are decent enough and the quality reasonable for the price. Will look great for my World Cup party. I thought they had confused the Italy flag and included the Ireland flag& turns out I am a 'plum' and was looking at it from the wrong side and it is Ivory Coast! Fear not the Italy flag is also there too. (Revised review)"
8516,2626,5," Bought to create a little |World Cup| atmosphere to the Bar of a restaurant those flags do the job perfectly. The length is good and the price too."
8517,2626,5," Great for a World Cup party. It's not Ireland& it's Ivory Coast! You Plum! There's flag books available on here too"
8518,2626,5," Purchased 6 packs of these to decorated an extremley large office for the World Cup. They were perfect and made a massive impact in such a large space. The flags are double sided (unlike some of the same price range). the flags themselves are large colourful and made from fabric.Excellent purchase that will be used time and time again in the future."
8519,2626,5," This bunting is really big& perfect for the world cup - it's bigger than it looks in the photos!  The flags are actually made of fabric rather than paper& which is much nicer.  Arrived quickly.  We actually wanted the flags rather than them connected together but found that this was the cheapest way to get all of the flags."
8520,2626,4," The item was of good quality and as described. Not much else to say about the product as it was bunting but of good quality! The delivery took longer than expected as arrived 2 days later than was told so waited 10 days in total??Nothing to complain about."
8521,2626,3," The quality of the item did not match its price. Two of the flags were only half stitched into the header tape and sections of the header tape were bunched up as though the sewing machine tension had not been properly set."
8522,2626,5," bought for world cup atmosphere in house arrived early& all perfect look great just wish they were on offer when i bought them as only just ordered having said that would recommend to others and buy again"
8523,2627,4," Great effect for a spiderman themed party the kids loved them (they look great with the Christmas  tree too!) They went up no bother with just a tack in ceiling but I reckon they would hold with blue tack or sellotape too. There are only 6 spirals with pictures though the rest have nothing at the bottom which we didn't bother to hang."
8524,2627,4," Too long really but fab product!! My boy loved it so I saved them and have put them up in his Spiderman bedroom."
8525,2627,5," looked great for the party room and will then be hung in the boy's bedroom - he was so happy!"
8526,2627,5," Spiderman swirls looked great hanging from ceiling& my son absolutely loved them."
8527,2627,4," Only a few in the pack have the 'SpiderMan' on the bottom& the rest are plain"
8528,2628,3," These are really nice and arrived on time& however for 6 swirls I only had 3 character badges& the other 3 swirls just hung down looking pretty. Not sure if this was how it was meant to be& but was in such a rush for a party& I didn't argue at the time as was just pleased they arrived ok!"
8529,2628,3," Disappointed hugely in this item I ordered 2 thinking that it was 6 with cars characters on them instead it was 3 and 3 plain and both with the same characters but I know my son will love them so will order some more and chuck the ones with nothing on them."
8530,2628,5," Son loved these hanging from lounge ceiling as part of birthday decorations& so much so that they are now in his bedroom as a permanent fixture.  Good quality for the money and very original& not seen on the high st."
8531,2628,5," Really pleased with these Disney Cars decorations. For the price they are well made and they look lovely...great product! Will brighten up the party and can be used again after the big day :o)"
8532,2628,4," very beautiful hanging but remember to use many tapes to stick on the ceiling cos mine keeps falling down. I had to use 2 sided tape and long sellotape make a cross on them"
8533,2628,5," Excellent service.  Made my 3yr olds birthday party enjoyable for all.Thank for your time and assistance.Will reccomend to all my friends."
8534,2628,1," Very different to what is shown in the picture.  Very misleading.  If it wasn't so much effort to send them back& I would be doing.  Avoid."
8535,2628,4," They were brilliant for my 3year olds birthdayThe swirls will be used again for my daughters party( I will cut the cars off&)"
8536,2629,5," Very effective - used these to decorate the house for my daughter's birthday party - had several complements from the other parents who saw them and also wanted to get some. Can be reused& you just need to be careful that they don't get tangled when being stored. Glad I bought them!"
8537,2629,5," As described and arrived on time."
8538,2629,5," Good quality"
8539,2629,5," Lovely"
8540,2630,3," Very pretty stars - brighten up a party and they were a hit with the children. I would only recommend you buy them though for indoor use. I put some up in a doorway and the slightest wind tangled them up and they are quite impossible to detangle. I even had some in a window& and the same happened once the window was open."
8541,2630,3," The stringed stars were not very durable but did hang in the door to create a good effect.  The strings are strong enough to brush by but they did get easily tangled.  A good idea for the party though"
8542,2630,5," excellent for a kids party! my nephew loved them!but they did tend to ravel up and tear really easily but good value for money"
8543,2630,5," These arrived on time in suitable packaging that was undamaged. Each one is wrapped in a thin plastic slip. They are attached in groups of three by white thin elastic to a bit of card to stop them slipping and getting bent/creased. They are made of shiny foil material and thin white string. I still have these attached to my door frame over a week later! If you have boisterous kids then you may want to use them somewhere they can't 'flow freely' as they will snap if caught on anything moving fast. Easily repacked to use again. Happy I bought them."
8544,2630,5," Each pach contains six individual strings of stars for you to add a touch of sparkle to doorways or windows during a party.  Well packed and easy to hang. I expected to get tangled up and have a knotty mess& but each string unwound beautifully& allowing me to create a curtain of stars at the door for my daughter's birthday party."
8545,2630,5," these stars are good fun.  We hung them as part of our 'disco'.  The kids didn't have the chance to run through them and I'm not sure they would have lasted long if they had& but we enjoyed them.  Good fun!"
8546,2630,5," Flimsy& so be careful"
8547,2630,3," Trusted seller and quick delivery. Great for a kids party. We didn't actually use it as a door hanger in the end because they kept knotting together so we just hung them separately around the room."
8548,2631,4," Short string of bunting (14 pennants) suitable for hanging inside.  Reasonably tasteful design which is not stridently red& blue and white.  Suitably festive."
8549,2631,5," This bunting was beautiful and quirky. Everyone who saw it in my salons window asked where it had come from :)"
8550,2632,5," Nicely packaged& arrived on time and looked very nice.Also didn't 'stick together' as much as most of the other types of table comfetti."
8551,2632,5," This was bought for my friends 25 Wedding Anniversary. She loved it as her favourite drink is Champagne !&"
8552,2632,5," These looked really nice on my wedding table very pleased and came on time"
8553,2632,5," Exactly what I wanted. Good vue.  Prompt delivery"
8554,2632,5," Delivered quickly. Exactly what I wanted."
8555,2633,4," Nice little set of lanterns great in this weather especially for bbqs and party's and fold away after use to be reused great product and great idea :)"
8556,2634,4," Really good quality plates with fab design.Kids loved them"
8557,2634,5," Great quality and was perfect for my 3 year olds little party"
8558,2634,5," Great value and durable for kids parties :)"
8559,2634,5," Excellent quality and fast delivery"
8560,2635,5," Very good got these for my engagement party and I was very happy with them. Would definitely recommend  price is great too."
8561,2635,5," Happy Engagement Confetti Table Decorationjust what it sayslovely display for any table.makes a table look very speacial"
8562,2635,5," Fit for purpose. True to view. Exactly what they say on the tin! Made a nice difference to the table at my engagement party."
8563,2635,4," Very fast delivery and are of good quality& i did exspect there to be more in the bag but overall great"
8564,2635,5," Very pleased with this product.  Made the table look pretty.  Arrived in good time."
8565,2635,5," They were better than I thought lovely rings hearts I will be ordering more"
8566,2635,5," Brilliant would use this seller again. Thank you. Price is very reasonable"
8567,2635,5," Just arrived& excellent service and pleased with goods."
8568,2636,5," These arrived nice and quickly and these were much better than what i expected.  They were such good quality.  i would definitely recommend these."
8569,2636,5," Perfect for&the job"
8570,2636,5," Beautiful  bunting"
8571,2636,5," Really good"
8572,2637,5," Very good to add some colour to the room. The garland actually says happy birthday not happy anniversary in french. I'm very pleased with my purchase."
8573,2638,1," I would not recommend this product as its so thin and you can't do anything with it. we did not end up using it& so a complete wast!I ordered this due to how cheap it was and next time I will pay more and get a better quality stuff."
8574,2638,5," Used this product at a Dalmatian Centenary Dog show and everyone very impressed& good quality and reusable if you are careful."
8575,2638,5," I had to decorate the house for a FAR AWAY TREE party. These streamer were brilliant. Big impact& for little money."
8576,2639,5," Looked in several shops for 70th confetti unable to find anywhere& Bargain for the price& would recommend!"
8577,2639,5," Excellent& arrived in 2 days&  perfectly describe exactly how they are..... definitely use again"
8578,2639,5," Exactly what we needed for our special birthday party.  Received in good time too.  Recommended."
8579,2639,5," Looked really pretty on the table. Plenty in the packet."
8580,2639,5," Just what we needed."
8581,2639,5," Just what I wanted"
8582,2640,5," cant wait until EASTER to hang them !"
8583,2641,5," great thanks"
8584,2642,5," Like the picture suggests. Quick delivery"
8585,2643,5," Made a great impact& love the fact there were two designs in the pack. Hung lovely nice length drop from the ceiling& great addition to the other party decorations :-)"
8586,2643,5," These are lovely! They make a room look great for a birthday celebration and are excellent quality. Perfect for anyone's 50th."
8587,2643,5," They were lovely.  Really added to the party atmosphere and worth getting to make more of s statement as well as banners."
8588,2643,5," Beautiful decorations which were perfect for my husband's 50th Birthday Party!"
8589,2643,5," brought this item for my wife's birthday.great product.went down well"
8590,2644,5," I ordered this bunting for our village fete and it was perfect.  The flags are made of durable plastic& but thin enough to wave in the wind and give a good effect.  The bunting was really long& stretching all the way down our races area.  It really brought a smile to the guests and decorated the area nicely.  Delivery was super quick too!"
8591,2644,4," It came on time& the price was right and it did what it was expected to do& I'm happy with my purchase."
8592,2644,5," I ordered this for our Spring Fair. It arrived very promptly and I can say it was very good value for money. I would recommend this product."
8593,2644,5," This is no toy so think this product could be under wrong category. The bunting was very sturdy& strong hold and stretched enough to securely put up. Colours were bight and clean. Great value for money would buy again& had loads left over and can easily use the product again."
8594,2644,5," This is the second time we have bought this product. The first set lasted 4 years and we only replaced it as the colours were fading a bit& but as it goes up at Easter and stays up til October& that's not surprising! A great addition to the garden."
8595,2644,5," This bunting was great to brighten up our kitchen for her party seemed durable and if you wanted could be cut to size. Good for the price and we will def. be able to use it again and again."
8596,2644,5," Exactly what I wanted. Cheap and cheerful and will only be used for about 6 hours slung between trees by entrance to Church Hall. It arrived promptly.."
8597,2644,5," Bought this for a tea party. Nice colours and looked great. So cheap that I bought two! Am very happy"
8598,2645,5," spread them on her bed"
8599,2645,5," I bought this item to put inside a valentines card& they are lovely."
8600,2645,5," Amazing item for the price and each petal is a counted for!!"
8601,2645,4," Get what you pay for& does the job and cheap as chips"
8602,2645,1," I guess you get what you pay for. Delivery was speedy and quick but even advertising on the packet that they were 99p rather than the Â£1.87 I paid is a kick in the teeth. Looks tacky& thrown in bin."
8603,2646,4," We bought this to decorate a Tropical themed party and it looks amazing. It's a little bit delicate& which is what you would expect for paper& especially when opening the lanterns which rip easily. A few lanterns have already fallen off but they can easily be tied back on. We tried putting a fake tea light inside the lanterns but the light didn't shine through that well."
8604,2646,5," These garlands are fantastic and everyone at my party commented on them and couldn't believe the price! They're well made and though it's a little bit fiddly to extend each of the paper lanterns out& it doesn't take that long to get them hung up. They're really colourful and cheer up the room. I loved them so much that 5 days after the party they're still up..."
8605,2646,3," Some of the lanterns were hard to open out as seemed to be stuck together so not ideal. Good idea for decoration though."
8606,2646,5," I bought this lantern garland to put up to brighten my room for the Summer Solstice.It arrived quickly from the seller and for the very reasonable price am delighted by the excellent quality! The lantern garland looks amazing when up and is very bright and vibrant& esp good for any summer or tropical theme. Very happy I bought this :-)"
8607,2646,4," Arrived super quick. I think they were on the door step the next morning!The lanterns are of a good quality and look exactly as you see them here& bright and vibrant.I ordered these for my daughters 3rd birthday party in our garden and it is much simpler to pop these up than 100 balloons!"
8608,2646,5," purchased this as it was a good& cheap price to add to the decorations for my daughter's hawaiian birthday party.  it arrived within the estimated time& packed well and was easy to hang up.  it looked really nice - the colours are bright but not garish.  a great product!"
8609,2646,3," Nearly brillianr - the reason I have given only 3 is that the lanterns are hard to pull out.  They ended up a bit wonky and it was too easy to tear the paper.  But it all looked very festive and colorful& esp with the garlands we odrered."
8610,2646,5," You need a few to party but these are a great product and cheap at the price& add to the atmosphere whether it's a kids party or tropical theme or to add a bit of colour to room or garden - not water proof so watch out for showers! Fab!"
8611,2647,5," Does the job. Shorter than I expected& possibly long enough to drape across a door. In hindsight it may have been better to have ordered 2 to link across a wall."
8612,2647,5," Really pleased with bunting. Good quality."
8613,2647,5," Great purchase and great value for money."
8614,2648,4," As expected& good service"
8615,2649,5," Very good quality product &you can use it many times.My son loves it as he is big angry birds fan."
8616,2650,5," came quickly and was perfect for the jubilee.Seems quite strong as it coped with a very windy weekend without any problems."
8617,2650,5," It does what it says so nothing else to say. They are really nice and quite strong.it makes the room looks good for my daughters french birthday party. Very pleased with my purchase.thank you."
8618,2650,4," The only drawback is that the product was pretty crushed in the packaging. Hopefully I can flatten them out ok."
8619,2650,5," Excellent& perfect for the guy ropes on the Gazebo at the Gala. Good quality and being plastic& waterproof. Would recommend this product."
8620,2650,4," Bought this to use as decoration for a themed summer garden party. It was just what I was looking for."
8621,2650,3," The bunting is fine BUT is not 10 metres in length. Nowhere near that length& and I need it for a concert tomorrow. I have had to order more which has not yet arrived. Very disappointing"
8622,2650,4," Just wanted something cheap for my sons birthday& these were cheap& free quick delivery and worked a treat.  Garden looked great."
8623,2650,4," Arrived way before time stated& in good order the only reason I gave 4 stars is that the blue is lighter than the picture."
8624,2651,5," Great quality. Just the job to decorate our house for the little ones special day!"
8625,2651,5," Excellent"
8626,2652,5," Brilliant& bright bunting for my mum's 70th birthday. Definitely recommend."
8627,2653,4," We are pleased with this item but it's a bit fiddly and if not opened up correctly then it's very difficult to an do. But in general it's looked very nice on our white walls and the guest commented nicely about them. Very pleased with our purchase. It also arrived earlier than the estimated time that was given to us."
8628,2654,3," Colour not as expected but could mix with other darker purple decorations."
8629,2654,5," As expected and a good change from xmas trimmings"
8630,2654,5," As expected and a good change from xmas trimmings"
8631,2655,5," Just what I wanted ! Ive Ordered this off amazon before from another company  it's been completely different to the picture what turned so this was perfect up."
8632,2655,2," Confetti was as expected but came over a week late& christening was over and so it was totally useless!! Very disappointing!"
8633,2655,5," Thank - you for my items& and they were posted quickly."
8634,2655,5," Quick delivery and lovely product thanks!"
8635,2655,5," Good item& quick delivery. Very pleased"
8636,2655,5," Exactly what I was after."
8637,2656,5," Very pleased with this& I bought it for my engagement party and managed to make a few different phrases& then unstrung and have restrung it in three different phrases for a friends hen party. Seems to be lasting well so I hope to get many more uses out of it yet!"
8638,2657,3," A bit dear when I started to look in the shops for these. I dont think I would buy these sorts of things again from the internet."
8639,2657,3," Received the confetti but it was not black and silver as expected. The pack I received was only black and was clearly a much cheaper pack than that shown. As I had a black and silver theme planned this was a shame& but is only confetti at the end of the day... would have been annoyed if it was something more important."
8640,2657,2," Good sprinkles however when they arrived at my work they were coming out the envelope and think they had been whilst in the post and when I opened the envelope they all fell out."
8641,2657,2," Got this confetti today was meant to be black and silver but just all black so I've had to go to tesco and get silver confetti to mix in to get theme right."
8642,2657,5," A good idea for table decorations. I mixed them in with green stars to go with my colour scheme& but looked great on their own anyway"
8643,2657,5," These sparkly 30th birthday confetti decorations looked really lovely on the table. Thank you& great items& just the job.... GREAT"
8644,2657,5," Cant wait to use these&  (even if they are a nighmare to clean up)"
8645,2657,5," Looked great on the table when celebrating a 30th birthday!"
8646,2658,5," Excellent bunting/decoration& large size and great for three sides of my 3 metre square gazebo.  I have bought in several colours& I think it is good value."
8647,2658,5," Perfect for outdoor use as intended. Will be used again for a birthday party soon."
8648,2658,5," Looked really good in the garden - good quality for the price paid"
8649,2659,5," A few months ago I reached my 60th birthday. Whilst planning a large family party we needed to make it fun and in no small way finding these serviettes was a stroke of luck. They are as bright and cheerful as they appear on screen and certainly were the finishing touch we needed. At the price they are such good value you cannot fail to to like them. As serviettes they are as good as any you'll find elsewhere. Recommended."
8650,2659,5," Excellent valueWell worth the buy and arrived in exceedingly good time!Thanks you very much it was much cheaper and easier that a high street purchase."
8651,2659,5," These were lovely to decorate the tables at the party& was nice that they advised 1 bag to 3 tables and they were spot on!! Great value great find!!"
8652,2659,5," someone is 60 in my family this year so we are doing a big party for them I hope that it go onarrived on time package was the right size"
8653,2659,5," great item& theses are good value for money and look good.They are vibrant in colour and sparkle as well. they are just right for the job"
8654,2659,5," Just what i needed for a surprise 60th and at a reasonable price& which in todays climate is hard to find. Will deffo buy more if needed"
8655,2659,5," Bought for a surprise birthday meal arranged at an excellent local pub. Caused suitable light hearted embarrassment for the recipient."
8656,2659,5," Great value for money and an excellent idea for table decorations or anywhere really. Nice variation of colours and g.ood quality too"
8657,2660,5," an addictive and entertaining game of chance and skill& once into the game it is hard to stop playing& keep trying to better your previous score& the options are endless. great fun."
8658,2660,3," The big advantage of this game is that it can be played by up to 7 people at once and the rules are simple enough for all ages to learn quickly& good for family get togethers. The winning position can change at every round keeping up the tension."
8659,2660,5," My father introduced me to this game a few years ago& we have played so often that the cards have started to stick together& we have put them in a bag with talk many time already.  This Christmas I was stuck for gift ideas and so I have purchased three sets of five crowns one for may father& one for me and a set for my daughter who also enjoys this family game.I love this game& it's easy to play and is good for all ages.  I have even taken it on school trips for children to play on long coach journeys.  It's fun and educational!"
8660,2660,5," Plays under Rummy rules but with a twist.  There are no aces or 2's and there are 5 suits.  Spades& Clubs& Hearts& Diamonds and Stars.  Jokers are always wild but in addition the wild card changes with each deal.  On the first deal& of 3 cards 3's are wild.  On the second deal of 4 cards 4's are wild& and so on up to the King.  At the end of 11 rounds the winner is the person with the lowest score.  A brilliant game that really keeps you thinking.  Recommended."
8661,2660,5," Children and adults over 10 years will enjoy this game. It's the kind of game that will pack away for holiday evenings when family games are often best enjoyed."
8662,2660,5," A great game to play with all the family& it can get very intense if players are competitive& once mastered then move onto Wizard."
8663,2660,5," This game is addictive!  The game is very similar to Rummy but with some great changes.  There is an extra star suit now& hence the title of Five Crowns.  We got quite competitive playing it and had to force ourselves to stop playing to go to bed!  I'm going to give it as Christmas presents to family and friends that love playing card games.  Great present idea.  Packing and design of the cards is very clear.  Instructions are clear but recommend you read thoroughly and read them as you play your first few games until you get the hang of it."
8664,2660,4," Good game for the card player enthusiasts. Madecsurecshecwas pleasant change.Good delivery as detailed at purchase&  within 3 days of order.Very happy.Chris U"
8665,2661,5," The front and back design of these is great& the box design is great& the handling and shuffling of the cards are great& everything about the cards are just great!"
8666,2661,4," This deck is great&colourful &durable&fun&perfect for colour changes and has three cool gaff cards great for flourishes especially card springing."
8667,2661,5," nice cards"
8668,2662,5," I bought these cards for two old ladies who still enjoy a game occasionally. Unfortunately one of them has failing eyesight and yet refuses to wear glasses. These cards are an ideal size and easy for them to handle. Not only have they enabled them to continue with their pastime but have stopped them falling out over misplayed cards. We all enjoy a more relaxing time now."
8669,2662,4," We use the cards (with a home made board) at charity events to raise money.|higher"
8670,2662,5," There are excellent and durable large playing cards for Poker and other card games"
8671,2662,5," Excellent product& my mother is blind in one eye and partially sighted in the other.  The size of these cards are just right for playing on the table&  my mother can now play solitaire once again (albeit slow and with a magnifier - better than not at all) and has given her pleasure being able to do something!  Highly reccommend"
8672,2662,5," I am disabled and amongst other things my co-ordination is affected. Large playing cards are ideal for me . I can handle them easily. Shuffling them can be difficult but you can't have it all ways. I use them to play solitaire and find them very good. They are very durable. Considering they are used everyday they hold up well. These playing cards would be ideal for people with sight limitations. I would recommend them."
8673,2662,5," The cards were used for the 'Play Your Cards Right' game at a School Gala.  Great for this."
8674,2662,3," Purchased these cards to use for a children's party game. They are roughly the size of an adult's hand. Had I actually read the discription better and taken time to check out the measurements properly I would have noticed these cards are not giant at all. Basically the name is misleading and had I searched a bit more I would have found the A4 size I had in mind. Too late to change them for me but they will do. Thought I just let you know."
8675,2662,5," I bought these cards as I thought they would be good for my small boy and easier to handle. This was actually the opposite as he could actually hold less as they were big.  Anyway he loves them. A bit too big for small kids to actually play poker or rummy& good for snap but also a bit small for play your cards right. Not so good for old people either as even though the numbers are nice and big for them to read& the problem is the same& they cannot hold them.  Maybe they are just a novelty gift.They come in a lovely box&not a cardboard casing which always splits."
8676,2663,4," A good family game& quite expensive though."
8677,2664,4," We've had great fun with these top trumps& had a good laugh at the Christmas dinner table.  Would recommend as another set of top trumps to add to your collection."
8678,2664,5," This is a great gift. Only issue is that this deck contains a j saville card which was removed and destroyed.Great fun for any Burp fan."
8679,2664,4," You know what you're getting with Harry Hill's face on it.  It's just a little bit of silly fun...bringing back some familiar tv |legend| names.  If you've got a few quid spare for a fun little gift for someone& you could do worse!"
8680,2664,4," Bought this as a Christmas present for my brother and it was the surprise hit of the holiday.  Everyone had a lot of fun playing it.  Great fun& light entertainment for all."
8681,2664,5," This is a cool pack of top trumps with a hilarious team. It's just a laugh and a giggle& ........ if you like Top Trumps& and comedy buy it!"
8682,2665,5," we were at the airport and was told our flight had been delayed and a family happen to sit next to us (my 8 year old) and started playing& we started watching and listening and joining in.  great fun& easy to play with easy to guide instructions&  all picture cards and you need a good poker face ha  as soon as i got home i bought the game. thanks to the lovely family who was kind enough to share."
8683,2665,5," My kids recently played this game at a friends house and loved it so I had to buy it for our family. My two boys 8 and 7 really enjoy playing it. It is very easy to understand the rules and get playing quickly. It is essentially a game of bluff. Can you tell if your child is telling the truth? You will love trying to spot their |tells|. I think this is currently our most popular |family| game."
8684,2665,5," Our new favourite game! Very simple but clever! The chain of figuring out who is bluffing makes the game innovative."
8685,2665,5," Great game loved by everybody of all ages whose played it with me."
8686,2666,5," These cards are so much better quality than ordinary packs of playing cards.  The air cushion finish means they are much more manageable when my son uses them for his card tricks.  They are also very clear for a spectator to see when tricks are being performed."
8687,2666,4," My son was obsessed with this kind of cards at one point and had loads of colour including these orange ones. I guess they are ok and he likes them. They are nice and colourful."
8688,2666,5," Toy should not be used to describe these professional cards. My son is very much into magic card tricks and thinks these are wonderful"
8689,2666,5," These cards were really good to shuffle"
8690,2667,5," The children love Top Trumps - it's a great game for them - and ideal for slower readers. We will include it in our home-school reading resources next term."
8691,2668,5," Very good card cases& they look quite cool as well. Keeps all of my chosen cards at their highest condition without letting them get a single scratch on them. Very good quality cases. Highly recommended."
8692,2668,5," Does exactly as the pack and the sales page says!!... Got the item as advertised and at great value!!.... one thing to note for those who have limited deck space though is that these will add a significant amount of bulk to your deck!... I have a 60 card YuGi deck and it looks massive!!... BUT... these protectors have very little friction& which makes them easier to shuffle than the bare cards and they protect the cards well!!... it's everything a YuGiOh player/collector needs!! plain and simple... if you play a card game... GET SOME PROTECTORS!! the cards will last a significant amount of time longer for it!!"
8693,2668,5," these protect the cards really well& i would recomend them to another buyer becasue they keeps your cards in such a good condtion and yet stillplay wiht them"
8694,2669,5," This is in the same style as Uno but with a few more challenging rules. Great to move onto after Uno as kids now older and need more of a challenge"
8695,2669,5," A fantastic game that we were introduced to by a friend from the USA. After dinner fun& afternoon fun with lots of friends and family members."
8696,2669,5," We took this on holiday and my 9 year old twins were hooked. It is even better than Uno and we played it every day. Quite straight forward and only takes a few minutes to learn. Only thing you need is a pen and paper to keep score. Would definitely recommend."
8697,2669,5," bought this game for my mum's friend because we've all got our own and we recommend it to everyone :)"
8698,2669,5," Great game if you want something to last a while.  Very versatile as you can choose how many phases you want to complete before you start ie. if you want the game to take less than hour you can choose to finish when you reach phase six.  Excellent."
8699,2669,5," I bought this is as a Christmas present for my brother and sister-in-law who love board and card games. This is a really enjoyable game to play and easy to pick up for people who've never played it before."
8700,2669,5," I love this card game! I have UNO& which I also recommend& but Phase 10 is even better. My 7-year-old managed to grasp the rules after a game or two and she also loves it. The cards are OK quality"
8701,2669,5," I was first introduced to this game in Spain and loved it. On our return to England we bought our own cards. There are 10 challenges such as"
8702,2670,5," Great mini game"
8703,2670,5," Super prompt delivery. Item exactly what I hoped for. Many Thanks."
8704,2671,4," As games go& this couldn't be much simpler. The judge picks a green card& the players have five red cards each& and must pick one that most closely |goes with| the green card. It encourages debate& lateral thinking and friendly argument between all members of the family& as you try to convince the judge that |dirt| goes with |silent| better than |movie theater|.As suggested elsewhere& there are many Americanisms in this game& but there are soooo many cards that this really doesn't matter. As with all the best games& you can tailor the rules to your own making& so that the game is as easy or as short as necessary. Best of all& because there's no board& it can go anywhere."
8705,2671,5," Kids loved it& fantastic to teach words and communication. Lots of giggles lots of questions about meaning perfect exactly what I wanted"
8706,2671,5," This is a lovely fun game which it is possible for adults to enjoy as well as the children. We played it with a mixed group from 7 to 70 and had a delightful time.  It need not be too competitive and helps with reading and cognitive skills"
8707,2671,5," A great fun game to play with all ages. My 6 year old grasps it well and adores this..."
8708,2671,5," We all love this game! It's great fun for all ages."
8709,2671,4," My grandchildren really enjoyed playing this game over the festive season - more so than I did& but then it is a game for children.  I had previously played a version it in the USA& and thought that this one had been cleansed of its American bias.  This is not the case"
8710,2671,5," I love this game!!! It is great fun and lots of people can play. Well worth the money!!!  :)"
8711,2672,5," We all love Top Gear in our family& especially my younger son& who has just turned 6.  We bought this for him as one of his birthday presents and he loves it.  Aside from my personal joy at revisiting Top Trumps& which was always a popular game for wet holidays in my youth& and watching him learn the rules of his first real game& he has had hours of fun laying the cards out& grouping them in different ways& making his own Cool Wall etc etc.  The smart packaging is easy to carry around& much more robust than the perspex boxes of my youth and easier for small hands to manage.  It's also an excellent way to teach turn-taking and sharing without the obvious visual competition of eg Snakes and Ladders.  Highly recommended for any Top Gear avid !"
8712,2672,5," My car mad son loved these.  Forced me to play it again and again!"
8713,2672,5," I can't really say much about these cards as they're for a christmas present but being Top Trumps I suppose they'll be as collectable as the rest of them& my son will certainly like them and add them to his (already extensive!) collection. I'm not sure if he's ever used them for their purpose but he likes looking through them and comparing the cars with the ones he's seen on the Top Gear programmes. All in all I would say they're a good buy."
8714,2672,5," Top Trumps Specials Top Gear StuntsExcellent stocking filler for Christmas. Good quality"
8715,2673,5," Great"
8716,2674,5," A Very strong knight deck from the original Arc.  A good combination of damage healing and attack power."
8717,2675,5," I love Love Letters& and I love Adventure Time. I was very excited to see that they combined the two& and not only that -- they made LL a little more interesting by playing off the uniqueness of Adventure Time. If you've played the standard LL& then you know 95% of the rules -- they've only added a couple of tweaks to this edition.The artwork is great& the gameplay is typically high as with all LL games& and the rules for this edition (unlike my friend's Batman edition of LL) are correct. Always important in a game. :)"
8718,2675,5," Having played Love Letter before I already knew I would love this game. It is a fantastic& short game you can play with friends and family& whether they are fans table top games or not. The rules are simple to understand and the game provides a great break in a longer table top session or is enjoyable as a game to play after dinner.The added theme of Adventure Time only enhances this version of Love Letter. The tokens of affection are of a higher quality than in the original game and the 'Jake case' just looks amazing."
8719,2675,5," I love this good meme of a game& it fantastically represents the equilibrium of finn and jake the human... Good banter 10/10 ign rotten tomatoes would buy again"
8720,2675,5," fantastic game quick and unpredictable whilst still giving pro gamers a level of strategy"
8721,2675,5," Brilliant brilliant game. Many hours of family joy from this one!"
8722,2676,5," This is a Disney version of Monopoly Deal. The game sounds complicated when you read the instructions but once you start to play it's actually quite simple.Bought this for my step daughter as she likes the traditional card game version. She is now 8 years old and enjoys playing this a lot!"
8723,2676,5," Great game a great addition to the Monopoly deal range"
8724,2677,5," Don't be fooled by the fancy picture& these aren't quite the professional poker chips they say they are.  For a start they are plastic& not clay& and there are no markings on their sides.Don't get me wrong& they are perfect for first-timers and for playing poker with your mates on a boozy Saturday night in& but if you want genuine professional chips you should look elsewhere on the net.Can't argue with the price though& you could do far worse!  I'd recommend them for anyone interested in learning to play.  Perhaps& once you discover how into the game you are& you can then invest in some REAL poker chips."
8725,2677,5," Great poker chips for your home game. Not quite the professional poker chips as described but at that price you can't complain and they do the job just fine."
8726,2677,5," These poker chips are heavy and the best that i have been able to find anywhere on the net and with a lovely price to go with them. Would strongly recommend to all poker players. Beginner to pro."
8727,2678,5," I have an autistic daughter and bought this as a birthday pressie for her - she loves it and can spend a lot of time searching for all of the little items hidden amongst the beads. Her friends who are not autistic seem to have a fascination with it as well. It is the type of gift that would be great for any family on a long car / train journey as it has several different ways to play also. Sturdily made it is something I can see lasting for quite some time. A good buy and recommended"
8728,2678,5," Brought this for my 6 year old Niece& she was really pleased with it and played with it straight after opening it on Boxing Day. Can be enjoyed by any age and a great game to take away with you aswell."
8729,2678,5," Great fun for kids and adults alike. My kids played with one of these while my son was waiting for an x ray& both then asked if Santa would bring one. Kept them entertained for hours!"
8730,2678,5," Great fun.....still not yet found the penny very addictive. Nice to see the kids with something other than games console."
8731,2678,5," Great gameHours of funThanks"
8732,2679,5," no problems"
8733,2680,5," These cards are bicycle quality&air cushion finish& and are great for making gaffed cardsI would reccomend this if anyone needed a blank face with a red back pack of cards."
8734,2680,5," These are well made as you would expect from Bicycle and they have a multitude of magical uses. All amateur magicians should have at least one pack of blank cards"
8735,2681,5," This is a lovely deck of cards.  The first Japanese pack my grandson has received.  He loved them& there were 3 mega charizard cards in the pack. They are good quality and fortunately he was still able to tell me the name of each pokemon.  Nice addition to his collection.  They arrived well packaged and in good time."
8736,2681,5," Great set of cards and play deck. My 7 year old loves it. It did take over 3 weeks to arrive& however& it was coming all the way from Japan. Would highly recommend."
8737,2681,5," The cards in this deck have a different feeling than the standard english cards& they feel higher quality. And unlike the standard english theme decks& this comes bundled with two Charizard Ex cards and one M Charizard Y Ex card& something not possible to own unless you get very lucky with english booster packs! Well worth the money to add these cards to your collection."
8738,2681,5," brilliant - comes with playmat and damage counters - agree with other reviews the quality of the cards are higher than the uk ones - but remember can't use these if playing in tournament. - unless you are in Japan I guess.  Different back design and different language"
8739,2681,4," Managed to miss the part of the listing where it said it was the Japanese version.  It is exactly as described& however& when I came back to check the ad.  Fingers crossed my eight year old will still be able to use them."
8740,2681,5," I cannot believe the pulls I got from the boosters inside my pack. Along with the awesome ex's I pulled 2 holes and another 2 ex's funny thing is they were in the same booster! 4 shiny cards. They aren't fake either. Took a while to arrive& about two weeks& only slight issue."
8741,2681,1," Didn't realise when ordering that pack was in Chinese.  Very disappointed little boy when they finally arrived 3 weeks after ordered!"
8742,2681,5," Very happy& the real thing and very fast delivery! Arrived within 3 days."
8743,2682,5," A truly fantastic and very addictive deck building game. Any true gamer will love this game! Think dominion& but much funkier artwork& more fun for lovers of anime& and better game dynamics. The game is truly random& and whilst two player games can be one sided& on occasion& this game blows you away when played by three or more people as the group dynamics and randomness really come into play. There is often a point when one player takes the lead& but it's normally tactics& and then a game sensibly finding a close rapidly& rather than drawing itself out forever& which is actully a very positive thing& and good game design. Expect the quietest person to actually get ahead as they don't make themselves a target... Group dynamics are part of the game in a fun way. Many many hours of fun to be had with this game indeed (my favourite from this years Games Expo in Birmingham& for sure). The other uk review is very harsh... Check out all of the US Amazon reviews which are all great descriptions and reviews of the game!"
8744,2682,4," Bought this on impulse as it was just over a tenner on Amazon and I'm glad i did.  I wasn't expecting too much but this has turned out to be a favourite with the people I play it with and has seen a lot of game time in the last couple of weeks.It isn't the deepest entry in the genre but a good opener or filler game that can be taught quickly and one that moves along at a brisk pace.  I definitely works better with more players& as with 2 it can swing quite widely with some big winning margins.My only negative would be that the card stock used for the decks is awful and barely thicker then paper.  You could sleeve the cards& I didn't and they do look a bit battered already..."
8745,2682,5," A game of card collecting (there is a name for the typology) that changes everytime you play it.Very stimulating.Probably not suitable for the easily offended due to names of the characters on the cards.  But this is their loss"
8746,2682,5," Great game. Nice and simple to play."
8747,2683,4," I wanted a pack of cards for using in magic tricks and have found better cards with an air cushion finish which work better for card fanning.Overall& thay are a good pack of standard playing cards."
8748,2683,4," I was looking for double index cards and found this& I also have the Viena double deck (from the same brand) but this deck is better in quality.Maybe not so good as Bicycle Standard because the side of the cards and the slide but overall& it has good quality.I have left handed people in the family and playing cards is dificult because of the indexes so I won't be using this very often yet I won't keep myself from using it."
8749,2683,5," Good quality cards& no frills just the basic thing. You get one pack& either red or blue."
8750,2683,4," good playing cards"
8751,2684,4," Great top trumps card game& just falls foul to clumsy toddlers hands due to the flimsy ness of normal playing cards."
8752,2684,5," These cards are brilliant even though my son is only 4"
8753,2684,5," Father Christmas brought these and the DVD so this is a great way to remember the names of all of the characters. A great little game to pop in your travel bag."
8754,2684,5," Bought for my 4 year old& good quality& plays with them a bit but think he'll enjoy them more when he's a bit older!"
8755,2684,5," bought for xmas present for my god son and he loves them& always wanting to play them with his dad and brother"
8756,2685,5," A fantastic set filled with some really great cards& not only are you guaranteed a quasar but i managed to pull a Red-dragon archfiend and T.G Halberd cannon. All in all a great set and well worth the Â£20."
8757,2685,5," Both arrived on time and my friends were happy with their purchases. The boosters seem to favour Nordic monsters since both of them had a Loki and Odin in them."
8758,2685,5," I have bought this two times and both have been great filled with some fantastic cards& I got a mist wurm& power tool dragon& life stream dragon and two goyo guardians with so much more.I have to say 5 stars"
8759,2685,5," This is fantasticIn this box I got many great cards which when added up in value cost well over 50 pounds I pulled 2 Goyo guardians a shooting star dragon red nova red dragon archfiend stardust majestic star t.g blade blaster emergency teleport and many others plus your guaranteed to get quasar and black rose all in all you cant go wrong"
8760,2685,5," it had lots of good cards in it but no stardust"
8761,2685,5," Great pack with great cards only hope I get a red dragon archfied second time round though but first time I had a stardust dragon and loads of black winged cards but not a red dragon archfied"
8762,2685,5," Verry nice! and on time!"
8763,2685,5," grandson pleased"
8764,2686,5," Great fun making up sentences with picture and word cards. Play lasts as long as you want it and does not get boring as the kid's are laughing all the time. Well recommended."
8765,2686,5," Very quick service really happy A*"
8766,2686,5," Excellent for home teaching."
8767,2687,5," Brilliant cards"
8768,2687,5," Great item"
8769,2687,5," great gift"
8770,2688,4," Son absolutely loves this.  Special request from 10 year old for Christmas and he's possibly got his money's worth from it!"
8771,2689,5," Bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it! Loads of fun with the app but to be honest you can just download the app and play it with a normal set of monopoly deal& there is no difference and it would save you some money especially if you already own a set"
8772,2689,5," Just a perfect game. Best played with 3 players (in my opinion& and handles 2-5)& very portable. I usually play an open handed game to get all the rules across to new players (this is the hardest part) but everyone has loved it once they've got going. These are my 3rd and 4th decks because I occasionally give them away as gifts to people who enjoy it."
8773,2689,4," Played this with some friends who had a set enjoyed it much better and faster than board game loses a point because no instructions or rules on how to play the game. Had to get a photo copy of rules from friend who introduced me to it."
8774,2689,5," Brilliant game and takes a lot less time to play than the board gameMy son loves it"
8775,2689,4," I have had so many fun nights with this game and shorter than monopoly and more transportable. Once you and your friend get a grip of this game then it boils down to luck instead of strategy."
8776,2689,5," This is such a fun game! Based on the board game monopoly but more fast paced and interesting. You still have to collect the streets& stations and utility sets and its the first to get three sets who wins.  You have money too and can be charged rent etc. but there are cards in the pack which can be played that may cause you to have to swap& sell or give up your properties. Its a great game of strategy but it doesn't take days to play.(only minutes)  We play it with the kids& age 4 and 7 and together on our own. Nice and compact its great to play anywhere& easy to learn and a great gift to give to someone else."
8777,2689,5," Bought as a gift for a friend who loves this game and insists we play it at every opportunity& comes in a handy little case and cards are very well presented with large print and nice wipe-able material. The game itself is usually met with a degree of prejudice& as monopoly is infamous for taking years and ruining friendships& while the latter still may occur with this game it is a quick and easy card game! Really easy to teach to others and highly addictive!"
8778,2689,5," Absolutely LOVE Monopoly Deal& played it once and was hooked... It is so much quicker than a board game which makes it more interesting to play and makes you think so much more. Only problem is that it can be quite complicated(when you are learning the rules) and I personally find it difficult to teach it to friends. But it is amazing and always giving it away to friends for birthday and Christmas presents."
8779,2690,5," The cards are excellent quality and not only look beautiful& but also feel really nice to handle. They have a good rigidity to them and have a slightly glossy& but textured& finish. These are my second pack of Bicycle cards as the first pack vanished after a party (not surprised as they are quality cards). The finish on the cards looks like it would be easy to wipe them clean if needed& though I have not spilt anything on them& and don't intend to. Even the box they come in is good quality and durable."
8780,2690,5," The Bicycle Vintage |Dragon Back| Deck is a really smart looking pack but in Gold it looks terrific.The Court cards have a great look with a toned metallic green which looks- well regal.Of course the big attraction is the card backs which it is reputed is an old design filed and forgotten for years then rediscovered by a worker at Bicycle.They like the design and chose to release it to the public.This is an attractive and impressive deck for magicians the sheen looks really professional.Certainly when I use it for tricks it really gets the trick off to a good start if you have a great looking deck like this.The red dragons give and Oriental air of mystery so to speak.The 'Tarot' card referred to is in actual fact a 'Gaff' card.It's double backed so nothing to write home about but an extra which is always welcome.The back includes a couple of 'Trade' cards which are always useful if you need to make your own Gaffs.In actions the cards perform well.They fan out and are easily manipulated as are all Bicycle brands. The airflow ensures the slide easily.I used to used 'Bee' brand for many years. Bee are a subsidiary of Bicycle but I must admit I prefer to use Bicycle.A really smart looking deck that performs well.The cards are also available in Blue& Red& Green. Yellow and Gold."
8781,2690,5," I love this pack. It looks great and handles really well (having said that& the |air-cushion finish| was a bit slippy to begin with). I love the muted colour of the red pips and the back is gorgeous.Came in decent time& too."
8782,2690,5," This is a really good deck of cards& good quality detail on the back. This was my first pack of decent quality professional playing cards and i am very impressed with them"
8783,2690,5," Recently purchased these for my amateur card tricking japery& I'm getting better I swear! At first I was a little sceptical about the whole 'air cushioned' business& but the difference is there. The cards are ever so 'slippy' against each other& making spreading the deck and fanning it very easy. In comparison to Waddingtons& they just feel far more well made. The dragon back decal is rather impressive as well.Overall& a cracking deck."
8784,2690,5," Bicycle Gold Dragon Deck Playing Cards lovely pack of cards superb quality well made and the design is simply stunning"
8785,2690,4," Purchased for my wife as she likes to play solitaire& but not on the p.c.! She would rather use the real thing& lovely quality cards that are silky smooth in play just like they used to be before everything was manufactured using  cheap cardboard. Love them."
8786,2690,4," They look great and handle well& not much more you can ask for! Only downside is that with delivery they are slightly expensive& but it's worth paying more to get a respected brand."
8787,2691,4," As far as I see it there are two main good reasons to buy this deck both valid:1st: You enjoy playing the game but you want to expand the experience and invite 2 other friends to play. Perhaps it's not essential to buy this add-on to go from four to a six players game& although it will considerably improves experience in my opinion& and solves some limited amount of specific cards issue.2nd: Or you want to get some new characters for you and your friends to try& and also some extra boons and banes. Expanding your experience even if you are playing it solo.I bought it for both reasons to get an extra player and increase the amount of characters available.Perhaps if I didn't have extra players to invite I would've postponed acquiring this until after I got more adventure decks.Yet I'm quite happy that I did& some of new characters easily are among my favourite and have an extra friend at the table& can't go wrong with& unless it's a tiny table"
8788,2691,5," Loving this - it's basically a card-based dungeon-crawl (even though the locations are many and varied and not restricted to dungeons).  Assemble your party& create the locations using the Adventure and Scenario cards and then go monster slaying& loot gathering and Villain-hunting.Has a really well thought out 'timer' mechanism that means it doesn't matter if you play solo or with friends - or create a party where you control all the heroes. The game lasts for the same amount of play-time (marked by flipping a card from a  deck of 30 to show each character's turn).If you like D"
8789,2691,2," Got Chinese print cards to go with my US printed base game. Different size and colour palette. Doesn't shuffle properly when card size differs.. Not amazons fault I suppose. Do I just keep purchasing until a US set gets sent ?"
8790,2691,5," Easy to learn& simple mechanics but great feel to a boardgame. Each game is totally different and the play balance is great& recommend to anyone who is interested in boardgame or RPG"
8791,2691,4," Product arrived promptly& no dinks& tears or scratches& a great addition to a fun game. I would recommend this to anyone who has purchased the base game."
8792,2692,5," the cards came in a well packed parcel and when open i was surprised by the quality and the size of these A4 size full deck of playing cards. ideal for parties and fun for chidren. excellent service and postage"
8793,2692,5," Great buy.  Bought it for mad hatters tea party to play |higher or lower|. I'm sure this will be brilliant."
8794,2692,4," Purchased 2 packs of these cards for an upcoming cruise& as I like the idea of our group of 8 sitting on a cruise ship playing with a huge deck of cards& although I haven't told the others yet!Slightly disappointed the cards are NOT in fact UK A4 size& despite the product headline. They resemble the American equivalent& which I think is referred to as 'Letter' size. Also slightly disappointed by the fact that one pack had damaged corners& despite what appeared to be good packaging& so I'm guessing they may have got dropped at some point prior to despatch.Despite these fairly trivial disappointments& they will easily serve the purpose they were bought for and in case you're wondering& there are also 2 Joker cards included per pack. Would buy again& unless accurate A4-sized cards were specifically required."
8795,2692,5," Purchased to use on a home made Play Your Cards Right gameThe board is 7 foot tall and thought that these may be too small but as it turns out just right.Good quality and bright colours.Good Value"
8796,2692,5," Large giant playing cards. these were just what I was looking for. when I have finished using them I shall pass them on to a care home for their use."
8797,2692,5," These giant cards are great i bought them to use in care setting and they are ideal for games such as play your cards right and they are great for people who have difficulty holding things due to medical problems.They are also good for people who may have sight problems the print is bold and the colours are bright they are ideal for my use and i would strongly recommend this product to people who organise activities in a care setting or in schools also great value for money."
8798,2692,5," It is a game for our family Christmas Day.  I am hosting dinner this year and this game will be excellent after all the turkey and trimmings.I am never disappointed with amazon goods and I always trust the viewing.  Pictures are what I expect and not made bigger to sell product.Thank you amazon"
8799,2692,5," Ordered these for a group of visually impaired adults so they could play games without struggling to see. They are perfect and have been used at every session since we purchased them..The plastic coating keeps them clean and they slide off the pack very easily."
8800,2693,5," Good fun :') especially for someone who mumbles"
8801,2694,3," These paper figures are good fun to make and my son enjoyed them as a present.  However& I do find the product over-prized."
8802,2694,5," Orderd for christmas only two came as i had to wait for the other came after christmas sons still putting together ."
8803,2695,5," bought as a present for an avid card player and it was a great success.  The constantly changing rules are great fun& although it takes a little while to get used to the concept and occasional discussion to ensure everyone interprets the rules the same way."
8804,2696,5," A cute box for my sons cards. The box will easily hold 200 plus cards.The cards were basic and out of the 50& my son recognized 2. He was happy with them as they're his first cards and he still doesn't quite know what to do with them.The shiny/special cards are okay too - nothing too fancy& but again& they're good for first time buyers who don't already have a collection going.Highly recommended for a first pack of cards and the box definitely comes in handy."
8805,2696,4," I chose this particular item because I wanted to continue collecting PokÃ©mon cards which I have saved for a couple of years now.However& I was a slight bit disappointed when I found the booster pack cards were mostly from more recent card sets rather than the actual ones from when the tin was first issued.But on the other hand& I did manage to get a rare Manaphy card which I have been searching for since 2009 which is from the generation I am collecting at the moment.In the future& the product needs more specification as to what the booster packs are actually called. |50 trading cards including Holos and Rares| isn't really specific enough for me."
8806,2696,3," The tin was in bad condition when i recieved it and alot of the cards were common to uncommon with maybe one rare card& not a good starter set but lucky for me it had some cards i happened to be looking for& anyone interested in filling out some blanks in their collection or simply just want to accumulate more cards this is a more cost effective way method rather than buying six booster packs the condition of the cards where near mint and i can't fault that at all but all the weak monsters i got really made me consider returning the product also the lack of any trainer or energy cards annoyed me. I'd reccomend booster packs instead because the pokemon in them varry greatly in strength& type and rarity but if you really don't wanna spend 24 pounds then pick this up maybe the seller might be a little more mad than mine was. Still cheers for the vaporeon mate XD"
8807,2696,5," I bought this for my nephew as he loves pokemon& the range of cards is really good and the case they come in is lovely& cards are slightly bent but otherwise in great condition. Would recommend for any pokemon fan. Can't wait to see his face :)"
8808,2696,2," The package arrived next day recored delivery ! All very impressive however the tin has scratches on and some marks which i have been  able to wipe off& this not what i expected. I can't comment on the cards but my young boys are extremely happy and have not even noticed the scratches on the tin. Personally believe the seller should have made it should clearer that the tin was not new and perhaps the cards too have been opened and used too? If i had wanted second hand tin i would have gone to e-bay. never the less the purpose of happy children has been achieved& so it could be worse."
8809,2696,1," I received the product in hope but was disappointed to find it wasn't new at all. The seal was missing and once we (my boyfriend and I) had scanned through he informed me that the cards"
8810,2696,4," The box is very usefull to tiddy up all the cardsBehind the pack they said there is EX Cards inside the pack but they were not. So my daughter wasn't happy for that..I didn't take the time to check what was written and specify behind the pack."
8811,2696,5," Bought this for my daughter& she absolutely loves it. It arrived promptly and is vey well packaged. They 'shiney' cards come in protective sleeves which is amazing. Didn't receive any duplicates too!"
8812,2697,5," As expected"
8813,2698,1," they were bought for kids and there were mostly pictures of old players they had never heard of"
8814,2698,5," Brilliant cards.  I got them for the Chelsea badge on the back of the cards not realising that the cards actually have the players details on the front& rather that the usual number of diamonds& spades etc.  Really great for football fans."
8815,2698,5," speedy service& It was a gift for a Chelsea fan who absolutely loved them. It was a fantastic buy. Would recommend to all those chelsea fans as it is a brilliant gift."
8816,2698,5," purchased for an English friend in Turkey who is a mad Chelsed supporter.I was pleased with look&he is thrilled now he has them and has looked at"
8817,2698,5," nicely packaged and each card has a different player from past and present& my son was well pleased with these as a stocking filler at christmas!"
8818,2698,3," nice set of playing cards if you are a cfc fan& i am not a football fan but my partner likes this. speedy delivery."
8819,2698,5," i bought this as a present for a stocking filler. i am sure he will love them and they will get plenty of use."
8820,2699,4," Arrived on time and as described.  My son has so many darn cards& we needed to put them somewhere& I may well be buying another...."
8821,2700,5," Skip-Bo is a game that can be enjoyed by all the family& whatever their age. In fact& my 6 year old taught me how to play it. This game seems very difficult to get hold of in the UK& which explains why the instructions are not in English. Whatever language they are in& we are very grateful to Annikhali for selling it via Amazon. For a set of instructions in English& simply Google |Skip-Bo Instructions| and you will be able to find them without any problems at all. In an age of insula computers and games& I would thoroughly recommend this game as a way of periodically bringing the family back together for some fun. We all love it!"
8822,2700,5," This game was introduced to the family by the grandparents six months ago. We had  already been  hooked on Rummy-o  for two years and didn't need a new game& but they claimed Skip Bo was even better?! Not likely& -but we had to give it a go and the rest is history! Skip Bo is for the entire family the best game ever. You can take it with you every were and you can even decide  approximately how long the game will last. So there will always be time for a quick game.We have never taken much interest in games in this family& but we make an exception for Skip Bo& and Rummy-o which is now a good number two. Both games are played several times a week by the whole family& aged 6 -86. Excellent value for money!Got to go& the next door neighbour is demanding a game of Skip Bo!"
8823,2700,5," Tghis game is not available in UK shops. Scouring the internet brought it up at Amazon. Delivery very prompt from germany and well packaged. It is an excellent game (but nobody has any control over that). I have devised a variation that you may like after trying the standard game. Make two of the piles start with 12 and count down while the other two as standard start at 1 and count up. Another variation& when any pile gets to 6 (going up or down) the person to next play chooses whether to play the next correct card or change direction and lay the appropriate card. This decision is made at the point of play not in advance. It certainly add fun. You may need to mark the piles up/down unless you all have a brilliant memory and wish to avoid claims that the pile was going not down!! Have fun."
8824,2700,3," I bought this card game as I had played it with friends however when supplied the rules were not in English& I requested a copy in English but got no reply from the company supplying them. If I did not know the rules from friends this game woud have been totally useless."
8825,2700,2," We had already played this game a year ago but the rules are important. The product came with NO english rules so we have NOT BEEN ABLE TO PLAY the game with our grandchildren. They enjoy UNO and would have enjoyed SKIP BO if there had been english instructions."
8826,2700,5," This has got to be the best game ever& it can be spiteful& frustrating&and annoying all at the.same time& it doesn't matter how one shuffles the cards it's just amazing how they will come out in runs& or all one type all together& brilliant brilliant game"
8827,2700,5," after playing skip-bo with friends I purchased the game for myself and for a relation.Very pleased with price and product and speed of posting.In future would definately recommend others to purchase their own cards this way."
8828,2700,5," fab product - only warning is you will totally addicted to it so will stay up late at night!  really enjoyed over Christmas and introduced to about 12 other people!!  Should I get commission ???? definitely recommend."
8829,2701,4," I have been using Bicycle cards for many years now.Why?They simply are one of the best decks and perform really well.Bicycle cards have an air flow finish and they glide and fan really well.This means they are wonderful to handle.They fan out and are easily manipulated as are all Bicycle brands.The airflow ensures the slide easily.I used to used 'Bee' brand for many years. Bee are a subsidiary of Bicycle but I must admit I prefer to use Bicycle.If you take some of the best 'plastic coated' brands and compare you will feel a massive difference in how they play.The others stick together and seem to get grubbier more quickly. The surfaces are frankly rubbish.Bicycle always outperform them and even the oldest Bicycle deck will knock the spots of the other  brand new ones. (if you will pardon the expression?)I am an amateur magician and in my experience Bicyclecards are the best.Now  to the Nautic pack.It is just a bog standard basic Bicycle pack- nothing too bad about that great handling& air flow etc except the backs- in this case are just black on white.No borders no colour 52 cards two Jokers and a trade card.No Gaffs No extras what so ever.The design is scrolled but plain.Now for the same price you can get much better and colourful packs- for example the dragon backswhich are really special.Bicycle Vintage |Dragon Back| Deck with Gaff Card RedEven the normal Bicycle Blue or Reds come with a simple Gaff card and are cheaper.Read more â€º"
8830,2702,5," i 5 starred this as i am very pleased with the product as i pulled 2 ex cards (not including the yveltal ex promo) and a holo victini. Would recommend to anyone who just wants to add a few new cards to their collection."
8831,2702,5," Brilliant! I got some really great pulls as it comes with very good packs! Would definitely recommend to someone who is into pokemon cards. The packing was good and it also came two days early. Would definitely buy from again!"
8832,2702,5," amazing and has an amazing value I mean you get a ex card a tin (with great art work) and four packs of pokemon cards I got great ones and in my first pack I opened I got a kyurem EX so by it !!!!!!!!!!!!"
8833,2702,5," This tin appealed to me as I have been away from Pokemon for a long while and wanted to get back into collecting.The Promo card is well packed and arrived in excellent condition. There is a variety of booster packs inside and I 'pulled' a secret rare - rare candy from one. I wasn't disappointed. There is a code in each pack so you can redeem booster packs on the online version of the game and a bonus code in the pack too. I highly recommend this tin to any Pokemon enthusiasts."
8834,2702,5," I bought this from Amazon& and I'm really happy with the product: received the blue Xerneas tin (the one my daughter wanted!) and she said she found some really good cards in it. Good quality& would definitely recommend."
8835,2702,4," This was bought as a birthday present for my grandson. He is very pleased with it. The cards had nice finish  on them& as I'm sure all Pokemon fans will know. He is pleased that he can play online."
8836,2702,5," Got it pretty soon after ordering and was pretty happy with what I got. Was an alright haul as I got 2 EX cards (Yveltal and W-Kyurem). Plenty of Holographic cards so this is definitely a wise purchase if you're starting to collect cards.For anyone who is an avid collector of the cards& here's some helpful info- The tin cover card (Xerneas/Yveltal EX) is a part of a promo set& not the X/Y card set. Only difference between the two is just the card image.- The boosters in my tin are 2x X/Y Boosters 1x Legendary Treasure booster and 1x Plasma Blast. Not sure if it'll be the same in other tins& but still some info I think might be helpful"
8837,2702,5," Exactly what it says on the tin. My little brother was really happy to have received an Yveltal card and I just liked all the colours and shiny stuff."
8838,2703,4," Great card deck! It just looks absolutely amazing& nothing like i have ever seen before! The colour contrast between black with red and grey is just brilliant!The only thing i found a bit weird was the fact that they are a bit slippery - in the sense that they hardly want to stay in one place. Its not too bad as you'll get used to it I'm sure.But other that that get one of these you will amaze you and your mates with how unique this deck is& trust me."
8839,2703,5," My son bought these as he is interested in doing a spot of magic and specifically& card tricks. He likes the smooth finish of this pack as it allows slick movements and therefore a better presentation. A good buy for a magician of any level."
8840,2703,4," First of all these cards look amazing& seriously the design on the back is stunning and the red pips and court card smoke design looks awesome and the slight fade on the pips& would be nicer if there was a heavier fade though. out of the box they handle amazingly& so smooth& after a few weeks of using mine seem to stick a little while trying to do fans& I think it can be sorted& being black cards the edges wear a little and show white but its nothing serious. Overall looks brilliant and good for doing magic but might not last that long."
8841,2703,5," An absolute must for anyone performing with cards. The cards have an amazing finish making them guide effortlessly over each other.Perfect for fanning and other effects. The stock of the card is quality enough for you to apply the extra grip required to the cards in place while handling. Not only a dream to use but the art work is amazing& I haven't had a single person not comment on how cool they are. On top of that the Joker is a nice surprise.Highly recommend& great value."
8842,2703,2," I know there are a lot of positive reviews about this product& but here what i think about these cards.The delivery was fast but then again I paid more than the cards for the next day delivery. Got from seller magicnevinI had googled the ellusionist website and saw all the  |wow| cards and was excited to order the&. But as soon as i received& my first reaction was |shoot& these are fake|.The print quality is not |High quality as described everywhere| Ok it's fine about the print quality. But then the quality of the paper isn't too great. One proper shuffle and i could see the creases.All in all& i think these cards would've been really good if they were a) plastic or similar so they don't crease when shuffling. and b) were printed in high quality design.I suppose these are good for magic tricks or playing where light shuffling is ok. The quality however disappointed me seeing how the website and all woed me by showing how amazing the cards are."
8843,2703,5," lovely deck of card. great quality feel to them so i know they will last. highly recommend. plus they look so cool compared to normal cards. quick delivery also."
8844,2703,5," Grandson has aspirations to become the next Dynamo and favours this make of cards.  They arrived promptly and are very good quality and value."
8845,2703,5," My son bought these& they are beautifully made and very dramatically illustrated. He was able to handle them well for magic which is their purpose& but not too easy to see as a 'playing' deck. Lovely product for purpose though& he was delighted with them."
8846,2704,3," Questions are dated and of their time& looking for a question set that also covers modern  subjects of the last twenty years."
8847,2704,5," Great value for 5 pence.  Good seller"
8848,2704,5," Great& thankyou."
8849,2704,5," I was impressed by the speed of delivery and the condition of the cards.Something I have wanted for years so delighted to find them."
8850,2705,4," Fun Game for the whole family& simple to pick up& very easy to learn and fun with some subtleties! Each round is very quick and games take 10-20 minutes to play completely.Game is the same a Alderac Entertainment Group Love Letter Adventure Time Clamshell Edition Cards but that version has a nice bag to put cards and stuff into."
8851,2705,5," Love this"
8852,2706,4," this is a lovely gift for any gruffalo lover&the tin and cards are great but for a younger child some of the cards are a bit simalar to tell the difference."
8853,2706,4," These cards are beautifully illustrated and come in a lovely tin but my four year old struggles to play snap because some cards have same picture and coloured background but different words written on them. Lovely for an older child though and my son still loves them&"
8854,2706,5," Great big strong cards and in a tin. Wonderful for my grandson who has some special needs& but can read the words on the cards.Highly recommended"
8855,2706,5," Excellent set of playing cards for a 3year old who loves the Gruffalo. Made of good strong laminated card with a strong tin for storage."
8856,2706,4," Brilliant game& and if your child likes the Gruffalo they will certainly like this game!"
8857,2706,5," Our kids love this and have played it LOTS!"
8858,2707,5," Added to the box."
8859,2708,5," Item arrived as expected on time"
8860,2709,5," Excellent"
8861,2710,4," My boyfriend loved them and is constantly showing friends and family magic tricks with them"
8862,2710,5," I love old unique playing cards these are great"
8863,2710,5," Partner loved them"
8864,2711,5," Nice playing cards& lovely photos.  Thank you!"
8865,2712,5," I am not a huge fan of tabletop game but someone gave this to me as a gift.I became a fan instantly and insisted we play quite a few rounds in one go. This is a simple yet intriguing games with many surprises.I've brought it out during a few game nights and everyone has loved it as well."
8866,2712,5," I just loved this game! I am taking the box in my bag all the time to play it on the beach& pool or bar! Great entertainment for chill times with friends and family! Very competitive and challenging!"
8867,2713,5," How 16 cards can make such a fun game is almost amazing& but this gets played with our children more than almost any other game we have& due to playing quickly& but also having a nice level of deduction and bluffing.Plays 2-4 players& but much better with 3 or 4 than 2. And our 8 year old loves it and regularly beats us!"
8868,2713,5," Fun& thought provoking& curious and extremely addictive! Even my 14yr old son likes this game. Takes a while to get the hang of the different cards and their effects but each round can be quite quick and the winner is the first to obtain a set number of |tokens of affection|. Comes in a lovely red drawstring bag and the cards are beautifully illustrated. Only down side is the plastic bag the tokens come in. Ideal time to decorate a matchbox to hold them. Bling it up is what I say."
8869,2713,5," It's not often that a simple card game gets replayed in my gaming group so often& but Love Letter is certainly one that has joined that select class of filler games.The objective of the game is simple& you want to either eliminate your opponents by playing action cards or retain the card with the highest number at the end of the game.Mechanically it is a simple 16 card game involving playing the best cards you can on your turn and deducing what each opponent has in his hand by observing the cards that have been played. Most games will take 3-5 minutes with an additional minute if you have to explain the rules and what the cards do.Because of its small size it fits perfectly as a game that you can either carry it around with you and pop it out for a quick game with your friends or as a filler game in between other larger and longer games. I would also recommend it as a good starter game if you're looking to introduce casual/non gamers due to its fun value and simplicity."
8870,2713,5," When my mate first described this game to us and brought out the red velvet sack we all dismissed it immediately. It just seemed too silly and not a theme that we wanted to play |fighting over the affection of a princess|. The mechanics also seemed ridiculous& just pick up a card and play one until you're out or no cards are left? It felt like a card game your grandmother would teach you on a wet afternoon when you were 8.A year or 2 on and hardly a games session goes by without us playing this game. It's super fast and light - perfect to play while waiting for someone or in between big games like a sorbet between courses to cleanse your palette. It's easy to pick up and has a bit of strategy to it despite the simple game mechanics. We also find ourselves getting into the spirit of the theme which adds to the fun and makes us laugh. The size of it also makes it perfect to take with you on trips for a quick game on holiday or as an ice breaker.In summary I can't recommend this game enough to have in your collection."
8871,2713,5," Who knew 16 cards and 13 little red cubes could become such a great game? It's fast and frantic& and hilarities are sure to ensue. Each round requires a player to pick up a new card and then discard a card& all the while trying to keep your identity hidden& go for big numbers& and find out (and eliminate) the other players. Turns plays out differently from game to game& but each time& just as you're starting to get an idea of who has what and how to beat them& the round ends! It's great! Don't get me wrong& you're paying for the idea here& as the contents of the game are very minimal& but it's hard to find a better card game for the money."
8872,2713,5," This is a brilliant game! I've noticed a few people asking if it's suitable for younger children eg 5yrs. My 6 and a half year old ( pretty average ability I'd say) may not have been ready at 5 but now it's by far and away her favourite game and she can't play it enough. It's easy to pick up after a few plays and I don't think reading ability is a problem as the picture characters are easy to recognise. It's quick to play and has enough subtlety and depth to keep adult players from being bored. It's great that it can be played by 2 players alone or up to 4. A compact portable gem"
8873,2713,5," I recomend this game even for starters& even if you don't play board games& its realy simple to play even if you not understand english very well& its 16 cars divided into 8 difrent& very easy mecanics& very adictive"
8874,2713,5," I love this game. Its short its simple and engaging.Everyone I've played this with has learnt within minutes and been enjoying themselves for the entirety of the game.The only hurdle to get new players over is the name and theme of the game.I got this out as a suggestion to play with a small group of male friends and it took a lot of fast talking to get them to consider it.So my advice is ignore the Theme and Name& if you want a short and sweet play out of the bag Bluff game& this is the game for you!"
8875,2714,3," Decent enough& the cards in the set are good but actually pulling decent cards is hard.Okay set for price"
8876,2714,5," Great daughter so happy"
8877,2714,5," As advertised"
8878,2715,4," Standard adventure pack for Lord of the Rings LCG. New scenario& hero and player cards.Have just played the scenario once and really like the new Valour mechanism.Excellent service from Amazon& arrived within 24 hours of placing the order."
8879,2716,5," Great value for money.  Not sure why they are sold as German Version they seem to be exactly the same as those I have bought in UK.  The postage is much greater than the cost of the sleeves but still works out much cheaper than those sold by other UK suppliers.  Recommend"
8880,2716,4," Does the job. Used for keeping playing cards undamaged in love letter. Fits perfectly but the hologram needs to be on the face side as its not in the same place on each cover. If you put the hologram I. The back side on the card you can learn which card is which."
8881,2717,4," The timeline series is a fun little game for the end of the night& or even as a small after dinner game. Everyone gets a card with a picture and an event named on it. They take it in turns to place that event into the timeline (made up of previous correctly laid events)& if you get it wrong draw a new event. The winner is the first to place all of their cards.The cinema theme has an interesting selection of pieces of music and films& and is probably a good set to engage teenagers. The artwork can be amusing at times."
8882,2717,5," We had so much fun with this game. Would highly recommend. The artwork on the cards is exquisite too. I bought as a gift for a film buff."
8883,2717,5," Good family game...got all the older members reminiscing!"
8884,2717,5," Such a fun game& I normally hate any |board game| but this I am addicted to!"
8885,2717,5," A++"
8886,2718,5," First they got delivered very quickly and the case and all the cards were in brand new condition.Anyone who's familiar with Top Trumps knows that they're real fun for either two people or a group to play and can pass time quickly when your not doing much or just traveling and this Bond pack is true to that.Almost all the cards have been chosen very well in my opinion except a small couple that are a little boring and could have been replaced by better characters for example 'Nick Nack' and 'Tee Hee' could have been replaced with Brad Whitaker from 'The Living Daylights' or Valentine Zukovski from 'Goldeneye' but this might be just picking as most of the well known and great ones are in the pack such as -Goldfinger& Jaws& Max Zorin and all the different Bonds from the first(George Lazenby) to most recent(Daniel Craig).Above is ratings for fun& durability and educational value& Top Trumps are more of a time passing toy so can't really call them a toy or educational but they are fun and can be used almost anywhere.I've played one or two games with family and had a bit of fun so overall happy with these Top Trumps& I'd recommend to any Top Trumps or Bond fan."
8887,2718,3," My son was delighted with this game as he is a James Bond fanatic but it was ridiculously expensive for what it is."
8888,2718,3," I bought this game for my godson who is 8 and into james bond. I hope he will like it. I am a bit disappointed with regards to the characters in the game. They have left out Drax (moonraker)& Kananga (live and let die) and Sanchez (Licence to kill) and general Orlov(Octopussy) Also left out Anya Amasova(the spy who loved me) and Sheriff Peppar (Live and let die& man with the golden gun). These great villains and allies should have been included in my opinion."
8889,2718,5," Great product& great price. Quickly sent. Great for Bond fans or Top Trump fans of all ages. Ideal as a stocking filler."
8890,2718,5," Great kids game& you can while away an afternoon playing this game great for all. James Bond makes it extra special."
8891,2718,5," Brilliant top trumps. Great fun for older ones too who still want to play top trumps with kids. Would Def buy again."
8892,2718,5," My 12 year old nephew is James Bond crazy. I bought these Top Trumps as a stocking filler for Christmas and he was delighted. I don't think that he's ever seen Top Trumps before& but was really taken by them.The case is solid& the cards are well printed& colourful and full of interesting James Bond facts.A hit!"
8893,2718,5," Bought these cards for my nephew for his birthday& as he loves top trumps and is just discovering Bond.Went down a treat& and has had endless fun with them thus far.Bug thumbs up."
8894,2719,5," My three year old loves cars and anything with wheels on so this kept him interested in the game a lot longer than other games he has got."
8895,2719,5," Educational and fun... a number of different pairing games can be played with this set including snap.My 3 year old grandson and I would recommend them as they are colourful& robust& very cheap and not too big for small hands."
8896,2719,5," My grandson just loves this and it's helping him with vocabulary& numbers and colours.Can recommend this for any age from around 2."
8897,2719,5," Great game to play for the whole family& grandsons are both into computer games & so this is something different to do with them"
8898,2719,4," These are nicely illustrated& and feel of good quality. And at this price an absolute bargain& so it doesn't hurt to buy them"
8899,2719,5," My grandson loves these cards!  Anthing with a car or tractor...... Great game& and he has a fantastic memory for playing pairs!"
8900,2719,5," bought this for my nephew as an add on to his birthday present& he loves playing with them and loves the fact they are wheels!"
8901,2719,1," I know these cards are fab as I was trying to replace a lost pack... however& we received a 'hot wheels notepad' !!!???!!!"
8902,2720,5," If the original Uno card game wasn't enough for you then take a look at this. It's more fun with the new 'Downpour' card& which can make ALL players or teams have to pick up an extra 1 or 2 cards& not just the next player& and the best plus to this new version is that it's waterproof! OK& so most of us don't play Uno in the bath or swimming pool& but these new plastic playing cards are incredibly durable& won't bend (unless you force them) and just look so cool even your teenagers are going to want to play.I would recommend this very affordable& very durable and very very cool game to all ages& from 5 - 105!"
8903,2720,5," These cards are great for little mucky fingers.  The picture shown is not the H2O cards as some of each card is see through.  The only negative thing to say& which really isn't much& is that because they are plastic& when on a pile& they can slip off easily.  Great cards& feel nice to hold and come in a plastic case to hold them all."
8904,2720,5," simple advice - buy thembrilliant for holidays etcthe kids love the fact they are 'see through'"
8905,2720,4," Great game.  Glad I already knew the rules as they were in German!!  Hence only 4 stars."
8906,2720,5," Good quality& proper packiging and it arrived earlier than expected :)"
8907,2721,5," The Metal Horse  Bicycle Deck was released to celebrate the Year of The Horse in 2014.(So the cards were actually published in 2013)They really are an elegant looking pack.If you want to know what the other  'Horse' years were so that you may give the pack as a thoughtful gift  they were"
8908,2721,5," Great design on the cards handles well"
8909,2722,5," This is the 2nd game of this I have bought as the old one got grubby through over-use! It is a very simple idea and needs very little organising. Equally good for children and aldults as you could make up your own categories. Educational again if you add your own categories. Good cheap fun!"
8910,2722,5," We found this game in our holiday cottage in France.  Had to buy it when we got home.  Fun for all ages."
8911,2722,5," This is a really good game& quick and simple without loads of rules. It is like a card version of Scattigories. Great to take on holiday too as small and lightweight."
8912,2722,5," Very good family game &handy size box for travelling&no batteries needed so a big  bonus seemed to amuse old and young of both sexes"
8913,2722,4," After playing with extended family we decided to purchase a copy for my son who has just started university. It has been used several times and is great for a cheap fun evening. Lots of laughs."
8914,2722,5," Good game and can span the ages. Quite simple to understand and get going. Easy to adapt time or number of subjects to fit ability and concentrati span of players. Think.will become favourite family game for holidays etc."
8915,2722,4," Played once so far but enjoyable little game"
8916,2722,3," Good value&tidy package for an old game. Just as much fun as it used to be. Nothing new apart from the box."
8917,2723,2," The item fits the description. The box looks like its been through a tornado. It has been opened previously I believe or it is just a really old box and they reused it. Would have appreciated if it was stated it was used instead of NEW.On the bright side the cards look new and I'll be having lots of fun."
8918,2723,5," Great& fun& quick game to play!"
8919,2723,5," Good game. Came quickly."
8920,2723,5," good game"
8921,2723,1," Thought it was the English version"
8922,2724,5," A lovely pack featuring 27 + cats. The 3 are LOL cats& Tiger and a cartoon cat. The LOL Cats feature a cat sat at a computer& the carton cat contains& you guessed it& a cartoon image. The rest of the cards however contain a beautiful photographic image. Incidentally& the final odd one out is a stray cat. The cards contain the following information. The country of origin& a cat fact and another paragraph about the breed. Categories are Size& Rarity& Good Temper& Cuteness and Top Trump Rating. One thing I do like is the fact that you can play this pack with the Dogs pack (q.v.) One final thought& regarding the cartoon cat. In Dogs the cartoon character is Scooby Doo& so instead of having a relatively unkown character representing cats& I would've preferred good old TC. All in all though& a fantastic pack."
8923,2724,1," Awful! I love cats and I love top trumps. But some of the facts were completely inaccurate. For example& bengals are not american& they are part Asian snow leopard& the clue is in the name. And why on earth were fictional cartoon characters included? Not happy at all."
8924,2724,5," Bought as a joke gift....he liked it."
8925,2724,5," Great selection of cards and high my teenage daughter received in her stocking! Great fun with these at XmasReasonably priced and well made"
8926,2724,5," Present for my brother in law.His only complaint is that he finds it hard to rank cats as he loves all the fluffy ones equally."
8927,2724,4," Good entertaining game for the family& although you do wonder on the rating of some of the categories"
8928,2725,5," These are easily the best card sleeves I've ever purchased the quality of them is magnificent they are really well made and the design is beautiful& The sleeves are easy to shuffle and play with they are just amazing all around."
8929,2726,5," Scholar is one of the handful of solo expansions for Sentinels Of The Multiverse. In the pack you get his character card& a biography card& his standard 40 card deck& and a divider for the box.I didn't really 'get' Scholar during my first few plays& but once you work out the best strategies (basically using him to withstand damage and draw fire away from other heroes) he's actually a useful addition to any hero line-up& if perhaps slightly overpowered in terms of sometimes being able to take ridiculous amounts of damage. He's probably not the most exciting of the heroes& and is less fun than the other solo hero expansion (Unity)& but given how cheap the deck is to purchase there's really no reason not to get it if you're a Sentinels fan as he adds more variety to your hero selection."
8930,2727,5," Mini version of the original top trumps in a cardboard packet. Am sure the boys will love them in their party bags! Must just say the customer service from Winning Moves was fantastic& they speeded up delivery at no extra cost so I got them in time for the party& would definitely use them again!"
8931,2727,5," These are a good little present for kids& and pass a few hours... Worth getting for a good price."
8932,2727,4," Good top trumps starter set  - great for car journeys for football fans"
8933,2727,5," Present for a little neighbour - a keen football fan. He will love it!"
8934,2727,5," Thank you for the cards& i will share them out between the children"
8935,2728,5," great way to try out pendulum monsters"
8936,2729,5," Great! My little boy was so pleased. Great service and well worth the money paid for this product! Thank you!"
8937,2730,5," Nice pack& picky son very pleased. So I am happy& thank you& quality service"
8938,2731,5," I love this game. Getting a replacement copy as the cards are showing so much wear. It's genuinely very good. Hence the 5 stars.Sadly as a lazy student I only learnt English. The shame..."
8939,2732,3," cards are of good quality and delivery was prompt. However& the picture depicts cards larger than actual size."
8940,2732,5," These came very quickly and they were a brilliant resource to use in the classroom!"
8941,2732,5," Great for school& the kids love these extra large cards"
8942,2732,5," Not as big as they look in the pics but still good"
8943,2732,5," Really good pack of large playing cards x"
8944,2732,4," Good product for the kids"
8945,2732,5," Excellent bigger size :)"
8946,2732,5," Excellent for senior people when we play a game called HOY and they can see the cards easily."
8947,2733,5," no problems"
8948,2734,5," 3 year old loves playing these games& fun for all the family."
8949,2735,5," I think these are going to be an excellent antidote to the packets upon packets of cheaper-priced cards that we always seem to have lying around our house in various stages of decline. This plastic version with the respected Piatnik name& appears to be strong and durable. You will never manage to dog-ear these through incompetent shuffling or playing |Spit|!Bought as a present for my husband& who plays Patience for about half an hour every day&  his only slight reservation after a week's use& is that the deck's slightly heavier than 'card' cards& so it's taking a little while to acquire a new shuffling technique.I too found them quite slippery to hold onto while shuffling& but then any new pack slides around at first. I assume these cards too& will get 'seasoned' with dirt and skin oils& if you'll excuse the image& just like any other pack that has to be worn in. Hopefully& the deck will then handle more easily& with less slip.It seems possible these cards could last so long that the print wears off& or maybe that the cards get so dirty you can't see the markings properly... Whether my other half ever feels the need to add them to the washing up bowl remains to be seen - then the seasoning process would presumably begin all over again. Whatever the case& they really do feel like they're here to stay for years& and they are nice-looking as well as practical. Although I wouldn't normally describe something plastic as particularly aesthetic & the cards are however lovely to own because they are so robust and good at their job.This is a good buy as far as we can tell& and for the quality and predicted longevity& most definitely a saving on the playing card budget for the next x number of years.Read more â€º"
8950,2735,5," If you're looking for long& lasting& durable card then you've found the right place. These cards are amazing for card tricks which require bending of the cards slightly& and they don't even mark. You'll find the ink will rub off before you manage to ruin these card through overuse. I highly recommend these for people looking to do tricks or just alot of card games!"
8951,2735,5," Ever since I was a young lad I've always played cards. The quality of the cards as I remember was never good. They always used to easily rip or bend. I can't say the same of these cards though. If you are considering buying these then I would highly recommend them. I'm not sure I can justify the high price tag& but you pay for quality."
8952,2735,5," I have bought several other bridge cards cause my dad was a national player and still goes to the club for a play every evening for a few hours without fail. He says all the ones that I ever bought for him these are the best ones so far and now its 6 sets bought from the same seller. Fantastic. They last nearly 3 month of every evening playing and still its not in too bad shape except that they fade from lot of rubbing in shuffling and serious players dont like it. I still use dads used cards to play friendly card games with friends and they are still superior by a mile to the regular stuff u buy off the shelf. There is just no comparison. I highly recommend them for serious players. not for the regular players like me who anyways wont spend 20 quids for a couple of decks."
8953,2735,5," The cards are high quality and almost indestructible.They come as two packs in one plastic case.I liked them so much I ordered a second set (of two packs)Unfortunately on the second order the plastic case was cracked on arrival due to poor wrapping.For me this was not a problem but could be for others.Piatnik plastic playing cards - double deck"
8954,2736,4," Was looking for Clear Wing Synchro Dragon& but didn't find it. Still I found some valuable cards worth keeping. Would recommend for this price."
8955,2736,5," Not sure what i can say really& has 24 packs like listed and was delivered fast/"
8956,2736,5," Good set& worth purchasing"
8957,2737,5," Excellent value for money this comic maker- my 6yr old daughter loves it. There are lots to do in this pack to make the magazine of your choosing with a Minnie theme."
8958,2737,5," My daughter (7) has had hrs of fun with this. Lots of stickers& stamps& writing boxes. Lots of fun in making your own magazine."
8959,2738,4," Sheriff of Nottingham is a lot of fun& but does require a particular type of person to play. The game is predominately about bluffing& or at least bluffing at the right time to get through as many goods passed your friends as possible.The detail in the game is great& the coins& market stands and sheriff token are thick card and the artwork is outstanding. This game has high production values& even the box has this unique feel and grain.Generally its an awesome game& recommend 4+ players for the best experience."
8960,2738,5," Really good fun! Watching friends squirm when you call their bluff& getting people to pay other people to check bags or seeing couples and close friends try and tell if the other is lying. Been played many times& the contents look great and are made from thick card. It even had drink spilled on it one night and the card didn't split or warp. If you like playing games with friends or family or want a good game to start with I would suggest this& even my nephews like it and they are 8 and 10."
8961,2738,4," This game is really good fun with enough people& but probably wouldn't recommend for smaller groups. It's very quick and easy to pick up and can lead to a lot of hilarity if you play with a group willing to roleplay a bit. I'd suggest with 4 people to play for at least one extra round& as it was a little too quick for my taste. Otherwise& a solid and fun game!"
8962,2738,5," Great game& it took a while to arrive but despite that...great stuff. So much fun& the quality of the pieces&e verything. I love this game."
8963,2738,5," Great game. Pouches can be a little fragile around the 'poppers' but the components all round are great."
8964,2738,3," Good and super fun game& but the low quality pouches. The buttons work& but the cloth started ripping around the buttons about three games in."
8965,2738,5," Fantastic game my grandsons loved it. I really enjoyed it too!"
8966,2738,3," This isn't a bad game& but to me it has a lot of chrome for what it is.  For bluffing games I would choose Liars Dice (Bluff) over this: shorter but deeper.I need to add that the production values of this game are very high.  Beautiful bits!"
8967,2739,5," Preview card placed proudly within my collection."
8968,2740,5," These sleeves are just amazing! When I ordered them i expected a lot less& but what I got was just amazing. The art is great& same goes for the quality. I would say these sleeves are at about the same quality as Dragon Shields so they are just perfect for your MTG cards. I'm sure they're great for other card games too. Best sleeves for a Game of Thrones and MTG fan!"
8969,2740,5," Lovely art work arrived on time partner loved them."
8970,2741,5," Smash Hits top trumps is a really good game which you can play anywhere. With interesting facts about lots of popstars. The game is played by one person reading out a statistic on a card and another person has to beat that statistic by producing a higher number. It's a very interesting game and you won't be able to let go of your cards. It's a great little present to put in a stocking and I definitely recommend them for all ages."
8971,2742,5," With Burger Boss& Legend Express have really found their feet. Yes& the packaging is fantastic (the game comes inside a burger)& but great packaging doesn't make for a great game experience. Thankfully the meat inside this burger is some prime patty!Your task is simple& customers are queuing up for food and your burger joint needs to fill their bellies. You have workers that can be assigned to various parts of the business to achieve that goal& but the key is in assigning them to the right jobs at the right time. All of which would be simple if the resources weren't finite. Keep an eye on your opponents because they'll be trying to restrict what your workers can do and you'll need to do the same to them as you try to gain the advantage and get first pick of the customers bellies to fill.There are other flourishes that add special sauce to the recipe and there is a child-like joy of producing physical representations of the burgers you're making with the small colour coded components in the box. It's a great package& with far greater tactical depth than Legend Express' first game. For families it should play well for 8+& but can be easily simplified for a younger audience."
8972,2742,5," Loved this game so much I had to write a review. If you have a few friends round and fancy a game that's a little different and a tone of fun give it a go. Really easy to pick up and play"
8973,2742,5," Nice clean design& fun& captivating. Fantastic. Can't remember a game where we played for 2 hrs straight. If you get this you will not be disappointed. Happily give 5 stars."
8974,2742,5," We played this with a few friends after dinner last weekend and I have to say that this is such a simple yet addictive game! We managed to convince one of our non-gamer friends into playing this thanks to its attractive packaging and simple instructions! In fact& he couldn't stop talking about it and is very impressed at how far board games have evolved since his old Monopoly days! Well done& Burger Boss!"
8975,2742,5," I  am addicted ! This game is amazing !!!"
8976,2742,5," Burger Boss is a fun game with fantastic packaging and artwork!  This really is a gem of a game with good design and a surprising amount of strategy.  It is streamlined and well balanced& and doesn't have too many rules that might put off the casual gamer.  After playing it for the first time& we immediately wanted to play again once we realised the different strategies involved.  Highly recommended!"
8977,2742,5," A great new game with interesting mechanics. Different from anything else out there. Love the burger box that the game comes in as well. Just think the artwork could have been brighter and simpler with a less creepy looking guy on the box! But game play itself is easily 5 *. Highly recommend."
8978,2742,3," Not the easiest to follow& takes alot of setting up& my brood ages 10 to 18& don't rate it as they got bored before even starting to play properly."
8979,2743,5," this is great for kids - nice large size cards& and lovely pictures.will definately buy some others for xmas presents"
8980,2743,5," lovely item brought as a gift great little tin to keep the cards safe stop the kids losing em bending em...:)"
8981,2743,5," My little boy loved these cards and loved the different games you can play with them and thinks the tin is great too !"
8982,2743,3," Bought as a birthday present for a young man who loves pirates.  Disappointed on how small the tin is& still I am happy I bought the card game as I hope the young man likes playing with the cards.  I haven't obviously opened it as it is a present so not sure if the cards have pictures of pirates on."
8983,2743,3," Nothing to shout home about& it does the job& but did not hold my 5 yrs old grandson attention after game one."
8984,2743,4," bought this game for my grandson who is pirate mad  ve ry well made lovely tin a nice gift  really pleased"
8985,2744,5," Nice stocking filler for people of a certain age."
8986,2744,5," my son loves top trumps.thank you"
8987,2744,4," Bought for Christmas present so can't comment on what they are like& but the packaging is intact and undamaged."
8988,2745,4," Good fun when playing between 3 or 4 players"
8989,2745,5," Just what I wanted"
8990,2746,5," no problems"
8991,2747,4," Got this to play with the family over Christmas as we all like a quiz.  This was a great spin on Trivial Pursuit as doesn't take potentially hours to play.  We played without using the buzz card as we didn't really like the 'quick' idea of stealing someone's question but having to buzz the card& was almost like snap.  Good idea for a quick thinking game.  Only issue is the same as what other people have commented& you only get a small number of question cards.  The questions are a good mix& nothing too easy but nothing too difficult to make it impossible.  Only problem we had is we got through the pack so quickly we ended up getting some same questions twice& but that's one way to learn."
8992,2747,5," Great game. And is very portable."
8993,2748,3," So far I'm not sure that I really like this version of the game. When I became a fan of the game I really did enjoy playing the themed versions of Fluxx and I thought I'd try out what the main game was all about.The game is good& and makes you think"
8994,2748,4," Crazy game& but we love it. For the money could do with a decent box to keep the cards in."
8995,2748,5," This has to be the best card game I've ever played. I was first itroduced to it at the age of 16 by my geeky friends and it always caused much confusion and laughter. Once we'd get the rules sorted out it was so fun to play. Six years on I've gone and bought my own copy and I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone asking!"
8996,2748,5," This game is amazing. Had previously played star fluxx but brought fluxx 5.0 to bring to a house party. We played for nearly 2 hours having loads of fun. Starts simple but can end up chaotic as at one point we had 12 different rules in play(thank god for rules reset and simplify action cards)"
8997,2748,5," You'll never forget where you were when you play your first game of Fluxx."
8998,2748,5," Great game& loved the helter skelter nature of this."
8999,2749,5," EXCELLENT PRODUCTS"
9000,2750,3," I have an original John Jacques set of this game and this was a little disappointing. The set consists of forty cards but my original has sixty four cards. The colour printing is not as sharp as it could be but the set is nevertheless not bad value for money."
9001,2750,5," wanted this as it reminded me of my childhool and I can play it with anyone.Very pleased.  Would recommend."
9002,2750,5," Would definitely not hesitate to buy from this seller again. A+++++++++++"
9003,2750,5," great"
9004,2751,5," The Alchemy England 1977 by Bicycle is a really wonderful deck.The 1977 refers to the date  Designers- Alchemy  established themselves to the world. The theme is a mash up Gothic& Steam Punk& Bikers& Skulls& Magic& Tattoo& Betty Page Pinups from the 40s and... well if you get to see the deck you will understand what I mean.Each of the 52 cards - 56 if you count all of them has a different art picture.There are 2 Jokers& One spare Joker and a Trade card which has the same back as the rest but the front a side view of the skull- wonderful.This differs from other decks where it is only the Court cards and the Jokers that have  the art.There are no additional 'Gaff' cards alas which is a shame but perhaps& because the deck is so wonderful we may be too greedy expecting one? The backs and box feature a Skull but if you look hard enough you will see the Trompe D'Oriel of a girl a 'Gestalt switch' I believe.My favourites when forced to chose has to be the two Jokers& one featuring Bare 'Knuckle Betty' the other  a steam punk girl atop a motorised Penny farthing.As to the suites for me Clubs wins hands down. The King features a Victoria gentleman walking down a London Street up to no good.Each of the four suits& hearts& diamonds& clubs and spades have been reinterpreted the clubs looking almost unrecognisable being more circular - more like the coins symbol from The Tarot& French and Italian decks.The cards are poker size& indeed it is a poker deck .The deck& being Bicycles' usual high standard has an  air flow finish  so the cards are brilliant to handle.Read more â€º"
9005,2751,5," Well designed plasticard deck of cards& with a design behind the numbers of the card so each is still easy to see. Only difference is the clubs are more of a circular star than the normal club& but once you know it is of no worry."
9006,2751,5," Wonderful art work on each card. Loved the 'slide' of each card and that unlike other decks I've owned these do not stick together. Overall a very good quality deck for a very reasonable price from the seller.The playing cards arrived within the given delivery time and were parcelled very well& arriving in excellent condition.I definitely recommend these playing cards and seller& they definitely deserve the 5 star rating. :-)"
9007,2751,5," I bought these for my son as a present and he loves them. hes into card magic and has been wanting a good quality deck to perform tricks with so I bought these. he says they are lovely and smooth to shuffle and handle& the images are great and the card quality is strong but not inflexible to handling."
9008,2751,4," this is a wicked design. i love the artwork. going for only four stars a the air cushioning makes it really dificult to manipulate the cards without them falling all over the place. which i would prefer they didn't as i am a little tense about ruining new things. but all rond a nice feeling deck."
9009,2751,5," excellent& bought one set then 2 more for friends. Love the designs& every card has a different background with the royals being full edge to edge pictures& even has one or 2 artworked cards because i assume 54 cards (inc jokers) wasnt enough. Recommend for tatoo ideas aswell :D"
9010,2751,5," The design of these cards is amazing! Every single card is different and the artwork is gorgeous. The cards feel really nice in the hand& very slippery and a good thickness. They are so nice I don't want to play with them! Definitely worth getting if you collect cards!"
9011,2751,5," I cannot recommend these cards highly enough. Each suit comes with a beautifully designed theme& with the highest value cards carrying amazingly detailed images& and it is all finished with an almost papyrus feel. If you want a new deck& this is the way to go."
9012,2752,4," Arrived quickly and product same as toys t us but cheaper"
9013,2752,5," Very satisfactory& many thanks."
9014,2753,5," Bought these as a gift for my boyfriend and I am surprised at how good a quality they are considering the cost under a tenner. Fantastic product!"
9015,2753,5," Excellent quality print"
9016,2753,5," Excellent"
9017,2754,5," I bought a set of these for our 6 year old for his seventh birthday& and you know the story& the more expensive presents hardly got played with& but these cards I am not surprised that they are not dog eared (pardon the pun).The cards are quite well made& not flimsy cheap card the printing and pictures excellent. Plus they are quite educational& which also helps& as afterall if the child is having fun playing& they sometimes don't realise just how much knowledge they have gained& but ask a simple question about one of the Dogs a few days later and you will be amazed at just what they have picked up.They have been played with non-stop& I didn't play these with our daughter the first time they came out& and I have now seen what I have missed out on.  Even I have tried to play the game& you should try them!All we heard in the car on a very long journey were questions about the dogs& these were being asked backwards and forwards& I think I know more about the weights and different breeds of dogs than ever.  At least it stops the question of 'are we there yet?'  I would glady buy another set of these cards (have noticed that there are different categories) as they really do stop the boredom from setting in& plus you don't need a table or surface& (could cut that time of boredom at the airport departure lounge& or anywhere else there is likely to be a delay).Great cheap stocking fillers and something that all ages can play& can get the more girlie type categories for girls& or the boyish ones& so basically something for everyone including adults. Useful to have in over the Christmas/summer holidays when people get together maybe of different ages& as age six to teenagers can play happily whilst the adults can talk or whatever.Read more â€º"
9018,2754,1," Each breed is represented by a photo of the puppy taken with a fish eye lens.  You can barely recognise most of the breeds.  Doesn't teach a thing.  And how can you miss out Intelligence as a competing attribute.  We own about 15 sets of Top Trumps& and these are the worst.  Hoping that someone produces a proper set of Dog Top Trumps soon..."
9019,2754,4," Perfect for keeping my daughter entertained on the ferry crossing to Calais& its a family friendly game which kids enjoy. My youngest has started a collection!"
9020,2754,5," Bought as a stocking filler for Christmas for my 5 year old girl. It has been a huge hit and one of her favourite presents. The game is really simple to understand and she soon has learnt the best strategies to play so that she can now beat Mummy!  She loves the cute pictures of the dogs and her knowledge of the different breeds is now quite impressive.  Easy to play& easy to carry around when travelling. We will be buying more sets of Top Trumps."
9021,2754,3," Bought these for my granddaughter who is mad about dogs!We felt disappointed that the dog pictures on the cards were more cartoon than lovable!!We did enjoy playing the game but my granddaughter tired of it quite quickly.This was because she didn't fall in love with the animals on the card like she did with Top Trumps Horses!Educational in that it teaches children the strength's and weaknesses of different breed's of dog."
9022,2754,4," Bought as a girlie night in bingo prize& which has to be reasonably priced"
9023,2754,4," The game lasted a couple of minutes the first one and then the second one lasted half an hour so it depends on luck. All of the dogs were puppies but didn't have some really famous dogs. I don't think it had a collie but might of. Some of the pictures the dogs were too close to camera but overall a good game of top trumps."
9024,2754,5," I bought these top trumps cards for my daughter who is obsessed with dogs"
9025,2755,4," For the price and the fact it is Frozen& this wa a nice little stocking filler for my daughter xx"
9026,2755,5," Reasonably priced cards& nice pictures& little girl pleased"
9027,2755,5," better quality than others out there good value"
9028,2755,3," smaller than i thought but little one is happy"
9029,2756,5," this is such a cute game& my daughter loved it and found it quite hilarious"
9030,2756,5," got these for a table ctvity for my niece for my wedding& think she will love them go with my vintage theme wedding."
9031,2757,5," Miss Information is a villain expansion for Sentinels Of The Multiverse"
9032,2757,5," Great Expansion& Because you cant attack untill miss information flips it allows some of the more support and setup heros to be played& adds some variety to the base set."
9033,2757,5," An interesting mini-expansion. Worth trying out."
9034,2758,5," As far as I'm aware these are a must for anyone who plays Dominion. The game requires the deck to be shuffled almost continuously so while having the sleeves can make shuffling more difficult (until you get the hang of it) it will stop your precious cards from getting scuffed and torn.They're easy to put the cards into (there's an opening on a short end like a document wallet)& and I've only had a couple tear from careless shuffles.Having bought Dominion expansions& I just accept sleeves as part of the cost of buying the game. If only they were sold in packs of 500!"
9035,2758,5," These are just the thing to look after your cards. I use mine to cover my Dominion cards. It take a little getting used to they also are a little reflective in natural light.However& that said.They are nice and thin and do not bulk out your cards& so for the most part you can fit your cards back into their original box. This is a good product that does exactly what it is supposed to do."
9036,2758,4," I bought these sleeves for the Agricola game& as it has tons of cards& but they are not used |a lot| (They are drawn once at the beginning of the game& not pick one per turn or similar) so these sleeves work perfectly fine.However& if you want the sleeves for other more intensive use games (ie: Dominion)& you should probably get the Premium version."
9037,2758,5," Excellent product and service. Strong and clear they provide ideal protection There are so many options on size that I will be going back for more."
9038,2759,5," Came in perfect condition& it even said on the packing |Do not Bend| which is phenomenal!Came early too& recommended 100% and it's a great addition to my deck"
9039,2760,5," Very good quality set in a durable box - perfect for taking with you on trips. There are two sets of cards with the same colour backs& and they  are individually wrapped. Card values are printed on the fronts of the cards to help you adding up the scores& which is useful. Rules are provided& as are a few score sheets too& to get you started. Would definitely recommend."
9040,2760,5," We purchased these cards with the intention of teaching our friends to play Canasta. We learned the game with my parents from one card book and some internet sites& but found that they were never quite clear on the rules and at times we struggled to figure out exactly what the rules should be in certain situations and couldn't find a set of rules that we could decipher in every particular. Well& imagine my joy at finding that the rules accompanying this canasta set are clear& concise and non-contradictory!"
9041,2760,5," I would truly recommend this game to anyone - it is a great laugh& and strategic enough to get you thinking a bit! We regularly play with family and friends and love it!Not difficult learn& I learnt it myself in only a game or two!"
9042,2760,5," Canasta is a suberb traditional card game (a way to do something with the older Kids!) which is easily learnt (the boxed set comes with the game rules).  It will give hours of pleasure to two or more people - play alone or in teams."
9043,2760,5," Although this is considered an adult card game& we play this with our nieces and nephews aged 10 to 16 as well as adults in the family.  The youngest (10)is normally advised (helped) by his grandfther.  They all absolutely love the game and happily focus and concentrate on the game for hours.GREAT FUN"
9044,2760,5," Thank you for prompt delivery and this is an excellent replacement for our previous very worn out set after use for many years.  Thoroughly enjoyable game which tests your concentration skills."
9045,2760,4," This is good value for money as you get two packs of cards& with the 'canasta' values printed on them. You need this when totally up scores at the end each hand.  Plus a brief instruction book on how to play the game.  As with all instructions for card games it is easier if you play with someone who knows the game - but the instructions are not too complicated and they give variations on the basic game. There are also 4 scoring sheets - a bit flimsy - but again adequate.So for a complete beginner who wants to play canasta& be it a child from 8 years to grannies and grandpa's this pack will suit all ages. You can play the game with 2& 3& or 4 people - singles or doubles.My friends and I have all bought the game so that we have the cards when we go round to each others houses to play.I haven't rated this higher as it is not strictly a toy - but if you enjoy playing card games this is great as it is interesting& easy to get to grips with and nowhere nearly as difficult as bridge."
9046,2760,5," Having bought Canasta we havent stopped playing its very challenging and very good for teaching adding up.excellent item would recommend to friends"
9047,2761,5," Good gift for west ham fan"
9048,2762,5," Great compact game. The cards are fairly small& probably because they have to be arranged sequentially on a table (get your glasses at the ready). It was surprisingly difficult - even my husband who is annoyingly good at history got some wrong when the dates were close together. Because of this and because there are some things that can be used as clues it helps to even up the chances for the kids. My 9 year old daughter beat me twice& not because she knows more history but& because she has a smart kid's  brain that remembers things from previous games and puts clues together better than me. Maybe& after multiple games& the cards will be memorised (we'll see and it probably won't be by me). Each game lasted about 20 minutes to half an hour for three of us. Quick start - no rules to wade through. Think it will be educational because it prompted discussion and awareness of discoveries even if exact dates aren't memorised. looks like other cards in the series could be added to expand the game."
9049,2762,4," The timeline series is a fun little game for the end of the night& or even as a small after dinner game. Everyone gets a card with a picture and an event named on it. They take it in turns to place that event into the timeline (made up of previous correctly laid events)& if you get it wrong draw a new event. The winner is the first to place all of their cards.The discoveries set can cause a few arguments if you have some 'armchair historians' as a few events have debatable dates."
9050,2762,5," Great little game& and can be highly amusing when combined with the other variants."
9051,2763,5," This game is a great one and also being frozen brings it up to date very popular with my grandchildren"
9052,2764,4," A few friends and I had a craft morning& and decided to start with silk painting. We all enjoyed it& and found  patterns that we liked."
9053,2764,5," good kit& Has everything you need as a starter kit"
9054,2765,5," Crackin cards in there case &&bought as a gift and the kid loved the wee pictures good and clear"
9055,2765,5," This is one of the best top trump sets I have got for my kids.  Nice pictures and animal facts and also great humour with the inclusion of Pingu& Penguins of Madagascar.  Made a great novelty gift for my 9 year olds birthday"
9056,2765,5," Excellent top trumps set with lots of information about the Penguins. Just right for our grandson who is into penguins!"
9057,2765,5," I have a penguin mad grandson who absolutely loved these cards. Very pleased."
9058,2765,5," This was a Christmas present for my son and he loves it.  Not only has it got real penguins in it& it also includes Mubble (happy feet)& the penguins of Madagascar and 'The' penguin (batman)& amongst others.  Lovely game especially for those who love penguins and animals."
9059,2765,5," I bought this as a Christmas present for my penguin-mad 10yo daughter. She loved it. She and her brother have played a few games since Christmas and have enjoyed the game& the facts and the pictures. Good fun."
9060,2765,5," Everything you want in a top trump& funny facts& penguins. I mean seriously. How can you not like penguins."
9061,2766,5," Excellent top trumps& ideal for phineas and ferb fans& very pleased with them.  Helps you learn more about the individual characters have you have information on each card."
9062,2766,4," Bought for a friend's son as a little extra to go with his main present.  He loves Phinea and Ferb so this was as bit hit."
9063,2766,5," Kids love them& great value and a classic all time great game& well made& cards not all flimsy& very good :)"
9064,2766,5," Granddaughter already had a set so it's a spare"
9065,2766,5," Fast delivery and fab product"
9066,2767,5," In the box you receive 52 tiles& 4 tile holders and a set of rules.  What I really like about this game is there are two ways to play depending on the age of children playing.With my 3 year old daughter joining in we played the simple version which is essentially a matching game.  Players take it in turns to turn over two tiles and match either character or colour.  My daughter was able to join in with us playing the game this way.The slightly more complicated way is for older children though younger children can join in with an adult.  This version of the game is classic rummy with a Disney twist.  Be the first player to get rid of all of your tiles by making a run of numbers with the same colour or a set of the same number but different colours.The game is aimed at ages 4+& however& as I said above& my 3 year old was able to play the easy game.  It is definitely a game that can grow with your child and& because the tiles are such excellent quality it should last some time.The game is aimed at 2 to 4 players and takes around 15 minutes to play.  I can see us playing this game together a lot& it is a perfect game for the whole family.I received this game in return for my honest blog review."
9067,2768,5," A must for all Border Collie lovers"
9068,2769,5," no problems"
9069,2770,5," A brief evaluationProsColourful theme that actually make sense to the game mechanicQuality components&  the wooden sweets are greatSimple rulesSufficient depth of strategySmall boxShortish game play 45 minutesConsSome might consider artwork childishTwo only playersAnalysis paralasis could enlongate game beyond 60 minutesConclusion: a little classicNb& some easy addition required to play"
9070,2770,5," Great 2 player game"
9071,2771,4," I really rate Dominion highly and have many of the expansions. My problem from the beginning with the base sets was the design/colour of the treasure cards. Why would Copper& Silver and Gold all be the same colour?! How did it get through playtesting without someone saying& why is the Silver... not Silver?!Anyway this base card set rectifies that with new treasure& victory& curse& potion and trash cards. Each card has lovely artwork.It is a shame that these cards were not as standard in the base set as for Â£15 there is nothing new here& just aesthetics. For most people they probably wont mind playing the standard cards but the base set does make it easier differentiating your money and I think it looks a lot nicer.Anyway I give it 4 stars because they are a good addition to Dominion& its just a shame you have to pay Â£15 for cards I feel should have been in the sets as standard.Just one thing to consider is that the new Victory Cards have the victory points in the bottom right corner of each card. For new players the older Victory cards are probably easier to learn with as it will take a bit of time to get used to the picture difference between Estates& Duchies& Provinces and Colonies. Other than that I would recommend using the new treasure cards straight away."
9072,2771,4," This set of treasure and victory cards is great for allowing you to play expansion sets for Dominion on their own. THe new graphics look great& but are the source of the one drawback - the values on the cards are not as obvious as on the original cards & which had the treasure and victory point values in large figures in the middle of the card. The new ones just have a small figure in the bottom right hand corner. This is not really an issue for experienced players& who are used to the values& but for newer players it takes a bit of getting used to."
9073,2771,5," The artwork on these alone makes them worth a purchase for all Dominion fans!!Over time and use the money and location cards cards start to look a little worse for ware so this set is a brilliant and inexpensive addition.Take a look at the artwork on the box as the cards are now all illustrated& which makes game play so much more fun and they're easier to distinguish."
9074,2771,5," Some of the cards in the box were duplicated and some omitted.  Amazon responded very positively in providing replacements.  Quality of cards is excellent to add to enjoyment of Dominion series of games."
9075,2772,1," Opened packet to find top trumps Olympic gold medallists not one direction. Think something went slightly wrong there. As it was a Xmas present there was no time for a return."
9076,2772,5,""
9077,2772,5," Lovely present for any girl who loves one direction. Will be thinking about this for other family members when required."
9078,2772,5," great"
9079,2773,5," We bought this rummy mainly for entertainment away from home. Very handy& the stands fit into each other to make a convenient& oval holder for the pieces. Must have if convenience is your thing."
9080,2773,5," We recently went on a cruise and saw some American people playing this in fact we joined in at their invitation and really enjoyed the game.  It is just like the card game of Rummy except it is played with little tiles similar to the ones used in Scrabble.There are larger versions as well as the travel one so we will be buying one of these also.  It is a great game for the whole family& my 7 year old grandson just loves it."
9081,2773,5," Good quality at good price. The stands clip together to also form the container. Well thought out."
9082,2773,5," Superb product  and for compactness surpasses the Classic original.  Although not stated in the information the 4 player tile holders fit together  to form a very compact and robust oval container for all the tiles and instructions etc.  So no need to take the box with you on your travels."
9083,2773,5," Excellent product and a game one can easily become addicted to.  It is conveniently designed with the tiles contained within the racks when they are fitted together and takes up very little space when travelling.  The racks themselves are sturdy and fit together very strongly.  Couldn't fault anything - a very good buy and a fascinating game"
9084,2773,5," We have been playing this game for many years& although we can't find our original game! Bought this for both at home and in the caravan. Took it to my parents& (93 and 90) and they are now hooked and I had to get a set for them too. Our sons have been playing this from an early age and now the grandsons are playing it as well (5 and 7) A very good game that gets your mind really going as you try to work out a forward plan to put your tiles down& only to be thwarted by another player before its your turn. Our fortnightly visit to the parents is always rounded off with a game. If we don't play they are disappointed.A brilliant game for all of the family."
9085,2773,5," Everything good everyone else has said& plus I would say this is better than 'full size' sets I've used. The tiles are big enough& the stands are brilliant as the tiles go into slots rather than perching on ledges& so they don't all fall off when you want to slide them along to make a space for another. Perfect!"
9086,2773,5," Great quality tiles& very compact travel package made of the support stands.Probably you should add a photo of that stands package to show how well it actually suits for travelling :)"
9087,2774,3," BEWARE: This set comes only with 2 Assassin token cards& unlike what is stated in the product's description (both Amazon and the deck box say it includes 3 cards). This seems to be an issue with the european version of this product. Not cool Wizards!!Also note that included deckboxes are for unsleeved cards.Otherwise seems to include a good selection of cards esp. for beginners and I look forward to playing it."
9088,2774,5," These decks have proven great to get new people involved in MTG.  They seem well balanced against each other& and work well in 3 player FFA etc vs other similar duel decks like Phyrexia vs the Coalition for example."
9089,2774,3," If found this pack a bit mixed in that it comes with loads of info on how to play& much more than you get with the 'Origins Clash Pack' making it better for new players& but the Plainswalkers cards (Jace"
9090,2774,5," Great introduction to Magic the Gathering for people who have never played.  Ideal holiday game for off weather days& can be played on a relatively small table."
9091,2774,5," As everyone says& dual decks are perfect for introducing new people to MTG& but they're also great for having a casual game with anyone& no matter what their level of interest or skill! Dual decks are created to compliment each other well and to balance out each other's strengths and weaknesses. No messing& no agonizing over your sideboard. Just play!"
9092,2774,5," Lovely duel deck great for first time players or someone looking for a bit of themed fun. Deck boxes provided are nicely illustrated and make it easy to take magic out and about. The Mrs and I love to play any chance we get and we've had great fun with this duel deck."
9093,2775,5," Resin house cards for fantasy flights A game of thrones LCG. Solid built good design show your colours. Ideal for joust and tournament play."
9094,2776,5," Got it on the recommendation if the Mrs. Was massively skeptical as it looked a little bit shallow.Glad to be proven wrong. :) great fun& quick to pick up& actually quite a lot of room for tactics. It now comes everywhere with us. :)"
9095,2777,5," A great expansion!Great value with 6 new heroes (including 2 of my comic favourites - Swamp Thing"
9096,2777,4," A good add on to the original set however it does make the game significantly more challenging. I like that& so it gets the four stars from me....my daughter loves the base set but isn't too keen on the Crisis and Impossible Mode cards featured in this set& so maybe check out some gameplay footage on youtube before purchasing.What you do get in this set is the new Crisis card set. This includes 15 cards based on events from comics history that present real issues to overcome for the players who are now working as a team to overthrow the latest influx of supervillains who each bring with them a Crisis. Villains are now actually villains and instead of purchasing them with your power scores& you are now defeating them.I won't spoil the events outlined in the crisis deck or the changes and surprise additions to the impossible mode super villains - let's just say they are very difficult to beat and can be a little frustrating at times (hence the loss of a star)Personally& I recommend this addition to the base set and think it brings a much needed variant of play which keeps the game feeling fresh and challenging and more than a little exciting."
9097,2777,5," This adds an exciting dimension to an already great card game.  I don't like games where lots of stuff has to be laid out and set up - taking an hour before you can even play the game. This fits the bill& and is exactly what we wanted.  You get some new super hero cards& new super villains to defeat and a new way to play the game.  Well worth the expense!"
9098,2777,5," Taking my favorite deck builder and making it work as a co-op& how could I not buy this expansion.Have had great fun with this game and found it suitably challenging as a co-op to want to go back and try it over and over again."
9099,2778,5," look great"
9100,2779,5," Such a fun game! A definite must-have for the upcoming winter nights in! Suitable for the family or for an evening with friends (and a bottle of wine). Watch out though- things quickly get competitive! Looking forward to playing again."
9101,2779,5," Played this game with a group of friends one evening and we had such a laugh.Its a knowledge based game with a great range of subjects all of varying difficultly.It has a perfect level of depth for a quick quiz game that has excellent replay value.Games last about 10-15 minutes and it's very hard to say no to another round!(Can be very easily converted into a drinking game)"
9102,2779,5," I ordered Mr Listerâ€™s Quiz Shootout (MLQS from now on) along with the rather fantastic Qwordie a couple of weeks ago and have been delighted with it. Iâ€™ve played it with groups from 5-25 people.As explained in my review of Qwordie& I run a boardgames club at a boys secondary school (ages 11-16). The responses have been overwhelmingly positive.In MLQS you have as many teams as you like and you fire off questions such as: What are the ingredients in a Big Mac?Teams list everything they can think of and then take turns to give an answer at a time. Wrong answers or blanks get you eliminated. Certain answers are golden as they are more obscure eg McDâ€™s special sauce.Once all the answers are given& any remaining teams or golden answer givers go through to the Shootout Round: Generally a guesstimate question eg How many Big Macs did McDâ€™s sell in 2014? Closest answer wins!You win a card which has a bottle on the back and the goal is to win 3 different bottles to win the whole game.Itâ€™s simple& it takes seconds to explain and players can drop in and out of teams at will: we even ended up with 2 big teams and used the Shootout question as a double or nothing round for cards and points.Iâ€™ve even started using it at the start or end of lessons to focus students. Quite simply: they love it!"
9103,2779,5," Great for playing with friends or family - lots of fun."
9104,2779,5," Such a simple but fantastic game! Having never heard of Mr Lister& I thought it was worth a punt for Â£15...I wasn't disappointed! The game can easily be played as individuals or teams (we played as 6 teams of pairs with one quiz master). The questions are all current (some referencing 2015) and are all suited to the UK (no random American questions). The majority of the question cards really got the competitiveness going and were all pitched at just the right level (not University challenge). The idea of the golden answers also built the suspense when going around the group& and encourages people to give more alternative answers rather than just going for the easy ones. All in all a great party game that can last for as long as you want it to (just decide how many cards the winner needs to collect). Highly recommended"
9105,2779,5," This is a great game to play with friends for the evening. You'll be amazed how successful a complete guess can be. We did not insist on the moustache however as it's surprisingly heavy."
9106,2779,5," Very good fun. A game best played with teams in pairs and a great one for families and friends alike. We also love 5 second rule and dobble as good board/card games."
9107,2779,5," What a great game! I was in John Lewis with a friend shopping for a Christmas present for someone. We were looking for a good board game and everything was looking a bit mundane until we noticed the guy promoting Mr Lister and a few other Big Potato games. We were instantly hooked& getting extremely competitive in the few minutes spent playing the game in-store! We even boasted about it to another friend later that day who then bought it and got addicted himself. A great game for friends and family& and a perfect Christmas present!"
9108,2780,5," Product was great& well packaged and sturdy& nice to look at and great for storing oversized cards and bottom compartment can store an additional single sleeved deck of 100 cards or easily a 60 card sleeved deck with sideboard and divider"
9109,2780,5," Fantastic box& all my local players want one now. Bargain :)"
9110,2780,5," A little bigger than expected& but extremely noice"
9111,2781,5," Our kids played with this every day for 2 weeks& we pull it out often still and always have fun playing it.  Thanks Disney."
9112,2782,5," Bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas as he's a massive Star Wars fan& and he loved them& really different to packs he has seen before!"
9113,2782,5," Absolutely love these cards. Got them for my boyfreind but I wish I hadn't handed them over! Might actually buy another set!"
9114,2782,5," make kids an advent calendar every year &put these in sons he loves them"
9115,2782,5," Good gift for star wars fan"
9116,2783,5," The cards are good quality& a nice size for children to handle& bright and colourful& just nice for a good family game."
9117,2783,4," Games arrived well within the stated time. Group of 10 and 11year olds really enjoyed playing this traditional game& although the 'perfect family of mum&dad& son and daughter' led to much discussion!"
9118,2783,5," What can I say about a pack of children's playing cards other than they met expectations in quality and are giving a lot of fun."
9119,2783,5," As described good delivery"
9120,2783,5," Bought for my grown up son as we used to play when he was younger"
9121,2783,5," I bought these for my grandaughter she loves them"
9122,2783,5," My Grandson loves this Happy Families card game."
9123,2783,5," Good games! I use it with my ESL students."
9124,2784,5," A really unique product - great for lovers of fma and fma:b (the theme is fma but most characters are ones featured in both fma and fma:b anime/manga series)"
9125,2784,5," This product is just as described"
9126,2785,5," :)"
9127,2786,5," We play 'the golden snitch' with these cards and my son loves them. Great novelty gift at a reasonable price."
9128,2787,5," I got this for my daughter (who adores love letter) and she much prefers this.It is very much based on love letter but that is no bad thing& as a 2 player game I think it is a better game."
9129,2787,4," To be honest& I love trumped-up versions of rock paper scissors& and I enjoy thinking one step ahead of my opponent. This game is also fun for kids& and I used it to get my little sister off an obsession with playing love letter!"
9130,2788,5," Lie Marilyn Monroe pics so these cards are ideal. Good quality"
9131,2789,5," Bought as a gift for a star wars fan& very nice with shots/scenes from the movies& really conveys that original trilogy feeling."
9132,2789,5," thank u for sending the playing cards & my family loves them"
9133,2790,5," My brother and I love playing cards together& we are both fans of Star Wars& and obviously familiar with Angry Birds& so this was quite an obvious purchase for me.The cards look very nice& and have a nice hard case which makes it easier to make sure they don't get lost or damaged."
9134,2791,4," not all of the cards have patterns. sad"
9135,2792,5," This game takes 15 - 30 minutes so you can play it quite often. I bought it for my brother because I wasn't sure if he would like the proper game. He really likes it& so its fun but now I wish I'd gotten a big version with more activities. Nevertheless& this game is very fun and good for anyone from around 7 years. The questions never get old and makes you think& unlike a lot of games for children. The cards are nice& large and glossy& giving the game a nice feel. I think it's better with more people but we just usually play it with three& which works fine& and it still works with two."
9136,2792,3," These cards were brought as a present and has given us all hours of fun and laughter.  A very small but playful gift and has been easy to transport across the family houses"
9137,2792,4," Hasbro Card Game - Cranium CardsI bought this for my niece as a christmas present. She is a bright 8 year old that loves expressing herself. These cards encompass performing& writing& drawing& describing and spelling - driven by the use of the imagination& and prompted by the cards. The game can be played from 8 yrs upwards as a team game or individually. One set of cards suggests an activity& the other set suggests a way of expression - performing& drawing& describing or spelling backwards! Enjoy.."
9138,2793,5," Excellent quality box (hard wearing plastic). Easily holds a fully sleeved deck and expansions. Beautiful art."
9139,2793,5," Perfect size to hold my small collection of cards and carry things around. Holds two deck boxes very nicely. Promo card is a little different"
9140,2793,5," Great box& great promo card."
9141,2794,4," I bought these cards (Pokemon Arceus Theme Deck Platinum Arceus Flamemaster) as part of my son's birthday present. They are far cheaper (Â£[] + free delivery) than in toy shops - and easier to find + available.I have no idea what they are about for& as Pokemon is not really my thing(!)& but he was delighted& we got a bargain.Catherine R"
9142,2794,5," My son loved it& so did I.  He was playing with it for hours& so I would recommend it to parents who want to keep their kids occupied."
9143,2794,4," Obviously not for me but for my son who assures me that Arceus is everything!!  The price is not too bad& even if it is a packet of cardboard but my son has endless hours of fun and trading with these so I'm a happy mum."
9144,2795,5," Great for any little City fan and anything that gets them off the iPad for any length of time gets a thumbs up from me! Simple but effective! Fast delivery from a great seller would definately recommend."
9145,2795,5," My son really enjoys playing this game.  A good buy."
9146,2795,5," Disappointed that they can't bring out the current 2014-15 team cards& however my son thinks this is product is great. Yes I can hear the sniggering in the background. It's also good to sit down with the children& telly off& games consoles idle for a few hours and dream the dream& have fun and laugh."
9147,2795,4," Arrived on good time kids love them"
9148,2796,5," very good and very good value& just need to find out the cheapest way to send to friends in Japan with gift card and letter"
9149,2797,4," These are a great little item& well presented& interesting& just what it says in the info& BUT it doesn't tell you that they are made in the US for the US market and therefore many of the questions relate to artists/tv shows& etc from the States& which for me is really disappointing being from and in the UK!!!!"
9150,2798,5," The Metal Horse  Bicycle Deck was released to celebrate the Year of The Horse in 2014.(So the cards were actually published in 2013)They really are an elegant looking pack.If you want to know what the other  'Horse' years were so that you may give the pack as a thoughtful gift  they were"
9151,2799,5," fantastic addition to my Fluxx collection!"
9152,2800,5," cards are brilliant  our grandson had fun playing with them. I would recommend them to our friends thank you for the fun"
9153,2800,5," grandchildren love playing with these cards a good size and excellent value for money arrived before date given would recommend them"
9154,2800,5," santa brought these for my son he was delighted.  pictures very clear and bright and cards are fairly thick so they are great.we also received an extra card in the pack"
9155,2800,5," Bought with other card games for grandsons& this was they&re favourite as it quick"
9156,2800,5," Quick delivery and great pack of snap cards for young kids Nice and big cards with clear pictures with different colour backgrounds which makes it a lot easier for little kids. Kids love them!"
9157,2800,5," Really good sized cards and substantial thickness.  My grandchildren are really enjoying playing with them.  Thank you very much& and for the early delivery"
9158,2800,5," Granddaughters just love big cards and matching the excellent colourful pictures. They ask to play each time I visit and often sit just looking at the pictures one at a time. Unbelievably cheap for really good product."
9159,2800,5," I got these cards for my grandchildren who are always looking for something new to do when they visit. They are a good size and easy to handle. They were very inexpensive but will& i think& last a while although i dont think the box they cane in will. All in all a good item for not a lot of money"
9160,2801,4," This is a fantastic set for hosting small games& but if you want to play with 8 people you'll definitely need more chips (this should be obvious). I've purchased several sets of chips before and in my honest opinion they're not the best chips I've owned& but they are good. They have a nice weight to them. The box they come in is a nice finish compared to the alternative cheap |aluminium| sets you can buy. Also the cards are actually good! Often cards are very poor quality in small poker sets& not in this case.The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that some of the chips have slight imperfections& like colour bleed. Not all and not a lot but it's something I feel I should mention.Overall a fantastic set for the price"
9161,2801,5," I must confess I had my doubts when I first purchased this but now I've received it I am over the moon. The quality of the set is really good with a nice box& heavy chips and very good quality cards - I didn't realise this but my friend told me that Cartamundi are a very big card manufacturer. We have been playing every weekend with friends and it has been great. Ideally the chips are okay for around 4-5 people but you can also purchase additional chips from the same manufacturer if you have larger groups. I would highly recommend this set."
9162,2801,5," Chips are heavier than expected& so very good. An ideal starter set for promising poker players. ok ok ok ok."
9163,2801,2," I bought this as a present and would be very happy with it except it came without the playing cards when it is clearly advertised that there should be 2 packs."
9164,2801,5," Really nice set& good weight to the chips and the box is nice and solid. Makes poker night a bit more like Vegas!"
9165,2801,5," This set is a full house. Flushes out the competition& would purchase this straight away."
9166,2802,5," Good item very quick delivery"
9167,2803,4," This card (deck-building) game& is very interesting.It beats Race to the Galaxy& Dominion and Thunderstone.I really like this game& and in my opinion& you are never bored and always thinking ahead.This is the best deck-building games& in my opinion& however& I still miss (like I do in all deck-building games)more interactions between the players& for instance I would love to provoke/harass/outplay/slowdown/place obstacles or even just be able to remove my opponent from the leading position& somehow.When this is said& the game still works perfectly and I enjoy it every time& not my favorite game& however I would recommend it if you love card-games!Last note: Awesome n' outstanding layout and quality!"
9168,2803,5," Components â€“ really nice components& plastic ships& thick card stock â€“ really impressive.Game play â€“ A single play through will get most people up and running. If you get stuck just YouTube it and watch the â€˜watch it playedâ€™ video (or enough to get the turn sequence down).Only played 2 player so far. The games are very close â€“ this makes the game a great game in my opinion. I find my ability to min/max strategy can sometimes destroy the fun of a competative game - especially if its got a single killer strategy.I have only played a few times but I tried out what I thought was the â€˜killerâ€™ strategy against the missus early on. I failed - I now understand that this game needs you to play the other player and the cards they play or hold as much as playing to your own strategic strengths. When I min-maxed down one path my wife 'played' me. It was still extremely close& and we both thought I was going to win when my killer combo's kicked  in and I got heaps of late game VP - but in the end my wife won through limiting my effectiveness. To me this was a real treat. I love it when other people see things I dont - it was really sweet.Iâ€™m not sure how well this game would scale but I have a suspicion that it would work okay in a 3 or 4. It may be geared more heavily to strategic choice though as with 4 players going at different strategies& the likelihood is that defensive plays may be negatedâ€¦"
9169,2803,4," I'm a fairly casual gamer and I bought this as a gift for my other half& who had researched it on Board Game Geek.  We'd previously played Race for the Galaxy& and to me this seemed like a nice game with some similarities to RftG and also some resemblance to Dominion."
9170,2804,3," Lovely cards and nice idea however it is a much smaller pack than I expected for the Â£5 I paid and the box was a bit battered. For Â£2 or Â£3 I would have been more than happy"
9171,2804,5," Only shame is that letters are not so clear but niece loves it. Used some of the pack to introduce the game and building up to full pack"
9172,2804,5," Bought as a present shame they weren't large cards but am sure they will be well used"
9173,2804,5," A must for a frozen fan! My daughter loves these."
9174,2804,5," perfect for my granddaughter"
9175,2805,1," It is wrong!!!It says that Machu Picchu is in Mexico!"
9176,2805,4," Good alternative to the other World gAmes & especially linking foods to countries. Shame there are some which don't have any foods associated with them e.g Australia"
9177,2805,5," A very interesting and educational game for older children(and adults) but can be used with younger children purely for fun but with recognition happening which hopefully will come out later. Clear illustrations on good quality cards."
9178,2805,5," Great& affordable and educational game for my 7 and 8 year olds. Collecting the whole series!"
9179,2805,5," Great way to learn basic geography and have fun at the same time"
9180,2805,4," 8-9 year old granddaughters love this."
9181,2806,5," I was introduced to (original) Munchkin by a friend& and was bought SuperMunchkin as a gift. I love the 'Dungeons and Dragons' style of gameplay when mixed with the satire and humour characteristic in all the Munchkin games. However& I'd certainly recommend buying at least one expansion pack for Munchkin& SuperMunchkin& and the other games ('Narrow 'S' Cape' is the only add-on available for SuperMunchkin) as otherwise your group will have to reshuffle and reuse the same cards each game - especially if you play with more than 4 people. With a new selection of additional equipment& traps and monsters& you can be sure that the combined decks of SuperMunchkin and 'Narrow 'S' Cape' will be sufficient for all but the most drawn out struggles for power!"
9182,2807,4," a great twist on the original game and easily transportable too& recommend to anyone who likes games& especially if drawing is not your strong point!"
9183,2807,4," Took this game on holiday& it was good fun to play as a group but you need space to allow for any large mimes!"
9184,2807,5," fantastic easy forgot how competitive games can be - great fun for the hole family to play anywhere - recommend for those big kids too"
9185,2807,4," Great fun to play and more portable"
9186,2807,5," Great for travelling!Delivery was right on time too."
9187,2807,4," What I wanted but have not played yet as it is a gift"
9188,2808,4," If you see the circle part of Alaya's arm& DO NOT BEND! I did that by accident on the first day. But if you have also ordered the Pandorica& do not worry: it comes with Alaya again."
9189,2809,4," Great little game& quick to learn and easy to play"
9190,2810,5," Arrived on time&of good quality and value for money."
9191,2811,5," Great Bicycle cards&"
9192,2812,5," I love Top Trumps and I love BBT& so these were an essential buy. You get the top 30? Bazinga moments (voted for by whom& I wonder) I have my own personal favourites in the selection& where as others& I feel there are more funnier moments from the series. I don't think it's a general purchase pack& by that I mean I think most people who buy this will be fans of the show. Whilst obviously no prior knowledge of BBT is needed to play& for me personally& having that knowledge and having seen the episodes these moments come from& enhance the fun."
9193,2812,1," The criteria used to determine the scores on the cards was useless& this is a major design flaw.  I had hoped the cards would give strengths and weaknesses of the characters we all love and possibly give more information about each character for the avid fan& including some of the less common characters. But they don't& they rate some scenes or events in the series which is purely subjective.  Very disappointed in the product."
9194,2812,5," Whats to say? Love top trumps from your childhood? Love Big Bang theory? Well this combines both!  Lets face is top trumps are a fun way for car journeys& holiday games or just having fun with at home."
9195,2812,5," The pack of Top Trumps is perhaps my favourite yet.  It really helps capture the joy of the show and is& as all Top Trumps games are& easy to learn and fun to play."
9196,2812,3," Fast delivery etc. But random as to what you play trumps with/compare. It's episodes so you need to be a real fan to enjoy it!"
9197,2812,4," This product is& as it was described and has made an excellent present for a young big bang theory fan"
9198,2812,5," Bought these for my daughter who loves the Big Bang Theory and she was thrilled to bits."
9199,2812,5," love big bang so the cards are a good addition to our big bang addiction!"
9200,2813,5," Great set of cards you get all your super  heroes in the pa k very colourful strong highly recommended."
9201,2814,5," This is a lovely set of top trumps cards which any Frozen fan is bound to like. You get thirty cards in the set. We have found that they are really good in the car and keep children quietly entertained.Recommended."
9202,2814,4," Yet another item for my neighbour and she is extremely pleased with the Amazon shopping experience"
9203,2814,5," We played Top Trumps when our sons were young with cars& they very much used to enjoy it. When I saw it on Amazon& I got the Frozen Top Trump cards for our grandson as a stocking filler at Christmas& he loved it as did my son& husband& daughter in law and me ! He soon learnt which cards had the highest value !"
9204,2814,5," What can I say...it's classic Top Trumps but with Frozen characters. I bought this for a friend and we very much enjoyed it (although I warn you now& the |Arundelle Baby| doesn't score too highly...). If you love Frozen& this is a great little game. Very portable and good for filling in the gaps."
9205,2814,5," Great fun. These cards have all the characters. Good price too."
9206,2814,5," My grandchildren had been asking for top trumps for ages and I gave it to them as a stocking present since when they have been playing with them tirelessly - the fact that they also are wild about Frozen adds to their enjoyment"
9207,2814,5," My children love to play 'Top Trumps'& between them they own many packs& and never tire of playing it.To be able to buy Frozen ones is great& and will make a nice surprise for my daughter for Christmas."
9208,2814,5," At Last!!! The pack of Top Trumps my daughters have been waiting for. By chance I saw that the pack was available on Amazon as we had not seen anything in the  shops but in am sure they will be there soon. Needless to say my girls are over the moon with the pack and now every time they watch the movie& out come the cards. A Must for all Frozenites"
9209,2815,4," Makes you look very impressive!Doesn't take too much getting used too and is one of the only gimmicks I've never had anybody figure out!I only had one problem which was returning it once because the backs weren't rough enough& but once I got it back it was excellent!I recommend this deck to anyone."
9210,2815,4," Exactly as described& comes with distructions& seriosuly hard to get right if you have smooth un-grubby hands like me but got the hang of it in the end& check out Thecardtrickteacher.com for a nice video on how to use them& the principle being"
9211,2815,5," well put together and beautifully simple to use with a bit of practice& I would reccomend to any magician& begginner to advanced. Its a critical piece of kit to any performer and is one of the most intriguing and famous illusions to perform."
9212,2815,5," My grandson loved this and has played tricks on everyone he meets.  It can obviously only be played once or twice on each person but a good way for young children to learn magic."
9213,2815,5," Fantastic pack of cards without giving anything away the mechanics of this trick are truly amazing& and with little practice you will be pleased with the results."
9214,2815,5," These cards lived up to my grandsons expectations and entertained the family really well.  He hopes to get some others from the same series."
9215,2815,4," This was a Christmas present for my sonVery Happy with this purchase"
9216,2815,4," Fast delivery. Generally considered to be a magicians fav trick. Personally i dont use it much& but it gets a good reception when i do"
9217,2816,5," The Bicycle Vintage |Dragon Back| Deck is a really smart looking pack but with the Blue deck they really have taken it to a new high.The big attraction is that the Red Pips- Hearts and Diamonds are in a smart blue.This always impresses and I have some of my best tricks on this colour switch.The Court cards have a great look with a toned metallic green which looks- well regal.Of course the big attraction is the card backs which it is reputed is an old design filed and forgotten for years then rediscovered by a worker at Bicycle.They liked the design and chose to release it to the public.This is an attractive and impressive deck for magicians the sheen looks really professional.Certainly when I use it for tricks it really gets the trick off to a good start if you have a great looking deck like this.The red dragons give and Oriental air of mystery so to speak.There is an additional 'Gaff' card.It's double backed so nothing to write home about but an extra which is always welcome.The back includes a couple of 'Trade' cards which are always useful if you need to make your own Gaffs.In actions the cards perform well.They fan out and are easily manipulated as are all Bicycle brands. The airflow ensures the slide easily.I used to used 'Bee' brand for many years. Bee are a subsidiary of Bicycle but I must admit I prefer to use Bicycle.A really smart looking deck that performs well.The cards are also available in Blue.The Bicycle Vintage |Dragon Back| Deck is a really smart looking pack.The Court cards have a great look with a toned metallic green which looks- well regal.Read more â€º"
9218,2816,5," the look and feel of the deck is sooo good i love the design and instead of the hearts and diamonds being red there dark blue!!!if your considering buying this deck for you or for a gift it defiantly will not disappoint"
9219,2816,4," The only down side is the blue printing can be a little distracting while playing.  Although it may put other people off and you may win& so that could be a good thing."
9220,2816,5," I must say this is one of the best card decks I have ever tested& it is brilliant for Riffle Shuffling& has a very durable stalk and will last at the mininum of 2 years& it is a MUST buy& the air-cushion finish is flawless and has a beautiful degsin. BUY BUY BUY!!!!!"
9221,2816,4," these cards seem like lovely& really good quality cards. only thing is& they're so shiny that for travel purposes& or for playing cards on the bed& they're really really slippy slidey.anyways& great cards. just not suited for my purpose"
9222,2816,5," A quality deck of cards. Doesn't feel cheaply made at all. I think the blue colour scheme is a nice break from the traditional red& yet it still has the same authenticity as your typical quality red deck of cards. 10 out of 10!"
9223,2817,4," A good little game that doesn't take long to set up and is quick to play for two players. The art work and card stock are great. It's a good introduction to the Ascension game and leaves you wanting more."
9224,2817,4," box was terrible when it arrived. look like it has been used as a ball in a game of catch. game its self its great and this purchase made me buy one of the bigger boxed versions."
9225,2817,4," Fast fun& very good value for money"
9226,2818,5," arrived on time and kids loved them"
9227,2818,5," My son is a big Pokemon fan and he loves this deck as much as his others"
9228,2818,5," this was a present for my grandson who loved them just what he wanted"
9229,2819,5," Accurately described and promptly delivered. Highly recommended."
9230,2819,5," As described"
9231,2820,5," This is the perfect companion to your Vanguard Deck& the artwork is perfect and it's the best thing to keep your cards safe"
9232,2821,5," Fun games"
9233,2822,5," After buying the Core Set I decided to buy an expansion and was not disappointed. It is& however& important to note that both Eldar races only get a new commander with signature cards - that said& I loved both the artwork and stats/abilities. Like all the War Packs - value for money."
9234,2822,4," Bought as a present"
9235,2822,3," On the tin."
9236,2823,5," A good family game& quite expensive though."
9237,2824,4," Good fun"
9238,2825,5," Brilliant! My girls (aged 6/9/10 when we first bought it) have played this loads& especially on a camping holiday round Europe. All the Gamewright card games are great because they're essentially so simple& yet they have a design and wit about them that makes them very appealing. This game was inspired by an idea from a girl of about 6 and her (games inventor) dad so they've got the target market exactly right. A safe buy for a girls' birthday& I would say."
9239,2825,5," I can but endorse previous reviewers comments and try to add some more. Gamewright's card games are based on tradional card games with a twist and obviously a totally different set of cards. Sleeping Queens appealed instinctively to both my 6 year old son and 8 yar old daughter. We play it endlessly and it's one of those games that will be treasured and passed down generations. It's portable and absorbing and never fails to be a popular option from both adults and children's points of view. It's simple but keeps all sorts of people interested in playing. We will certainly be investing in more of Gamewright's games."
9240,2825,5," My little niece (I don't think my sister would like me to use her name) is a delightful child at best& but doesn't like losing. I was a bit apprehensive about introducing her to a new game& because I was afraid that if she didn't win she would have a tantrum. To my great relief& though& she and her nine-year-old brother had a great time with it. The game itself is easy to learn (though admittedly my niece often had help)& the pictures delightful& and play contains plenty of chances for the lead to change hands without being too random. The authors have done particularly good work in making sure the rules are clear. At one point& in a round when the winning score was 40 points& I scored 45. My niece shouted |You broke the roo-els!| I referred to the leaflet in the box& and there is a roo-el which says that you don't have to have that exact number of points to win: just to have that much or better. As well as playing it with the adults& the children also played it by themselves& which I felt was a sign of its success. As the game involves only cards& it would be easy to take on journeys to play in a train or aircraft& though I haven't let my sister remove it from this house because it was so popular here. The minimum age limit of 8 is probably sensible& because it requires arithmetic& but as the queen cards which have the scores on them don't have to be kept secret it is quite possible for a child who can't add to leave them out in the open and have someone else add the scores up. Strongly recommended."
9241,2825,5," We love Sleeping Queens.My 9 year old daughter always enjoys this well produced card game.It combines the two elements essential for a good game: you need luck and judgement to win. Almost any age can play and it's a great family activity. Each game should not really take longer than 5-10 minutes & so it doesn't drag on.Whimisical and eccentric illustrations and characters maintain a level of charm."
9242,2825,5," We were told about this game by a Canadian friend. Her children all love it and so I purchased a pack for my son(age 9). This is an enchanting game - with a beautiful story regarding it's invention. We play it all the time and I would highly recommend it as an interesting and fun option to the interminable computer games that all kids seem to be addicted to these days."
9243,2825,5," Sleeping Queens is currently our family's favourite card game& requested over and over again by our 5yo and (almost) 8yo and equally enjoyed by us parents. While the age recommendation is from 8 years& our 5yo has no problems with the rules and tactics of the game (although she does need help with basic addition which is a minor component). Highly recommended& as well as the other Gamewright card games& where the ones we have tried all have great staying power:- Duck Duck Bruce (simple push your luck game& perfect from as early as 3-4 and great fun for adults as well& our favourite after Sleeping Queens& perfect to bring to restaurants/airports)- Zeus on the loose (great fun and a game we happily play with our 8yo& but slightly higher age bracket than Sleeping Queen as addition skills are needed (although of course children learn unknowingly as they play...))- Rat a Tat Cat (the first Gamewright game we tried with our then 5&5 yo& a firm favourite for a year or so until displaced by Duck Duck Bruce& but still very much recommended.)(Come to think of it& we have also tried Too Many Monkeys which is quite uninteresting& at least to adults. Try the above ones instead.)"
9244,2825,5," My daughter was given this for her 8th birthday& having played it with a friend previously. We have all enjoyed playing it - adults and her 6 year old brother alike. Each time is different so it doesn't get boring. I would say that most 6 year olds would grasp this fairly easily so don't be put off by the 8+ advice. A well thought out clever fun game. I have bought several as birthday presents now and am looking at the other card games by this company for next year's gifts!"
9245,2825,5," We bought this for our 6 year old for her birthday based on review here and have not been disappointed. Our three children (age 7&6 and 3) picked up the rules very quickly and are always keen to play.This game has appealed in particular to our 3 1/2 year old. Although she cannot do the adding up bits she is fiercely competative and is able to follow all the other rules. It is helping her to learn (slowly) about losing as well especially when playing with her siblings.This is a great game for travel as it packs up small and we have spent many a train journey playing - highly recommend."
9246,2826,5," These cards have been widely recommended for magicians& so as a budding magician I decided to purchase them. They do take some getting used to (they slide about a lot because of the |air-cushion finish|. However& once you're comfortable with handling them& they work like a dream. They look professional and add to the overall image of the magician.I don't know how I coped without them."
9247,2826,5," They're standard Bicycle blue back playing cards. Or red. Not sure if it's random. The quality is what you'd expect from USPCC& but I would say standard Bicycle cards are quite stiff compared to more premium packs. For a couple of pounds you can afford to abuse these to death& if you like them buy the 2/4 packs from other suppliers. They'll make your hands tough."
9248,2826,5," I like the smell of a new deck of cards so I ordered these which I have seen the fancy American Magicians use on the TV BOX.The cards arrived promptly and sealed in their original cellophane. The box was ever so slightly creased at the lower left corner but was merely superficial and likely caused in transit.The cards smelled beautiful and I plan o order more when I want to smell them fresh again. I find the smell from one pack can last for up to 2 months from depending on how often you smell them.Very satisfied."
9249,2826,5," Came in 2 days !Best Cards I've ever held& good packaging and now my friends have found bicycle and love them too ! Great buy"
9250,2826,5," the quality of the card is awesome and the price are very cheap in the market i suppose so strong recommend the goods"
9251,2826,5," THESE CARDS ARE AMAZING BRILL FINISH GOOD DURABILITY ALLROUND GOOD CARDS HIGHLY RECOMEND THEM THEY'RE BRILL!!!!!!! GET THEM !!!!! THEY'RE FAB!!!!!"
9252,2826,5," bought it as a gift for my elder brother and he liked it."
9253,2827,5," Like many people& I had heard of the card game Uno& but didn't really know anything about it or how it was played. This changed last summer& when we went on holiday as a family to Whitby. Six of us were staying in a self catering cottage& and my mother in law was singing the praises of this card game that she had been playing a couple of weeks earlier when she visited her sister& saying it would be the perfect game to play as a family indoorsif it was raining (which it was!).She managed to pick one up from the local toy shop for Â£[]& which seemed a bit of a steep price to pay for what was essentially a pack of cards! The game is made by Mattel& brand leaders in the games industry and is suitable for 2-10 players. The box states that it is for ages 7+& but I think most kids over 4 would manage the game relatively easily& as it is quite simple.The game itself is very similar to a card game that we used to play with a regular deck of cards& in which someone puts a card down and the next player has to follow suit or number and if they can't they have to pick up a card. The winner is the person to get rid of all of his/her cards first.Uno have simplified the game further& replacing the traditional suits of cards with four bold colours: blue& green& yellow and red. Most of the cards have number values on them from 0 to 9. A set number of cards are dealt to each player& with the remainder forming a pickup pile on the table. The aim of the game is to play clockwise around the table& with each player placing a card that matches the number or colour of the previous card placed& with the object of losing all of his/her cards.Read more â€º"
9254,2827,3," I'm not sure if this is genuine or fake as I saw other people saying the cards have been plastified but as far as I can tell it's just like ordinary playing cards& made of paper& the yellow cards are very light and hard to see.  Also I noticed that on the back of the package it has |Maximum retail price: â‚¹129 | and the manufactory address is India I guess& what's worse the instruction inside I noticed a typo in |Going out| section& read |If you don't yell 'UND'| ?? it clearly printed 'UND' as opposed to |UNO|.I can still use this cards but I'm not sure if this is the geniune UNO cards"
9255,2827,5," I have loved playing this for many years. I bought this new copy when my son headed up to university& now the fun is being spread to he north of Scotland. Easy and addictive age which can be played by the very young and old alike& endearing as there are very few rules. A great game to carry in a pocket for long trips or days out."
9256,2827,5," Keeps children entertained for ages on holiday - great game and all age of children seem to understand the concept of it!"
9257,2827,5," First showed this game by friends it's a lot of fun and the games don't go on too longGood cheap fun"
9258,2827,4," My daughter wanted this as she had been playing it at her After School Club. She's quite a expert tactician with it now. Read the reviews about it being some sort of unofficial version. I don't believe this to be the case. The box and the cards are of high quality. Didn't need to read the instructions as we already knew how to play it. Only downside (and hence the 4 stars) is that the cards don't shuffle well like playing cards should. It's as if the card is too thick or has too blunt an edge. However I am sure with plenty of use they will become more pliable and shuffle more easily."
9259,2827,5," Uno is a fantastic family card game that's really stood the test of time.I can remember enthusiastically playing this as a child& and now my children received it for Christmas we play it just as enthusiastically as a family.  The rules are so simple& they're almost self-explanatory"
9260,2827,1," I opened this pack of cards for the first time today& 17th February& only to find that these cards are imperfect. The colours of the cards are not correct& some are torn and others have markings missing. When I purchased the cards it did not say that they were imperfect. Look forward to your comments"
9261,2828,5," Good service and cards were as a gift that made the recipient very happy. Attractive design and boxed to keep them safe and all together. second purchase of this brand."
9262,2828,5," These cards are top quality and I am very pleased with them. Have used them quite a bit and they are still like new.Would certainly use this company again."
9263,2828,5," Delivery speed was as estimated and the packaging was fine. Product itself is very good. Paisley design is very elegant and different from the default."
9264,2828,5," The finest quality cards."
9265,2828,5," kem alwyas the best"
9266,2829,4," Jack& Queen& King& one of the aces& and the two jokers& are the only real highlight of this pack. The box is consistent with the aesthetic. But these cards seem to bend way too easily that after a few hands some of the cards are sporting a noticeable curve. Either way& they do make a nice change to the pointless illustrations of most other decks. Curious about the lack of variation on the aces however."
9267,2830,5," These Bicyle Cards have great colours and handle and spread really well. They arrived really quickly too.  Very many thanks."
9268,2831,4," The tin contains two set of playing cards with illustrations from the first four Harry Potter books. I liked it very much& especially the coloured illustrations on the Jacks& Queens& Kings and Aces& which are by Mary GrandPrÃ© (I think. It's certainly in her style).Each colour has illustrations from one of the books (f.i. the spades have illustrations from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire). The illustrations on the numbers are a lot more plain. Some of those are still very nice& although I think others could have been better (hence 4 stars instead of 5)."
9269,2832,5," These were amazing so small and perfect really happy with the product and really quick for delivery - ordered for Halloween and came in days :-)"
9270,2833,5," The Jungle speed was put on a box with the fragile sign outside and wrapped with a bubble protective. The game itself was as described having 80 cards and a wooden totem. The price is quite revelant with the one in stores. It also arrived within 8-9 days from when i ordered. Overall excellent deal and i would reccomend it"
9271,2833,4," Difficult instructions& and rather hard to pick up& but after you establish the rules& it is a very fast and fun game to play"
9272,2833,5," Bought this for my friend. We all love playing here and it was the most successful technique for making new friends and killing boredom (or more to the point procrastinating) at uni xD. (Note& friends won't just suddenly appear because you own this). We've only had a few casualties from the totem flying into people's eyes nearly"
9273,2834,4," This is a fine deck of cards form the bicycle company with black backing (traditionally considered equivalent to blue).Fairly durable not as much as cellusose cards (which I hate the feel of) but the aircusion system works amazingly well as usual.You wont regret buying a bicycle deck no matter what you intend to do with them (other than simply burning them)."
9274,2834,5," These are great playing cards. Bicycle cards are without a doubt the best playing cards you can get for magic. The black looks great on the cards. would definitely recommend these :)"
9275,2834,5," Toy should not be used to describe these professional cards. My son is very much into magic card tricks and thinks these are wonderful"
9276,2834,5," My son absolutely loves these cards.  I don't know why he needs so many but he is collecting as many as he can.  They are a cut above other packs of cards.  I can see how easily they glide with the air cushioning finish.  Excellent."
9277,2834,5," What can you say other than these are great cards for the weekly poker game?.Will also add to another reviewer who recommends these for magicians& as my brother in law loves these for close in magic tricks....."
9278,2834,5," I love bicycle cards and these are just another great pack to add to my collection& good delivery& decent price and great feel and handling. love them& and would highly recomend"
9279,2834,5," I love these cards a lot. They are air cushioned& hard wearing and a beautiful unique back& recommend these to magicians& and black jackers."
9280,2834,2," Let me start by saying these are noticeably high quality cards. They feel nice in the hand and are not too smooth or to rough gliding over one another nicely however regrettably I must say I do not like these cards. If you have no preference to whether cards are stiff or flexible then this review should be ignored. However for those who like me enjoy to riffle shuffle without breaking their hands and tend to prefer cards that don't look misshapen after a few shuffles these cards are not for you."
9281,2835,4," Good value for a starter pack& a nice mix of cards to get your deck started. While it doesn't contain many collectables it shouldn't disappoint. If you are looking for more exclusive cards you will have to pay more but that doesn't detract from the value."
9282,2836,4," Charades is a classic game to play at Christmas and these cards add a really fun Disney twist that the whole family can enjoy.  In the box you receive 25 â€˜I amâ€™ Cards& 25 â€˜Whoâ€™ Card& 1 Blue Die& 1 Red Die& 1 Timer and a set of rules.The game did take my 7 year old son a while to understand as it is not as straightforward as just acting out a character.  The first player takes both an â€˜I amâ€™ card and a â€˜Whoâ€™ card and rolls the two dice to see which of the two selections on each card they will be acting out.  The player then has to act out an â€˜actionâ€™ as the character on the card they have chosen.  Their team then has to guess who you are as well as what you are doing and& if they get it right& your team wins a point.  You have 1 minute to try and guess using the timer provided.  As well as miming you can also make noises to make it a little easier.The game is aimed at players aged 6+ which I would say is about right.  Once we had played a few rounds my son started to grasp what he was to do and could play it well.  Although my 3 year old daughter couldnâ€™t play properly she did have fun pretending to be a princess!The game is suitable for 4-10 players though I donâ€™t really suppose it matters how many people are playing& you could have bigger teams if you wanted.We have really enjoyed playing this game.  The quality of the pieces is good and I think it is great value for money.  I can see it being a game that we play for some time to come.I received this game in return for my honest blog review."
9283,2837,4," A very fun game& if you are thinking of buying it don't be put off that the rules can change while playing (within this deck there aren't too many new rule cards& it has the original ones such as draw 'x'& play 'x' and hand limits) if you are looking to play this with a younger audience maybe 'family fluxx' would be more suited& I've played Star fluxx which is also very fun but eco is my favourite and it somewhat educations for youngsters!"
9284,2837,5," I'll admit I'd already played the original Fluxx alot. Then my wife got me this for a birthday gift. It's perfect.The cards are nice and nature themed - a big plus since I'm a keen gardener.I'd say this is a fairly simple game once you'd played 3 or 4 times. It's just a matter of experience and knowing what each card can do. The box is just a little bigger than a deck of cards so it's always under the coffee table waiting to be played."
9285,2837,5," I love the Fluxx games :O)  this one is great fun as the Creeper cards really do fit the eco ethos"
9286,2837,5," loads of fun!"
9287,2838,5,""
9288,2839,2," good idea but its basically its just a pack of cards with one word written on the back..for example |spiky| and they have to find something spiky. You could easily make this at home yourself! Very expensive for what it is."
9289,2839,5," Amazing ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ»ðŸ‘ðŸ» defernatly a must have for young children who love the out doors. My son played for nearly 2 hours and wanted to carry on he enjoyed touching smelling and looking for the objects he managed to find all of the cards brilliant ðŸ‘ðŸ»"
9290,2839,1," very disappointed this is very small basically just like a pack of cards in a draw string bag- not worth the money."
9291,2839,5," Smaller bag than I imagined but the concept is great. Can't fault it. Sometimes we get stuck for ideas when out and about but this won't get old for a very long time. Great fun."
9292,2839,5," What a great idea to encourage children to get out and walk.  My young grandsons& having been reluctant to get out of the house soon got into the swing of things and really enjoyed the game.  It opened up conversations about some of the things we found and was a great learning exercise.  Simple fun - the 3 year old got so excited when shortly after taking the 'something smelly' card he found a pile of horse manure!  Now he feels he's an expert on what horses eat.  We'll be able to use these cards again and again.  Well worth the money"
9293,2839,4," great for getting children up and exploring! could be useful for forest school/activities but also useful in the class for language support."
9294,2839,5," Brilliant for my toddler. Can be taken anywhere and keeps him entertained and hunting for different items each time."
9295,2839,4," Fantastic fun for my nephews& in a bid to get them away from computer gaming - this has worked brilliantly."
9296,2840,5," Great set"
9297,2841,3," On the plus side:- Game is fast paced& can change quickly and provides twists and turns- It provides some number practice with adding of numbers& rounding to nearest 10 and reversing numbers- God theme is fun and engagingHowever:- A lot of luck is involved with winning& however well you play- Opportunities for strategic thinking are limited due to the luck in which cards your opponents happen to haveOverall:- Not the most satisfying game- As a family we've enjoyed and played other GameWright games far more e.g. Loot& Rat-a-tat Cat"
9298,2841,5," This addictive game combines a great theme (Greek mythology) with good tactics and some basic math thrown in. It plays quickly and we often bring it out with our 8yo son& equally enjoyed by him and us adults.Highly recommended& as well as the other Gamewright card games& where the ones we have tried all have great staying power:- Sleeping Queens is currently our family's favourite card game& requested over and over again by our 5yo and (almost) 8yo and equally enjoyed by us parents. While the age recommendation is from 8 years& our 5yo has no problems with the rules and tactics of the game (although she does need help with basic addition which is a minor component).- Duck Duck Bruce (simple push your luck game& perfect from as early as 3-4 and great fun for adults as well& our favourite after Sleeping Queens& perfect to bring to restaurants/airports)- Rat a Tat Cat (the first Gamewright game we tried with our then 5&5 yo& a firm favourite for a year or so until displaced by Duck Duck Bruce& but still very much recommended.)Frog Juice also get great reviews& will be ordering it for Christmas this year!(Come to think of it& we have also tried Too Many Monkeys which is quite uninteresting& at least to adults. Try the above ones instead.)"
9299,2841,5," I am a mum and a secondary school maths teacher and all the children I have played Zeus on the Loose with absolutely love it.  My son is 6 and manages to play independently.  When we play at school maths club play is a bit more fast and furious.  My children like Percy Jackson and Horrible Histories and like the Greek god cards.  It's good for mental maths and thinking strategically.When purchasing this I thought it seemed expensive for a card game& but we've played this so much& that I have truly had good value for money."
9300,2841,5," This is a proper& fun game that my children really love to play.  It involves some strategy and luck& like all good card games. While playing the game children are practising their numberbonds and adding 1 digit numbers to 2 digit numbers.  My special needs child loves playing this and has made real progress with his addition skill.  I'm now desperate to find something that's as much fun for other maths targets!"
9301,2841,5," We got this game to play with our 7"
9302,2841,5," My son loves this game and it is suitable to play with a range of ages of children. It helps mental maths in terms of quick adding and knowing the next ten in a sequence and is fast and fun. The Greek characters have been described in a fun way which also links to school Greek topic work! Would definately recommend!"
9303,2841,5," Great game. Not only are the cards well made and the concept of mathermatics adding and subtractiing to reach 100 relovant in reinforcing mental arithmetic. The taking of turns and sequencing while also getting my children 13 7 5  to research some greek gods made the game a big hit in our house."
9304,2841,5," This is a fab and engaging game designed to help kids with their addition and times table. A great way to get kids to do maths without realising it. Had played this game at a family learning session at school and just had to order it for home."
9305,2842,5," My daughter ( aged 9) just didn't get how fractions and precentages related to eachother. I had tried various things and explanations and tears often ensued. I bought these 'snap cards'  and just left them with her. She ignored them for weeks& then I came up one night when she should have been asleep and she had them spread all over the bedcovers. We had a game of snap ( better than a telling off I suppose she reckoned) and she soon started to get the idea and in a few days was proudly showing how she could instantly spot fractions and matching percentages. Great! I'm going back to buy lots more of this range!"
9306,2842,5," For a child who has trouble visualising percentages& decimals& fractions etc. This is ideal.Good clear images that make math interesting.An ideal educational aid."
9307,2842,5," I spotted these in a shop and knew they'd be great for my bottom set year 7's& I'm going to buy more from the range.  It's a great resource to end a lesson with"
9308,2842,5," With SATs fast approaching and my daughter still struggling with fractions& I thought I'd do the right thing and throw some money at Amazon to try to inject some fun into learning!  To my surprise& this actually worked.  We had a nice little game of pairs last night.  She was engaged and calm and seemed to be making the connections without too much trouble. The cards feature fractions represented as percentages& in picture form& in words and as a fraction. I don't think they are in decimal form as well - that would be useful& but perhaps it would make it too difficult.  Good purchase.  I think we will be playing this often over the next few weeks."
9309,2842,5," my daughter has problems with maths.  great little game to help make learning fun."
9310,2842,5," AMAZING|. FANTASIC for teaching young people and making it fun & it an enjoyable game with more than one style of playing it& worth the price and simply fantastic i cant wait to do this with my younger brother !!"
9311,2842,5," This is an excellent game to play both at home and in the classroom.  The children love it!  Have used many snap games in this range and they are all popular."
9312,2842,5," We've only played pairs with these cards so far& but my daughter enjoys the game. She's only 6 and so struggles to match some of the fractions (0.1 equals 1/10) but we work them out together. I think the more we play it& the more familiar she will be with the pairs - which is the whole point! A great learning aid& especially if your child enjoys playing pairs/snap."
9313,2843,5," More cards for an already great LCG."
9314,2844,5," Great and just what I wanted."
9315,2845,5," Bought this via the Kickstarter - Fantastic.  This is my first card game of this type and love that it is self contained so no need to buy add ons.Me and my 10 year old love it."
9316,2846,5," On the warm up to my Christmas poker games I decided to improve my shuffling skills& so I dug up a few decks of nice cards and decided to go for it. The cards I was using were casino grade card& one pack cost around about 5GBP per pack and the other was around 8GBP. Both packs had been used for some games& but were still in pristine condition. In the space of a week I had wrecked the cheaper set with the more expensive set fairing better& but the edges were starting to separate. Both sets were permanently bent in the middle. Admittedly& I was making some mistakes and clashing edges against each other and roughly handling them as I bent them for a shuffle. I decided that I needed to invest in a more robust set of cards.I was reluctant to buy these due to the hefty 22 GBP price tag& thinking I could buy 4-5 sets for the same price& but I threw caution to the wind and I am glad I did. I have really put these cards through their pace. Bending half packs to almost 90 degrees as I shuffle them and after almost 2 weeks of 10 min per night shuffling they still look like new with almost no evidence of permanent bending.Whilst my shuffling had improved through the use of the paper based cards I was still making mistakes and clashing these together& but as they are one piece plastic/cellulose there are no edges to peel apart. They are a bit easier to bend and this reduces hand strain when constantly shuffling. The cards slide smoothly across each other which makes a big difference when bending them to go in for a shuffle - the paper based cards were starting to grind. The cards smooth surface allows the cards to space evenly and so as your thumb slides across the edge to release the card it is done fluidly and much more evenly.Read more â€º"
9317,2846,5," Kem plastic playing cards are worth paying the extra for as the are extremely hardwaring.  We have been playing with another set for over 2 years up to 4 times a week and they still are as good as new.  I bought these not as a replacement but as a second set to keep at a different location."
9318,2846,4," Really nice feel to these cards& very good quality& bit expensive& but hey& you gets what you pay for& right?"
9319,2846,5," Having played a game or two with the cards now& they more than meet my expectations. These cards are quality and well worth it& if you are willing to pay for them."
9320,2846,5," Having read the reviews one thing is not mentioned. Many years ago I was in the Merchant Navy and we used to play Bridge with my Kem cards& After a year of use& about 280 days playing Bridge in the evenings they got a bit dirty so I washed them and they came up like new. They are worth every penny."
9321,2846,4," These are just fine enough to play with. Not a great touching feel. Both colours/pattern look good and as you see it they are wide. But for the price I think they are a good buy!"
9322,2846,4," Cards are fantastic to play with& looking forward to many poker games with them. Only thing is the postage took almost three weeks to arrive"
9323,2846,5," Great cards that are genuinely indestructible"
9324,2847,4," thanks"
9325,2848,5," Arrived very quickly and very happy the cards"
9326,2849,4," This expansion adds 3 more teams and a couple of nice twists. Downed skills& enchanted ball (which can add skills or just end of turn star power) and regeneration (which is a downed skill)The original teams still have just as much chance to win and it all seems to be as well balanced as before. The Vampires can gain star power whenever they injure a player& because of this they can become targets so tend not to get to powerful.Overall& if you have the money spare& it does add a good element to the game."
9327,2849,5," This is the expansion for the base game blood bowl team manager.It is brilliant and if you have the base game then this is a must.3 new teams introducing the shuffling undead& the vampires and dark elves.Also there are some extras which enhance the game play experience."
9328,2849,5," It helps that I LOVE Team Manager obviously but I really enjoy the expansion too. The 3 factions are great fun to play (my favourite is the Undead) and the new elements seem well balanced. Hoping they bring out more expansions soon if this is the standard they'll all reach!"
9329,2849,5," What a brilliant expansion. three new teams (my favs the awesome Undead) plus brilliant new ways to play with Contract awards and magic balls that confer extra skills and fans as well as star player points. Sudden Death rocks."
9330,2849,4," a bit on the expensive side for what you get but as always great quality and a real addition to the games scope"
9331,2850,5," Excellent"
9332,2851,5," This has become my favourite two player game. There are some cool game play mechanics going on here that are hard to explain but really make the difference. Each player chooses a board which represents their Cruiser ship. It has 20 HP and you have to destroy the other person's to win. On the board are five columns of varying heights. You will play you cards& representing ships and powers from the bottom to the top of each column (you cannot play a ship to level 3 (top level) if you don't have ships at levels 0&1&"
9333,2852,3," Q"
9334,2852,5," just wished they sent the tin I tried to ask for. Nev mind does the trick and the xyz monster rocks"
9335,2852,5," Very happy with the item was as described and very fast delivery A1 seller"
9336,2852,5," Great product my 8 year old son loved them. We received them very quickly."
9337,2852,4," Good promos in the tin & maybe try to get it at a cheaper price like I did"
9338,2853,5," Great two decks of plastic coated playing cards that are very different from the usual decks. All the cards are custom including the pips! Great conversation piece.Not to |Bicycle| or |Bee| standards but a close contender in a collectors class all of their own."
9339,2854,5," Would use again"
9340,2855,5," I was a big fan of Game of Thrones Living Card Game (LCG) 1.0 and was heavily invested in that game. In all honesty though 1st edition had run its course with it extensive card catalogue& which made it difficult for new players& and broken game mechanics the game needed a complete re-boot. At first I was gutted that I would have to re-buy all the cards and start again as none of the 1st edition cards can be used in 2nd edition& but after seeing the new cards in 2nd edition I can see it's totally worth it! Of all the LCGs available Game of Thrones has always been my favourite.The designers have done a fantastic job tightening up the mechanics of the game and making it simpler. Be under no illusion& this is a complicated game to play when you take into account all the rules and then each cards abilities& where those abilities fit within the turn structure etc. However& compared to 1st edition& this is now much more thought out. There is now a lot more focus on challenges& challenge based effects and playing the game rather than a card having super abilities that completely cripple an opponents decks ability to make challenges in the game!I love the whole Game of Thrones lore and this game allows you to immerse yourself in eight different factions of the series. There are more characters than from just the TV series but you don't have to have read the books to appreciate the game. The factions included are Stark& Lannister& Baratheon& Targaryen& Greyjoy& Martell and new to second edition Tyrell and Nights Watch.One of the biggest appeals for this game is deck building. Straight out of the core box you can make decks& most by allying two factions together to give you enough cards in a deck (e.g.Read more â€º"
9341,2855,5," If you like Game of thrones and you like card games (of the more modern type such as MTG or NR) then this is a no brainer. I'd have to actually put this above netrunner as the best card game I've ever played. The mechanics are strong& fun and tactical and the way the card powers thematically work with the source material is astounding."
9342,2855,5," First game of this type I've brought for any fans of the show &books and/or world its a must. All though the rules are a bit complicated for first timers I would say keep playing you soon pick it up... I've even got my grandparents involved and they love it...hopes this helps"
9343,2855,5," It's a bit complicated to start but once you get the hang of it it's a lot of fun& love this game."
9344,2856,5," Bought these for my boyfriend as he is a big Iron Man fan.The pictures are clear and there is a lot of different images from comic book covers to just Iron Man portraits."
9345,2857,5," The product is good value for money as it comes with 90 cards in 15 different boosters. The product compliments the starter deck as it almost guarantees at least some of your favourite members& for example I got 3 super rare's and I think around 20 rare's.I conclusion I would highly recommend this to any AKB fan as it is fun and interesting to see the band in this concept."
9346,2857,5," Good quality cards and unlike most other card game booster boxes you actually get 90 Different cards.Only downside for collectors is that you only get three super rare cards per box (1 in 5 packs).If you want to try the game& English instructions can be found online& the Japanese instructions are in the fixed deck starter."
9347,2858,4," This is a great game for the younger person. Easy to understand and win. Graphics are great. Fun game."
9348,2859,5," I bought this for my grand daughter to put her pokemon cards in.  She is 5years old and it was easy for her to store her cards in and because sheets are not top loading there is no possibility of them falling out.  If you have a really big collection you would have to use several books& or the loose sleeves.  This is definitely good for kids."
9349,2859,5," I use this to display my ATC's.  In fact now have several colours.  They are just perfect for this purpose"
9350,2859,5," fab item. I bought this to save my sons PECS visuals in& and its been great. I can store loads in here& and see them all at a glance. Superb& and the folder it good quality so Im confident it will last."
9351,2859,5," Really good binder for my kids card collections. He uses it for several& and takes it to school often in his rough sack. It has taken a lot of abuse and still looks great."
9352,2859,5," An excellent high quality binder for your card collections. Cards fit securely in the binder and it looks great! Will definitely buy some more for the rest of my cards."
9353,2859,4," Nice sturdy binder& the elastic strap on mine snapped and broke quite quickly however. Still& it's done a good job of keeping all my cards safe regardless."
9354,2860,5," my godson says its the best present he got at Crimbo! its got lots of facts about The Reds so he's finding it really interesting and educational."
9355,2860,3," As expected&  arrived quickly . Shame that the cards don't give dates of the players and they are not ranked like the world soccer stars pack."
9356,2860,5," Great product and happy to purchase again. Highly recommended and worthwhile investing on this one if this is what your searching for."
9357,2860,5," My 8 year old loves LFC and top trumps so this was a winner! Great for holidays& long car journeys and a quick game before bed!!"
9358,2860,5," My son loved these cards& they are reasonably priced. They arrived promptly and the packaging was good. No issues to talk of."
9359,2860,5," Great bargain& has most of the famous players included for a third of the price elsewhere. Grandson well pleased!"
9360,2860,5," Not opened as bought as a gift& but as normal trump packs looks good and will have upto date info on team"
9361,2860,5," My grandson will love these. Part of his presents and a nice wrap up. Good present for a liverpool fan."
9362,2861,5," coooool!!! I am a10 year old boy (been doing magic for 6 years now)bought this with my pocket money it is epic on 2nd thoughts wouldn't buy if new/do not know magic like I said I've been doing magic for 6 years now"
9363,2862,5," I have been using cards for years now& only recently having given up my hobby for card magic.people look at bicycle cards as their first choice in most cases of card magic"
9364,2863,5," Seven foot of antique black book case at 3.5 foot high needs something to embellish without looking like clutter. Any larger and it would hang off the shelf.Have a different onyx chess set for actual use. But I needed something that was not plastic for the look. I was about to use museum putty to keep the cats from knocking over the pieces but they have felt on the bottom and I did not want to defelt them.There is a picture of the game in play in the cover of the box so the set is set to look like that instead of starting position.The grid being frosted and clear looks good on an antique black surface."
9365,2864,5," Looks really good ... Finish of the individual pieces very nice. I wanted it for a Christmas present and it fits the bill very nicely."
9366,2864,5," Great gift& well made and beautiful. Have it to a 5year old as his first chess set. His comment was: |Best game in the house!|"
9367,2864,5," Lovely set for the price. Good quality. Bought as present but would like one myself."
9368,2864,2," Very cheap looking& fell apart vert quickly"
9369,2864,5," Beautiful chess board and pieces."
9370,2865,5," This is a beautifully crafted little chess set.  Both the case and the pieces are well made.  Being magnetic& the pieces adhere to the board very securely& though not so much so that you are particularly aware of it when making a move.  The set is the right size for travelling& but also big enough to have a good game on a table top.  I am extremely pleased with this purchase and have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone wanting a good quality chess set that can be used both when travelling and when at home.  Fully deserving of five stars."
9371,2866,5," good value and weight"
9372,2866,5," Value for money"
9373,2866,5," Good stuff!"
9374,2867,4," Ok& first off& this is a very nicely crafted chess set based on characters from all 3 LOTR films. It is well made& beautifully decorated"
9375,2867,5," This chess set is amazing.  Before opening the package I was already impressed with the weight& I thought for the price it was going to be a basic/possibly flimsy set but I was wrong.  The characters are well made and it is of a quality that will last for a long time if taken care of.The good/bad characters actually make the game of chess seem more interesting and fun (obviously if you are a lotr fan) and it is great taking turns which 'side' you are on!I think this is a must for any lotr fan (any age from 6-8 upwards) and is great value for money."
9376,2867,4," This chess set is fantastic and I cant stop looking at it. I fortunately got it at the bargain price of Â£20 off a women doing a house clear out. I came on here to check its value and I think the Amazon price tag is way off what it should be& what I mean by that is yes this is a great set but I wouldn't say its worth over Â£300& the pieces are not made of any great material or crafted with wood and the board is like a monopoly board game style of card& not a wooden board you'd expect with a Â£350 purchase..If you manage to get this for under Â£100 you will be pleased with this set& the figures are great and the presentation of the set is classy despite being made pretty cheaply.The only other negative thing I can add is some of the characters should be changed& the inclusion of Grima Wormtongue was disappointing when so many other evil characters were left out& perhaps a Balrog would of suited more.I would of changed a few others also and maybe added a few more characters that could be used as spares or replacements if the player prefers that character.. Inclusion of Elrond would of been cool.."
9377,2867,5," The playing pieces in this set are superbly painted& fantastic attention to tiny details - truly beautiful.You get the full 'fellowship nine' plus a few extras"
9378,2867,3," Over-priced unfortunately. The detail on the characters is generally good& the board is cardboard and lets it down."
9379,2868,5," Great quality and great price for this kit.This is for our grandson who is just learning and the well made pieces make them easy to identify."
9380,2869,5," excellent price excellent delivery&arrived three days early lovely carved pieces&well made board& for us its perfect looking forward to many hours of strategy.would and have recomended to a friend"
9381,2870,5," Love these - good quality wooden pieces which have individuality of style and are well-made& a good investment for years of enjoyment and comes with a nice looking wooden box."
9382,2871,5," very good all round service-delivery"
9383,2871,5," Perfect"
9384,2872,5," This game is for my 4 year old nephew for Christmas.  I know he already plays it at nursery so I know he is going to love it even more.  Excellent value for money and speedy delivery."
9385,2872,5," Very good"
9386,2873,5," Did not expect this set to be so adorable and small. It basically fits in your hand and is super nifty. Super handy for putting in your luggage or even smallish handbag. Only thing is that the lock on it is hard to open& so currently opening it with a coin. Might be just cos its new."
9387,2873,5," This was a leaving gift for one of our colleague and he loves it. It is compact and is perfect for travelling as described. Would definitely recommend it for all the Chess lovers out there."
9388,2873,3," Slightly smaller than expected but ok"
9389,2873,5," great item"
9390,2874,5," This is a fantastic chess game for those new to chess. My seven year old brought one home from school and I have now ordered one for her as it is brilliant. The pieces are named and the moves are on the pieces."
9391,2874,5," I bought this set for my grandson who is 7 and this is an excellent product for him starting to play chess. With all the moves marked on the pieces helps him to remember what goes where ........excellent purchase."
9392,2874,5," Our four year old loved the set as soon as he came home to see it set up. He has demanded at least a game a day ever since. A previous reviewer stated that the knight was facing the wrong way& but actually& when set up correctly& you read the moves on the opposite players pieces& which allows the beginner to learn to anticipate their opponents moves with ease."
9393,2874,5," I bought this for my 5.5 year old son to learn to play chess with.  He has picked the game up easily thanks to the writing and diagrams on each piece.  It is a great set for beginners& the pieces are chunky for little hands and the diagrams give young children visual clues as to how each piece can move.  I highly recommend it as a first set to teach the game with."
9394,2874,5," My little boy learned to play chess really well and had noone to keep practising with so I ordered this to help me understand the game so I could play with him.  All it means is I now SEE how I am getting beat as does anyone else who plays him LOL. Great idea& items are plastic so nice and light for children to  use."
9395,2874,4," The chess pieces are hollow plastic and larger than you might expect. However& these characteristics are of obvious benefit if there are smaller childfren in the household who put things in their mouth. The plastic pieces are light (and safer for young children)& but seemingly durable as they have proven tantrum-proof when losing! My only criticism is the knight is positioned in the wrong direction& such that the horse faces you when you play the game if you wish the information base of that piece to be visible! Overall& I would recommend the item on its educational value. The lightweight board and pieces carry more safety advantages than disadvantages for the reasons above and are likely to have been designed with such in mind."
9396,2874,3," This arrived quickly& my seven year old is delighted& and wanted it to help him learn chess which I am sure it will do. I was really disappointed in the quality though& chess pieces are cheap plastic& hollow and very lightweight. The board which I thought would be wooden is thick cardboard which folds Into quarters. I think it was over priced seeing as there were other sets listed for around 10 pounds and they were wooden. I feel 13 to 14 pounds is too much for the quality. Saying all this as a learning tool it will be good as the moves etc are on the pieces& so for that it's not a bad buy& just do not expect good quality!"
9397,2874,5," This was bought as a birthday gift for my young grand-daughter& who had asked for this many times.She gets much enjoyment from kt."
9398,2875,5," Excellent detailing& perfect size - portable and aesthetically appealing. Pieces held in place on board by magnets - excellent!"
9399,2876,4," Very good item."
9400,2877,5," I bought this for my five year old nephew who has learned chess at school. As a previous reviewer noted& the pieces are a little light& but all-in-all it's excellent value for money and has been a real success. It looks fairly impressive  and does the job. A great present! (I also included 'Checkmate: My First Chess Book' which is a sound guide and has stylish illustrations!)"
9401,2877,5," My 6 and 5 year old were keen to learn chess and I wanted to get a good-sized and fairly decent wooden set for them without spending loads of money in case they didn't enjoy it. Reasonably priced wooden sets are pretty hard to find. I'm very happy with this one for the price. The pieces are a bit lighter than I would like& too easily knocked over& but they are well shaped and easily distinguishable which is the main important thing for learning. The board itself (other than a completely pointless labelling of rows and columns with letters and numbers) is great. Both board and pieces are a good size for both adults and children& and moving a piece has a good |feel| from the felt base of the pieces on the board. I think the feel of movement is very important to learning and enjoying chess& so if you after a budget set& this one fits the bill very well."
9402,2877,5," Bought as a present for a father who wished to teach his children and wife to play& he said this was exactly what he needed as it looks durable& the pieces are easily recognisable and easy to handle"
9403,2877,4," We bought this for our 6 yr old who is just starting to learn how to play chess.  It's great value for a child who may or may not decide he wants to continue to play chess."
9404,2877,5," The goods arrived well packaged and before anticipated delivery date.  The wooden chess board is robust& the chess pieces seem of good quality and are a good size for both children and adults alike.  The product is competitively priced and I would recommend this product and supplier to anyone - excellent value"
9405,2877,5," This is a very cheap and simple but& all things considered& very satisfactory chess set."
9406,2877,4," Pieces are well shaped and made from fine grained wood& look and feel a lot better than I'd expect from a set this price. Board is perfectly serviceable if nothing special."
9407,2877,5," Brought this for 6 yr old grandson really enjoys the board and pieces being of good standard and also the grid laid out on the sides. Works well along side chess on the internet."
9408,2878,5," Good Quality& numbers nice and bright& very happy with the purchase"
9409,2879,4," I was looking for a bingo style children's game because my daughter loves the bingo games that sometimes come up in children's magazines.  She is a big Shopkins fan to so I thought this seemed ideal.  It is a good game and she is very pleased with it.  It's not quite the same as bingo because you roll the dice on your turn and check your own card.  I think it would be better if you take it in turn to roll the dice& but also call out the result for all players to check& more like bingo.  You can always do this if you want though.  It is OK with 2 players& but the more players the better and you can have six!  It would take ages with six unless you bend the rules and get everyone to check their card for each dice roll.To add interest& there are some differences to purely just bingo.  The dice decide a character and column& and you can end up with two of the same character in a column so you can choose which to tick off (with a tiddlywink counter). Also if you roll a shopping trolley and a character you can tick off that character anywhere you choose on the board which adds to the fun and provides room for some very basic tactics and decision making.The dice are big (hence the name of the game)& I'd say two to three times normal size& and quite heavy solid plastic (protect your dining table!). No actual Shopkins come with this game unlike the Shopkins supermarket scramble game (which is perhaps more fun than this one).Good game. One very pleased Shopkins fan!"
9410,2879,5," My daughters absolutely love this game. They are both Shopkins mad and have had ours of fun playing this game. Great product& would definitely recommend!!/!"
9411,2879,5," Good game but expensive for what it is! Kids will love it!!"
9412,2879,5," It's for Xmas and I know my daughter going to love this x"
9413,2880,5," Super chess set really happy with it"
9414,2880,5," Very nice and good quality"
9415,2881,5," Fantastic quality item. Perfect for my 9 year old son to practise for his chess tournaments without having to worry about damaging it. Low priced& good quality and serves its purpose perfectly."
9416,2881,5," A very adequate set for beginners to play with& good quality with a guide inside as to how to use."
9417,2881,5," Brought to teach my sister Chess& so the price& simple looking pieces and it being black and white was all she needed. She couldn't get the hang of my themed sets."
9418,2881,5," Excellent first set bought for my 6 year old granddaughter.  Good value& good looking.  Everyone was pleased especially me.  Thanks."
9419,2881,5," Just a good cheap chess set& bought 1 each for me"
9420,2881,5," Very good buy& well happy with chess set& cheap and cheerful&well done& can't ask for anymore&be back again for more."
9421,2881,5," Really good value. The children at our school chess club very pleased. I'm going to order another six sets. Thank you"
9422,2881,5," Good quality for the price! Much better than expected& not just low end plastic product& but made with good cares."
9423,2882,3," It's a good set& pieces are nice. Takes a while to get used to the characters as the normal chess pieces.The board isn't as fun as the pieces themselves. The pieces are a a little plastic-y& at first they look metal and they are dense& but they are plastic none the less. Some pieces with thin arms were a little bent& but no problem to gentle push back into shape. The bending was probably due to the internal tight packaging and perhaps postage.Overall its a good set with a fun theme& good for children about 7+ I would say. Excellent as a joke present for someone getting into / re-starting chess and loves the Simpsons"
9424,2882,4," Very surprised with the excellent quality of this set& although the box was a little battered.  My nephew will love this& can't wait to give it to him for Christmas."
9425,2882,5," Great game and nice quality"
9426,2883,4," One of the better game compendiums& I'[ve come across& the board and pieces are closer to a travel set than the full size& versions: however& my 7 year old daughter has had no problem with the size of the pieces.What's good:* It comes with small cloth bags for storing the pieces& which reduces the likelihood of their being lost.* It's big enough to be able to play each game& but not so big that storage is a problem.* For the quality& it's a great price.What could be better:* The finish is just a tad rough on the board.If you're looking for a cost-effective way to introduce your children to these games& then this is ideal."
9427,2883,1," This chess/draughts/backgammon set is a real disappointment. It arrived very poorly packaged. The box itself was covered in a thick layer of dust/dried up mud and was damaged.The actual board is bowed and so swivels about on a table. Very poorly made. It looks cheap and I certainly wouldn`t recommend it. I bought it with the intention to give it to my Mum as a present but by no stretch of imagination can this be a present and not offend. Don`t buy."
9428,2883,2," I was so disappointed when this arrived.  The board was obviously MDF with a very thin veneer of wood top and bottom.  The veneer was slightly split on one side of the board and the hinges looked as if they were starting to rust.  Certainly not the quality item I had hoped for. I packaged up immediately ready for return."
9429,2883,5," Smaller than I expected but suitable and very well made. I was concerned that the centre of each hinge would protrude and create a rocking motion when playing but I can happily report that this was not the case. I am very happy with my purchase and we have had many games on this board already.I think that this is well worth the money and would make a lovely birthday or Christmas for any child of any age. It is light and practical enough in size that you could easily pack this to go on holiday and keep the family entertained - even with airlines diminishing luggage allowances!"
9430,2883,5," I love this reasonable wooden Chess/ Draughts/ Backgammon board. I'm espacially fond of the fluffy bags that hold the pieces. The kids love it too. Comes in a sturdy carboard box that's Ok for storage until something better can be found. It also makes me inordinately pleased to see my kids play chess -  which generally is beyond my concentration and attention span - and gives me hope in for the next generation!!"
9431,2883,5," Ideal for taking on holiday. Pieces are small but the board is a decent size. Good quality with simple instructions."
9432,2883,3," Much& much smaller than imagined. I wouldn't say the pieces are big enough for a proper game."
9433,2883,2," Pieces are smaller that expected& but that's my fault for not visualizing what a board of this size would be like& and what size pieces it would accommodate.  The main reason for the low rating is that the brass hinge protrudes from the board when you use the backgammon board& and this would scratch any surface you use the board on when playing backgammon."
9434,2884,4," My son got it for his birthday a couple of months ago and he's been playing with it since so the toy was a great success. The figures are excellent quality and look simply lovely. However& one complaint I have is that the set is very expensive in my opinion so I would expect Plastoy to show a bit more imagination and make the board out of something more durable. It is just cardboard& not resilient - especially in the hands of a child - and you can't fold it. Plus& the box is soft and not intended for storing the figures in it& so you need to have a place for the whole collection and the board& otherwise it'll be lying around and getting damaged."
9435,2884,4," all the smurf chess set character are very good in design and quality& but he chess board could have been better in terms of quality and material"
9436,2884,4," I like the wooden pieces& which are bright and appealing for a child& but I don't think the quality of the board or the box reflects the high price. It comes in a package& not a proper box with a lid for storage. Also there were no rules included. Admittedly chess is a complex game& but surely the basics could have been included. I think it is over-priced& and would have rated it lower except that my grandson really loves it."
9437,2884,4," The pieces are very nice and look durable. The chessboard could have been better (it's hard carton& foldable in two but in the hands of children it will surely not last. I would prefer one of better material and one you could store by rolling.) All in all& it is a very nice chess set that kids will love and enjoy!!"
9438,2885,5," The chess board is very well made. Delivery very prompt. Be carefull to match the board size with the chess pieces you have or are purchasing."
9439,2886,5," Yeah it does the job for me& well made."
9440,2887,5," im a massive Buffy fan and collector and only found this chess set about 2 years ago. i mainly brought it as part of my collection but played it once and it was hard. to me its more of a collectible piece.the playing pieces are characters from the show. buffy& angel&xander&willow &giles&oz&the judge&spike&drusilla&the master& darla and Ethan rayne. there is only one buffy and one angel as they are the king and queen.the paint work on the pieces isn't great and looks rushed.it really is a must have piece for any buffy fan."
9441,2888,5," So much fun! Easy to learn. The kubb was like a miniature version of what I'm used to but that only means that its easier to carry to the park!The bag that came with it was really nice and practical too! All in all a really good deal :)Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreat."
9442,2888,5," Once you get the hang of the rules this is a great game. can scale the pitch to make it easier or more difficult to play. would recommend."
9443,2889,5," Everything is ok!! Nice experience"
9444,2889,5," Fast delivery"
9445,2890,5,""
9446,2890,4," Before I bought this set& my biggest concern was the spinning motion of the wheel itself (which is actually very good). This brief video is intended to help others who may have the same concern. Please excuse the superfluous background comments from my dad."
9447,2890,4," Bought this for my kids and they really have fun with it. It is bigger than I thought it would bebut I think that is a plus point however it is very noisy!"
9448,2890,5," Service and delivery very good Within a couple of days we had relations round and although initialy there was no interest within 15 minutes everyone was hooked great fun without the danger of losing real money great value and fun."
9449,2890,5," Roulette and Blackjack set.Excellent choice& had hours of fun with this. Would recommend this for a family get together."
9450,2890,5," great way for adults to have fun and for older kids a great way of learning how to add and multiply"
9451,2890,5," I bought this for my husband and he was really chuffed with it and we have used it for casino nights and its great."
9452,2890,4," great kids love it and its good all round family entertainment! my sons numbers are much better now as well !"
9453,2891,5," Bought this for my Grandaughter&it's really beautiful."
9454,2892,5," Very good item."
9455,2893,4," Worthy of 5 stars& but all magnets didn't stick to the pieces& so the |only| 4 stars is because I had to find the glue."
9456,2894,5," i car`nt believe it  came so fast the supplier gets 100%as for the chess set & it was brilliantly packed and the set is worth every peny&it's pieces are as you should expect && supperblie made and the board is brilliant &need i say more ... thanks ..."
9457,2894,5," Absolutely outstanding. I wanted this chess peice as both a collectors item and as a display peice. It serves both those roles perfectly. The quality and details of both the figures and the board capture the epic appeal of The Lord of the rings superbly. For anyone lord of the rings fan& or chess set collector& this is a total must have"
9458,2895,3," Disappointing that the pieces are chrome plated plastic rather than metal."
9459,2895,1," This is cheap cheap cheap in every way. Not remotely worth the money....horrified this was ever on sale at Â£39.99!The contents are described as 'silver chrome pieces and gun metal pieces'. They are in fact made of the lightest of cheap plastic and silver/gun metal COLOURED. Though& to be frank& it's very difficult to tell the difference which makes playing the game very hard.A thoughtful Christmas present from a family member& knowing what big Thunderbirds fans we are& but VERY disappointing and a total rip-off."
9460,2895,5," Great surprise present for my husband& loads of memories"
9461,2896,5," This mat was purchased for use with GURPS role playing. In the past& we have been using sheets of paper printed and taped together& but it was never a good solution.This mat is writable& cleanable& doesn't have strange seams when properly rolled and in overall good quality. I will although recommend try to cover the play table with sheets of paper to measure the the size before purchase. 120 cm x 85 cm doesn't sound like much& but it really is a _lot_ of space."
9462,2896,4," This is a fairly large grid consisting of hexagonal and square grids and uses a aged effect. It's dry wipe so you can use board  pens on it and erase with a damped cloth if needed. It's basically made out of linoleum (the same stuff that flooring is basically made of) So it's pretty expensive for what the product actually is considering I recently bought a much bigger white board for an additional Â£5. However I would still recommended the mat for its portability."
9463,2896,5," Been an avid roleplayer for 15 years and this is only the second megamat I have bought. They just last so darn long! Came with a nice pen too. Amazing!"
9464,2896,5," Good construction and works really well.  Lays nice and flat.  Arrived in a timely manner."
9465,2897,1," This Chess set is definitely overpriced. It is very cheaply made. The first set i ordered came with the corner of the board broke. When i phoned the suppliers& filmandtvstuff& they suggested i glue it& for Â£300.00& i don't think so!! The next set they sent& the felt on bottoms of chess pieces were coming off. So i wanted to return this set too& after much arguing with filmandtvstuff& they reluctantly paid for the return. I would never ever use this seller again as they are not nice people to deal with."
9466,2897,4," Chess set was great but missing the advertised certificate of authenticity which we will now have to chase up ourselves"
9467,2897,5," my partner is amazed at the detail on each piece and over the moon with his christmas present well worth the money good quality and looks fabulous when on display"
9468,2897,5," the item is better than expected"
9469,2898,4," Was slightly sdissappointed wehen it arrived& smaller than expected and not quite as attractive as it appeared. Having said that my 11 year old Grandson was VERY pleased with it saying he thought it better than the picture ( although he did think it looked smaller) So it looks like it depends on taste! Overall it is well made and I am pleased with this purchase. Delivery etc very good"
9470,2898,4," This product looks great and seems to be very durable.  It is brilliant that everything stores away within the board& making it easy to store.  My husband loved it for his Christmas present."
9471,2898,5," The product is ok& it contains everything and its like in the picture. I quite like the board& very nice"
9472,2898,5," good quality"
9473,2899,4," This is a pretty good structure deck and comes with 40 cards ready to duel. there are some pretty good cards in here and they are all set up to work well together. after a few duels' you learn to take advantage of all the effects and spells to keep recycling monsters and get out Machina Fortess ( the main card of the deck  as the whole deck focuses on draining the enemies life with this card ) and to keep him in play. union monsters combined with Machina Fortress give it a lot of survivability. Although there are other high level monsters in this pack it is best not to use them but simply to discard them to take advantage of Machina Fortress's special summon& | discard any number of machine type monsters whose total levels equal 8 or more to special summon this card from the grave or your hand|. Add scrap recycler to the mix and you can summon 2 lvl 4 monsters from your grave every turn meaning it is relatively easy to keep Fortress in play. all of this mixed with some pretty decent trap cards and releasable spell cards makes for a decent deck at the asking price. i myself have bough t 2 and combined to take advantage of the Machine card synergy and to replace some of the weaker cards with repeats.all in all a decent deck worth a look at."
9474,2899,4," To be honest& i grew up when Yu-Gi-Oh was the thing. A few years on& and now it's coming back into fashion& i decided to (after losing a few games with my old cards) upgrade. I did buy it elsewhere& but it'd the same product. When purchasing i was hoping it would be Warriors Strike& but in fact was a random deck& which turned out to be Machina Mayhem. A bit dissapointed at first& i opened the pack on the way back home.I was surprised to find it is actually a decent pack. Despite all my previous decks& this is now my favourite as it has many different cards that play different roles for different strategies. You can use the Gadets to summon multiple cards in your hand. Or you could use the power-route to use Machina cards to summon Machina Force - 4600 ATK 4100 DEF& easily the most powerful card in a duel. Multiple trap and spell cards will get you destroyed machines a purpose such as union monsters being resummoned or recycled& a very useful feature in a long duel. And the real star is the fact monsters can so easily be powered up by others& giving a leading edge in a straight up duel. Another thing this deck really does is give you power over your own deck"
9475,2899,5," If your looking for a very competitive deck& then look no further. This deck is all about the front cover monster machina fortress. There are several strategies to bring him to the field& even at the very begining of the duel. This is all down to his ability of being able to be special summoned from your hand or graveyard by sending machines equal to level 8 from hand to grave. then you could summon a union monster and attach it the fortress giving it alot of durability on the field. And if you run out if monsters to discard to summon fortress then scrap recycler will be able to recycle your level 4 machines from your grave for you to use again.Highly recommend getting 2-3 to get some important copies. not just the machines but spells like solidarity which gives all your machines an 800 atk boost. And traps like dimensional prison.All around great deck which is very diverse and easily customizable. There is also i belive an ancient gear structure deck out there. Not tried it myself but i suppose you could combine the two somehow might an be interesting combination"
9476,2900,5," Product as described. Good support too :)"
9477,2901,5," I received one of these as a christmas present from a friend. Since then I have bought myself another three. Each box holds about 2000 cards& maybe more. The box comes with 6 card divides& and a sheet of labels. I divide my cards up according to colour& and type. So even with 4 boxes I have had to make extra divides. Each box also comes with a list of labels& but you only get one label for enchantments& sorceries& artifacts ect ect& per sheet/per box& but there are blank labels you can add your own text on.Considering the price of booster packs these days& and the fact that this container comes with 4& this product is extremely good value for money (Or that was true when I bought the product January 2015) as the price of the container is less than the price of 5 booster packs.If you're looking for good storage& that is also value for money. This is it."
9478,2901,4," Box isn't great quality. The lid doesn't fit very well and the cardboard inside is flimsy and not attached great but over all it does make a nice storage box. The plastic dividers are nice however i would have liked more as 6 is not enough really.The rest of the contents are great though with 4 booster packs and a special promo card. I would only buy it at a cheap price though as its not worth more than about Â£12."
9479,2901,3," I have to say the quality of these gift boxes especially compared to previous ones is shocking and I am very disappointed as Wizards are usually better than this."
9480,2901,2," The product was good& except I only got three of the four booster packs! Cant get a refund because I have already opened the other three and cannot remember which ones I got."
9481,2901,4," Not as well made as the previous years& but still a decent storage box and good choice of gift for any magic player"
9482,2902,4," Fantastic product. As a person who had never really played MTG before buying this it provided me with enough cards to happily make a playable deck of any colour& and I would totally recommend this product for any player novice or otherwise& and fully intend to buy the 2015 edition when it comes out next year. the only thing preventing me from giving it a full 5 stars are two complaints& one terribly minor& one sort of major.The minor one: The box I got was very much skewed towards green and black& with blue coming off the worst and it would be nice to have had more of a balance. I must stress that I still have plenty of blue cards and cards of other colours& but I certainly have more green and black than any other colour. I've very recently bought a friend the box as a gift and I've yet to find out if this is a common experience or just an anomaly.The slightly more major one: The rules cards that come in the box are very vague and myself and my flatmate played a few games with a very skewed view on how some of the more specific rules work and needed the help of a veteran friend to set us straight. I know that I could have checked the rules online& but we were completely unaware of the rules that we were taking in the wrong way.To reiterate I completely think this is a fantastic& if not very very very slightly flawed package& and the fact that I bought another one for a friend should stand testament to my support for the product.You dig magic: The Gathering& or want to get into it? This is a product for you."
9483,2902,5," This is truly the best way to start a new card game I have came across so far. Up until now I have been an avid Yu Gi Oh player and they do not offer anything like this pack. The vast array of card gives you plenty of room for personalising and there is a very helpful sheet telling you how to set up a deck. If you find that your deck doesn't suit what you are trying to achieve then you can simple use some of the other card& of which there are many. This is a fantastic product and I am glad I bought it."
9484,2902,5," This is a fantastic starting point for casual players who want to have a go at creating their own decks. Your appreciation of this product vs the various other Magic products out there though is going to vary depending on whether or not you're an existing player or a beginner& and whether you are interested in the deck building side of the game as well as the actual playing.To clarify the 'semi-random' aspect of this kit& you get 100 basic lands (20 of each colour)& 85 fixed cards (evenly spread across the 5 colours)& and then 4 sets of 10 cards randomly selected from 11 possibles sets& plus 4 booster packs (all containing 11 commons& 3 uncommons& 1 rare& one basic land and one marketing card which may have a creature token on one side of it if the pack contained a card which generates tokens). Depending on your luck you can end up with some pretty interesting cards from the booster packs& I ended up getting quite a few dual colour gold cards in mine on top of a couple from the semi-random cards& which fed perfectly into my choice of deck coloursFrom what I can gather& although the set does include 5 rare cards exclusive to the set& the other cards in the deck are probably not going to set the world on fire for an experienced player who already has lots of cards in their collection& it is definitely meant as a starter kit rather than one to bolster an established collection.Read more â€º"
9485,2902,5," I purchased this box set as something for my children and I to play as an alternative to video games all the time. I had played Magic as a teen in the 90s but never really got going with it.Anyway& this product is a great starting point for players such as myself who want to get into the game and is not prepared to start playing competitively.I've heard some unfair criticisms of this set as it is not full of powerful card. However that isn't really the point of purchasing this set. It's biggest strength is giving a new player a starting point to try a variety of decks. Do you prefer to play the aggressive red colour or the more tactical blue? This box has enough of everything for you to try them all and settle on a play style before you go out and buy some competitive cards.So if you are considering starting out at Magic and have not got a collection then this is a great starting point. More seasoned players may be frustrated at the lack of high power cards but& really& this is not the product for them."
9486,2902,5," As someone that was totally knew to MAgic the gathering& and had little to no understanding of it prior to purchase i'm very pleased with this& and have since bought my partner the 2014 one. It comes with everything you need to get started building decks and just trying out Magic. As we were both new we started by just player red vs white& black vs blue ect until we understood the game and colours better& and then we made our decks. We made them a bit too big (100+) and then gradually cut the dead weight. For anyone totll new this was an easy way to gradually get into the game& also the box works well to keep any future cards you add to your colletion as theres plenty space& even when sleeved."
9487,2903,5," When I first bought this figure& I was absolutely amazed at it's size. This figure's wingspan means that it literally takes over the shelf! It also makes sound effects if you press the 'button' on it's upper torso. Any Yu-Gi-Oh fan or figure collector would love this product!"
9488,2904,5," Excellent"
9489,2905,5," top class"
9490,2906,4," Bought for young child who collects skylanders card. Does what it's supposed to. Space for all cards and comes with poster and limited edition card. Only negative was price. Found same product cheaper in supermarket after ordering this one."
9491,2906,5," Like all Topps starter packs you get a binder& a booster pack& a unique promotional card& a few mini games and a poster where you can tick off the cards you have in your collection.This unopened product is well worth the money for collectors and& if possible& I would recommend buying the collectors tin as well."
9492,2906,5," My Daughter is skylander mad since getting the game for christmas and course they have to collect the cards too! So we had cards everywhere so this is perfect for keeping them all neat and tidy& you get a bonus pack of cards too with a very limited edition card you can't get anywhere else so Daughter was very happy !!!!!"
9493,2906,5," Excellent combination &cards&figures chart . We were every impress with the product we have found on Amazon &my 7years is a big fan of Skylanders&this binder was a great present for him to keep all his cards in the same places."
9494,2906,5," Binder was great and much appreciated by the recipient who could not wait to start |trading| with the enclosed cards.Delivery was prompt and received in good order.Excellent present for 7 year old"
9495,2906,4," My 6 year old son loved it& great for storing all those cards he has been collecting& and he liked the extra limited edition card you get in this ack. Quick delivery too."
9496,2906,5," My son was really pleased with this as he mainly wanted the album& but he thought the skylanders stuff was great too. Brilliant that it arrived so quickly."
9497,2906,2," Did not contain cards and cellophane was ripped. Arrived quickly and appeared well wrapped however disappointed overall with quality of purchase"
9498,2907,5," Very Good fitting card sleeves when used for |double-sleeving| Cardfight Vanguard and Yu-Gi-Oh! cards& ultra pro 60 small sized sleeves fit perfectly inside of these clear standard size sleeves."
9499,2907,5," I purchased these card protectors to use for marking my Warmachine cards and they do not disappoint. An absolutely perfect snug fit for the cards and plenty of sleeves to use in the future."
9500,2908,5," Arrived quickly well packaged& my son loves the cards being a longstanding Yugioh fan."
9501,2908,5," Great product& as described. Delivered on Prime next day (Sunday!)"
9502,2908,5," Excellent transaction& would use again."
9503,2908,5," Good"
9504,2909,4," firstly the dispatch time was 2 days which is rediculous >.> but the price is well worth 24 packs of 5 ultra and secret rare cards.i bought this box to start getting back into yugioh after 2 years of quiting. and oh boy was i not dissapointed . considering the fact that theres atleast 4 or 5 differant archetypes of decks to collect in this set i was pleasently surprised. some of these include the gem knights & and the gusto cards & which are extremely fun to play btw. dont get me wrong & each card is only worth atleast Â£2.00 & so if your trying to pull rare cards to make your money back then this is not the set for you. this set is more for creating fun and unique decks .i hope you enjoy this box as much as i did ."
9505,2909,4," this is a great buy for anyone wanting to build an evilswarm& vylon& gusto& gishki or gem-knight deck good value for money"
9506,2909,5," An excellent item that arrived on time. Thank you so much :)"
9507,2909,4," yeah good"
9508,2910,4," also didn't pay close enough attention when ordering. the main picture shows four packs& the second picture just one. and of course& it's just one you get (for double what you'd pay in the store).no complaint about the cards in the pack& just the way this item was advertised. other sellers are clearer& even in the description they'd add '(1 pack of 10 cards)' or something along those lines.on the plus side& it's teaching my son about the ups and downs of internet shopping."
9509,2910,2," very poor for what i had to pay for the card & thought i was getting more then on pack & after all i can get them in the shops for 3&25i fill we should had been told it was just i pack for over 6.00 that was not what was on the info the main campany didnot reply to my email &so will not get from them again"
9510,2910,5," I actually thought it was quite funny because the first card I pulled out &from the sapphire booster pack I received& was a Magikarp.The only good card I got in the end was a shiny Pidgey but it is supposed to be random so I wont blame the unlucky set of cards I got on the seller."
9511,2910,5," EXCELLLENT LOVE IT MY SON ADORES POKEMON AND WILL ENJOY RECEIVING THIS ITEM HE AS A STARTING COLLECTION AND WILL LOVE THESE"
9512,2910,5," Great& quick delivery 5 stars."
9513,2911,5," this was great i love it it came very promptly and it was just a  altogether good item. i got some very rare cards in it aswell including 2 of the other dragon rulers.If you don't think the tins for you think twice. it will boost you deck so you have a much much stronger deck and much more.I myself didn't think this tin was going to be good at all but i tried it and it was amazing i had to buy another tin somewhere else. also this is the cheapest tin i found online and they are even more expensive in shops so if you are a big yugioh fan or want to get into something new try this its great."
9514,2912,5," this is a sick tin I got a mega charizard y with this"
9515,2913,5," I asked my son what he wanted for his 10th birthday& expecting the usual 9 year old boy response of |X-box& iPod or new bike| etc etc.To my surprise& my decade old& Harry Potter obsessed little dude simply wanted a Harry Potter bookmark (no& really!)I found these little beauties here on Amazon and bought them after reading the good reviews. Once my order was placed& the estimated delivery date was 10 days away (ie AFTER my son's birthday).  I received them 3 days later... So delivery service was fantastic.My son opened these on his birthday (amongst other pressies!) and he loves them so much he even took them into school to show his Harry Potter obsessed friends and his teachers!They are encased in a lovely display case and do their job well (Gryffindor bookmark currently being used in his Goblet of Fire book).All in all& I would recommend these to a friend and think they are great value."
9516,2913,5," My mum loved this. She is completely obsessed with Harry Potter and these were a good gift for the slightly older fan. Well presented and packaged well."
9517,2913,4," A great gift.  The only thing that I didn't like was that the box seems too plastic."
9518,2913,3," I always wanted a really good set of bookmarks that I would really like. I don't like using paper bookmarks& photos and such so I bought these. When they FINALLY arrived it took me several minutes to actually get to them due to the amount of unnecessary packaging. I was disappointed with the size of them& the pictures make them look much bigger than they actually are. All four can easily fit in the palm of your hand. The casing is nice and can be put to use after you take the bookmarks out. I'm a little confused on how to use the bookmarks as when you put them in your book as is& if you open the book slightly the bookmark falls out which isn't very good. The middle section moves when pushed and you can sort of clip it onto a page& but that makes the page crease and I still have yet to find the correct way to use them& but for now I'll stick to the page creasing method. Other than this I think they are extremely good quality bookmarks& but I think they are too dear for the money. Â£5 per bookmark is a little dear for something so small. I think Â£10 for them would be a much more appropriate price. :}"
9519,2913,5," I brought this as a big reader and huge harry potter fan and was very pleased with my purchase. There are small and very suitable for books and holds in place perfectly in which I never lose my page. There also are very detailed have lovely designs"
9520,2913,5," I love them well presented however not for me b pressie for my husband who will love them I hope as a great bookmark!"
9521,2913,5," Saw these in Hamley's over the Summer. So fortunately Amazon had them and I was able to buy them secretively.My Harry Pottter mad daughter will just love them.They look expensive and the case is great for displaying these bookmarks.They look far more than just bookmarks as all the Hogwarts House emblems are here."
9522,2913,4," An absolutely stunning collection of bookmarks. Very decorative& with the smallest detail clear to see. Definitely worth it for any Harry Potter fan that you might know.The bookmarks themselves weren't as big as I'd hoped& but nonetheless still a lovely set that come in a nice solid display case."
9523,2914,4," This is a great fun set for MTG players that love a game of EDH. It can take a while longer to play so I would reccomend setting aside a full afternoon or evening but this is the best of all the new EDH decks."
9524,2915,5," this arrived the next day as stated& and on opening noticed that inside the tin was also a stack of cards! with a limited edition Elsa card. this made our little girls day. will be buying more of these as the collection grows. great product& great service."
9525,2915,1," Gimic....this is terrible value& an absolute rip off. It only fits approx 30 cards. It's a ton box with a picture of Frozen. Don't get suckered in to buying this as you'll be as disappointed as my daughter was."
9526,2915,2," Ours came with cards and game rules. It was a gift so we thought the whole game should be in the box. Had two disappointed little girls when we found you needed ice AND love cards to play the game and we had all ice cards except one! Are we supposed to buy packs of these now!?!? Disappointing present :("
9527,2915,2," Frozen card collecting tin.  This tin is literally the size of the collection cards& so it's tiny and not what I was expecting. It won't hold very many cards so it's rather a disappointment (for me) and not worth the money& but luckily for my Frozen-mad niece she liked it."
9528,2915,5," Does what it says on the tin! Nice to get extra special cards and my daughter likes having a swaps tin to match her brother's Match Attax one."
9529,2915,4," 6 year old granddaughter& great Frozen fan& loved putting her cards in the tin. Shame it wasn't a bit bigger."
9530,2915,5," Quick delivery and on time&arrived in perfect condition&my granddaughter is so going to love this.lovely."
9531,2915,5," Just as expected& a sturdy little tin for keeping my granddaughters' Frozen cards safe."
9532,2916,5," top class"
9533,2917,4," Currently this is the best purchase for a new Magic player& until the new set arrives in July. Event decks use cards that are legal in |Standard| tournaments and are good enough to use straight from the box (certainly better than the Intro pack decks). It comes with advice on extra cards to buy to upgrade the deck (and there is plenty of advice on the internet too).However& this isn't one of the best event decks that Wizards of the Coast have produced& and fares poorly against the older Born of the Gods event deck for example. So& I deducted one star for that :)I still recommend this as the best first purchase though."
9534,2918,4," Dad bought these for me as I collect XL cards and great selection and good for storing double cards"
9535,2918,5," if you want to have your cards protective you should definitely get this to protect you cards."
9536,2919,4," The deliver was faster than I expected& But the description says you will get 10 cards in a pack and 36 packs but you get 5 cards a pack and 36 cards& cards are good quality and in good condition just get less than advertised."
9537,2919,5," EXCELLENT PRODUCT GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ALL CUSTOMERS WITH A INTEREST IN YU GI OH CARDS"
9538,2919,5," Good value for the amount of cards you get you might get alot of doubles but the rates you get make up for it."
9539,2920,5," Arrived in good time and well packaged. This tin is ample size to store the cards in& keeping them all together instead of over the floor!  Grandson very happy with it."
9540,2920,4," Son loves all things skylanders"
9541,2920,5," Thank you"
9542,2920,5," brill"
9543,2921,5," My son is still loving collecting these& even though no-one else seems to know what they are!"
9544,2922,5," These aren't first edition but nowhere in the listing mentions they are. I got amazing pulls with 4 EX cards and 1 secret EX rare! Extremely happy with my purchase and almost completed the full collection. Will be purchasing the kygore set next :)"
9545,2922,5," Came early& well packaged and I got great cards. 5/5 as far as I'm concerned. The box I recieved was in first edition. Worth the money."
9546,2922,5," My son super excited with the pack and how quickly it came x"
9547,2922,1," The box I received was not first edition"
9548,2923,5," This was a great booster pack with some great spell and trap cards& only 2 monsters were included however one was stardust dragon so i'm still very happy with this pack."
9549,2924,4," I bought this for Yu-Gi-Oh! cards and I find the deck box itself very handy. Its durable and the lid holds itself down well. I didn't use the sleaves as they were too large and clumsy but the cards fits into the box perfectly. I have great peace of mind that the cards are very safe in the box!"
9550,2924,5," The boxes fit plenty of cards inside them while sleeved in the plastic sleeves.The sleeves fit perfectly and I am pleased with how the cards look and feel with them on. It also allows for easy shuffling without damaging the edges of the cards at all because the sleeves slide between one another.If you are looking for a box to hold a deck (could easily fit 90 sleeved cards inside) then this is a good choice. I am pleased with the product and if I need more deck boxes and sleeves& I will get these again.The delivery was on time& and the box was in good condition containing the deck boxes I ordered."
9551,2924,3," Initially I thought this was a great little holder& perfect for my MTG cards and for a week or two it was.  Unfortunately during my travels to and from work the box seems to have cracked along the front and& while this hasn't affected the structure of the box particularly I am slightly worried about how long it will last."
9552,2924,4," Card box designed to hold 120 cards in sleeves& does what it says on the packet. Good product to start with for deck protection."
9553,2924,5," I've had these card boxes 2 days now and can honestly say I'm really happy with my purchase& I've seen a few reviews saying they're not all that great.. Let's get things straight first you get what you pay for if I was spending over Â£5 on a deck box yes I would expect better quality! But these deck boxes are fairly cheap and do what they say on the tin. Fortunately for me& the boxes I've got are fantastic!If you're simply looking for a deck box to match your card sleeves or just a deck box to keep your cards safe I do recommend these if you're on a budget or just not willing to spend a lot of money. I've got so much faith in these I've ordered 3 more for my other decks.I definitely recommend!"
9554,2924,4," The good thing about this was product was that it was in good condition and turned up on time. What I am puzzled by is that there were no card sleeves with the Deck Box even though when ordering this it say's that it comes with 100 free card sleeves. I feel kind of cheated a little bit due to the false advertising. But still& great deck box."
9555,2924,4," Its a deck box plain and simple. There isn't really anything else I can say other than that. Get one if you need one."
9556,2924,3," So I bought this for my Noble Knights deck& and as soon as I opened the box& I realised it was a lot more 'bendy'(?) than my other 5 Ultra Pro deck boxes. Doesn't seem as good quality& but I'm not picky. Just thought I'd point it out for anyone interested (:"
9557,2925,5," I bought these for a present and as Pokemon is popular its what I give them for both birthdays and Christmas&as they always ask for them so it also takes away the stress of guessing what to buy......"
9558,2925,5," It's a fun little thing to have& it bothered me a little that every card was signed but it still works as a trading card so I guess that's alright.It was in perfectly good condition when it arrived and I have no complaints."
9559,2926,5," Awesome"
9560,2927,5," I ordered these for my son and he is having a great time playing with his cousins. A great buy"
9561,2928,5," Brilliant the full set for a very good price and my nephew was over the moon with them trying to get the book filled this time for him. Good delivery."
9562,2928,5," Great item& great packaging"
9563,2928,5," As described good value."
9564,2928,5," Gr8 cards"
9565,2928,5," top class"
9566,2929,5," Excellent"
9567,2930,5," Recipient happy with it."
9568,2930,5," Very quick delivery. my daughter was a very happy little girl&especially when she pulled out Christian benteke! Happy villa fan! Thank you"
9569,2931,4," Item arrived quickly and pleased with them overall.Received 30 gems per bag& so was able to give the other away as I only need 27.I have seen nicer looking ones around& these look a little bland compared to some."
9570,2932,4," Was smaller than I expected& but my son was very happy"
9571,2932,5," Got the product really fast and my child loved it."
9572,2932,5," Great Christmas gift to a 7 yearold"
9573,2932,5," It was very good"
9574,2932,5," Excellent"
9575,2933,5," :)"
9576,2934,4," great if you want a few extra cards.it took less than a week to get here by post"
9577,2935,5," Bargain pack. Legends. Great purchase."
9578,2935,5," top class"
9579,2935,4," My grandson was very pleased - thanks"
9580,2936,5," Son loved it"
9581,2936,5," Excellent"
9582,2937,5," Excellent card boosters"
9583,2937,5," I have been collecting these cards a while now and was not disappointed with these & great cards and great artwork good addition to my collection"
9584,2938,5," Did well as a zero-effort casual deck."
9585,2938,5," My son very happy ðŸ˜Š"
9586,2939,5," Just amazing"
9587,2940,5," Item arrived on time"
9588,2941,5," Who got Cranium for Crimbo? Hands up!!! I did!!! And if like me you thought it got boring when the cards became too familiar then you should buy this! It makes the game a whole load more exciting. A whole load more cards to make your game a ton more interesting& how much bending and rolling can that poor glob of putty take?!?It's really fun& it's extremely durable& and it's educational& seriously!!! No really& seriously!!! Think of all the things you'll remember due to that fun glob of guke?You really should go buy this! like& NOW!!!"
9589,2941,5," As a family we play Cranium regularly. We were just getting to the point of repeating some of the cards. I remembered that I had heard that booster sets were available. I was delighted that when I searched on Amazon and found this set! Amazing value& much better than buying the latest boxed game from Cranium at over Â£20. Go for it& and have more hours of fun than you could imagine!"
9590,2941,5," These cards are a good idea - updates and freshen's your board and old Q's because you do eventually come across the same cards again. Very good value for money"
9591,2941,4," THIS IS A GREAT GAME FOR CHILDREN TO LEARN AS THEY PLAY& AND  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO A FRIEND"
9592,2941,5," Good fun for nights in with friends great game :0)"
9593,2942,4," My son loves Star Wars toys. He had an Ahsoka but her arm broke so this version is the replacement. The figurine comes with a little stand& for if you want to display it with your collection& a top trumps style card& lightsaber& backpack and stinky (Jabba's little son from the Clone Wars movie).The figurine looks good and my son plays with it every day so in that way it's value is excellent when you figure in the hours of fun for the price. Unfortunately& my problem with this and all Star Wars action figures is that whilst they are good toys for collectors they do not make good playthings. The lightsabers are always too easy to lose (he's lost it already) as the hands never grip them well. Really they should be designed with a solid hand grip with a hole to slide the saber into instead of individual fingers. The General Grievious figure is especially bad for this.Also& the limbs are so skinny that they are just asking to be broken. As replacement lightsabers and other accessories are not available individually you need to buy a new character if you lose anything. They really should sell a pack with assorted lightsabers and weapons as I'm sure they would sell well.Overall& it's a nice little action figure which is faithful to the looks of the Clone Wars cartoon character but don't expect it to last for ever if you buy it with the intention of playing with it."
9594,2943,5," I purchased this mega-tin in order to diversify my custom fire deck which began life as the onslaught of the fire kings structure deck& and it did just that!For starters the tin itself Is fantastic. I was sceptical of it being too large before having seen it but it turned out to be perfect. It holds several decks and packets of card sleeves quite comfortably. Also a very good looking tin which is always a nice bonus if you intend on making use of it.The cards themselves& the cards listed as included were all in good condition and I have already managed to use them all in duels and to great effect& particularly the fire king if your deck is fire fist heavy& as mine now is thanks to receiving six fire fists in this tin. The tin also included several bujin monsters which I instantly wanted to try& and having tested them In duel or two I then rebuilt my entire fire deck from scratch to include them.The only downside to this purchase was the fact I only received one fire formation card (trap) which are practically a necessity when using fire fist monster effects. However this is simply luck of the draw when opening boosters and would not discourage me from buying another.I have so far duelled against the water deck counterpart to the onslaught of the fire kings structure deck& a cyber dragon deck& a junk warrior deck and a custom spellcaster deck using some of the cards i received from this tin and managed to beat them all at least once.To my delight the order actually arrived two days early! Which is almost unheard of in my seaside town in northern Scotland!Overall very please with all aspects of the purchase and would most definitely recommend."
9595,2943,5," My grandchildren are obsessed with these card& the eldest who is 8 is on u tube taking about them&"
9596,2944,5," I am really happy with this booster box& I didn't manage to pull any of the three Egyptian God cards from the 36 packs but the cards I got were still good as it was great to see familiar old released cards from each Yu-Gi-Oh TV anime. This booster box is good value because its fairly cheap for the cards you get in the set and i like the mosaic rarity on some of the cards."
9597,2944,4," Ordered two of these boxes (36 boosters per box& 5 cards per pack with a Mosaic and a Rare in every one) and a bit annoyed they went down to Â£26 the next day but whatever. They were still a great deal at Â£29 and i got Slifer and Ra which are the main reason people will be buying these so if you definately want to get at least one i would buy several boxes or just buy the gods singly if you dont care about any of the other cards. This set has a lot of cool reprints like Cyber Jar and Injection Fairy Lily and some good staples like Pot of Greed as a Mosaic rare and Shard of Greed& Dark Magician of Chaos and Call of the Haunted as Rares. Theres a lot of cards i wish werent in it like all the |roid| cards (truckroid etc) but i guess all the older cards that could have replaced them are in Legendary Collection 3 and 4. Hopefully Amazon will be selling the Round 2 booster box just as cheaply as i still want a legal Obelisk"
9598,2944,5," Me and a friend bought these and went halves on the price& Got some pretty decent pulls& (no god card sadly) And we sat at work opened all the packs and just dueled all day in the office =)"
9599,2944,4," This box is great and there's some decent cards in it. I ordered this on the chance that I'd get an egyptian god card as they are possible pulls in theses packs.  But unfortunately I didn't pull any. But I got some good cards anyway so I can't complain. Just be warned if your buying these for the chance to get playable god cards then you might be out of luck.its a risk& like buying all big bulk sets like this. But I guess that's the thrill of opening yu gi oh cards haha."
9600,2944,5," I was happy with this buy not only because the amount I saved but the fact that I also got an obelisk the tormentor which just made this buy 3x as awesome as it was and it arrived on time which was awesome"
9601,2944,5," Worth every single penny. Just make sure when you order you choose the correct dispatcher& for instance& I live in UK so I choose a uk dispatcher as the cards will be the uk print and not any other country's& but then again America and EU are the same in terms of language&  but the ink used may be different. Also I pulled slifer which is the most expensive god card. I made my money back as well as getting awesome cards."
9602,2944,4," I got this when it was only Â£26 I was glad I waited I don't think I would of paid Â£45 etc the cards were good I got one of the god cards and some of the classic cards too"
9603,2944,5," Absolutly amazed& im so lucky me and my mate bought these and wernt expecting a god card because be thought there was like a 1/7 chance but ended up pulling 2!!! Oblisk the tormented and my favourite slyther the skydragon we are keeping the god cards but are going to sell the other cards. Brillient product& might buy again in future"
9604,2945,5," Quick delivery. I've filled a few more gaps in my collection& I'm very happy and I will certainly order again :)"
9605,2945,4," Ordered the Phantom Forces cards but instead received the Furious Fists pack. Not to worry though& the kid loved them. Arrived quickly too."
9606,2945,5," Another really nice product. All cards of a high glossy quality& with vibrant colours. These cards are firm and sturdy to withstand lots of playing and of course swapping any doubles. (Not that there were any doubles in this pack)"
9607,2945,5," Bought this + a primal pack for nostalgic reasons as I'm a bit too old for them now& all in all was a cool experience haha I even got 2 shinys in each pack I bought."
9608,2945,5," Arrived swiftly and packaged well. 100% authentic cards for a decent price. What more could you ask for?Pulled an EX card from my pack."
9609,2945,5," I bought five of these booster packs and on my last pack I got Mega Gengar Ex Secret Rare& proving they're not weighed"
9610,2945,4," Arrived on time and as described.  My son is addicted to these things!"
9611,2945,3," My son was happy with the cards& but i felt they were very overpriced"
9612,2946,5," Do you like magic cards? Do you want more? Then this is the cheapest way to get them in large volumes. It comes with 36 booster packs with 14 randomized cards and 1 land in each pack. There is not much else to say... Other than Return to Ravnica has the coolest land in any magic set (but that is just my opinion)."
9613,2946,5," The product have met the expectations. This expansion has great cards and playing Magic The Gathering is always a nice way to have a good time with family and friends."
9614,2946,5," I bought this booster box and split it 50/50 with my friend who is much more engrossed in the world of MtG than I am. He had a list of cards in his head that he wanted and had refrained from buying any boosters until this product arrived (which wasn't a very long time).So when the boosters arrived I let him pick his 18 packs and I got whatever was left. I had always planned on letting him pick the packs because that's the type of person I am (which will be clearer by the end). He opened all of his packs and was disappointed by the fact that he was getting foil commons and no mythic rares. While he was rushing through his cards I opened my packs very slowly& reading each card and not glancing at the last ones before I got to them.Whenever I came across an obviously decent card I would look up dumbfounded and ask him |I got this. Is it any good? It's called Niv-Mizzet& Dracogenius|. That got to him. But to really hit him hard I waited until he was finished cursing me and my luck before asking him about the next card in the same pack. |I also got a shiney card called Sphinx's Revelation. Is that one any good?|The night continued like this& which is what I wanted but didn't anticipate. So as everything went better than expected& I am giving this 5 stars."
9615,2946,5," One of my favourite sets& it some fascinating cards."
9616,2947,5," Very fun decks! I especially love the Eldrazi. I used these to aid in teaching my boyfriend how to play Magic and we really enjoyed them. (Note that these do not come with the full art lands that are being released in Battle for Zendikar& but the lands included are very pretty.) Now to buy the matching deck boxes!"
9617,2947,5," The plane of Zendikar has always fascinated me& for at first glance it is a wild world teeming with dangerous flora and fauna that beckons the bravest or the most foolhardy adventurers to test themselves in search for treasures. On second glance& one realizes this unstable plane full of mana vortices and shifting landscapes harbors a far darker and more dangerous secret that& should it escape this plane& will sow destruction across the Multiverse.This duel deck features two 60 card ready-to-play decks (of which there are a total of 12 rares)& along with 5 token cards for each deck that represent creatures which are to be put onto the battlefield when generated by other cards in the deck"
9618,2947,5," Great service and a very good product got slot of new cards I hadn't seen before"
9619,2947,3," I purchased this item as a birthday gift for my nephew& which he loves& however I was extremely disappointed with the way the item was packaged. The actually box containing the cards was really bashed and looked shabby and tatty& no care seems to have been taken when packaging up the item at all.  would have returned the item and asked for a replacement had I had a little more time before the birthday.  Very disappointing!"
9620,2948,5," this was what i exspected from munchkin& a load of bookmarks that i can use in any game of munchkin. i have decide to keep it as a collectors item."
9621,2949,5," Awesome"
9622,2950,5," The promo card and pin are amazing& the generations set is stunning and so glad radiant collection is a part of it! Price is a little steep however."
9623,2950,5," Perfect thankyou ^^"
9624,2951,5," as always peco products are ideal - able to re wire layout easily now"
9625,2951,5," Ideal"
9626,2952,5," top dealer  deal all the time"
9627,2953,5," all KATO products are high quality and well worth the price. ONLY issue s that not all have an english explanation included which is a bit of a problem. I have also not yet been able to find an electronic system for operating points other than the rather old fashioned blue coloured switches which are non digital."
9628,2953,5," Didn't realise it was posted in Japan & could've got it at gauge master. Still good"
9629,2953,5," Kato products are quality and this pack is at a bargain price."
9630,2954,5," The seep point motor was easy to fit and wire  in"

9639,2959,4," Very helpful for the information I needed."
9640,2959,3," A Present"
9641,2960,5," This wire is very good I'm stil using it."
9642,2961,5," I had a small problem with my delivery as my address is hard to find. But they sorted it out straight away. Sent another out the next day. They we're really helpful. The product itself is of great quality and very strong. Highly recommend them"
9643,2961,5," Normal quality track from Hornby.always good and faultless. Call me silly but I wish Hornby products like so many things these days I remember as a kid still had ' made in England ' stamped on them."
9644,2961,5," as described...good value and good quality......will and does make life a lot easier when building a new layout - will be back 4 more"
9645,2961,5," Very good value Hornby 'straights - works very well. Just what I needed for expanding my son's basic loop 'starter kit'."
9646,2961,5," Added to the enjoyment of the Train Set"
9647,2961,2," was bent and twisted  on arrival"
9648,2961,5," Perfect item & no problems ."
9649,2962,5," Thanks very much for such a good service!  Item was just what my husband wanted for our grandsons birhdays this year!"
9650,2962,5," Not used yet but looks just the job"
9651,2963,5," Alaway good value from Jadlam"
9652,2964,5," A basic addition to our wooden train set which our grandchildren love to play with. It works with the other brands that we already have."
9653,2964,5," Although it may be boring to buy& it's very essential for the track! My grandson loves his trains so but with confidence."
9654,2964,5," Grandson was very happy to be able to use these with his normal train set. We will be ordering more from this site"
9655,2964,5," A much needed product as most sets are short on straight track. Service was very good."
9656,2964,5," Daughter loved this. Great service wonderful item thank you"
9657,2965,5," Another good product from Peco&smooth&well designed and fits in very well with other Peco points purchased at the same time."
9658,2966,5," Item works."
9659,2967,5," Great price& great delivery& great product!"
9660,2968,1," I should have known better than to buy Hornby branded accessories. Don't waste your money on this rubber.Its not as pictured and drops to bits if you put even the slightest pressure on it.The postage was a total rip off as well& more than the item in fact.Find an alternative brand and buy that.Note to seller and/or Amazon: its difficult to rate a rubber in terms of |fun| and |educational value|.Maybe this should not be listed as a |toy|?"
9661,2968,1," this hornby track rubber is not very good& it does not look like the item in the picture and it does not perform well.if you want to buy a track rubber that will do the job very well then you should buy the peco track rubber!!!Peco PL-41 PL-41 Rail Cleaner"
9662,2968,5," I have always had this in my wish list& but never thought it would be any good.  I used it on the track of my set upa dn what a difference it has made& one of the trains had been skidding a bit on start up and I thought it was the train& but after using this it works properly.  I would highly recommend this product."
9663,2968,5," Bought this to clean the glue off the track after laying ballast. It works brilliant and cleans the track quickly and without any hassle. I would highly recommend this and would suggest all model railways get a clean with this. A Must Buy and really quick and excellent delivery. Great company to do business with."
9664,2968,4," product as described has kept the track cleanproduct delivered in good time and in good condition. What more can you ask of a rubber"
9665,2968,5," I was not sure if this would work on my very old railway set& however it did the job.I would recommend to  all prospective purchasers."
9666,2968,5," Nothing very much to say - good vale and sent promptly. Cheaper than I could find elsewhere. Why do model shops charge so much?"
9667,2968,3," It is a good rubber it is great to clean the track with& and easy to use. Overall quite good for it's price."
9668,2969,5," Great item& just what I wanted for my N-guage locomotive.  Package and delievery well within time.  Will recommend seller and buy again."
9669,2969,5," These decodes are thin and very suitable for the use I was putting them to.  Just what you need for dapol n gauge"
9670,2970,5," delivery good& product good quality"
9671,2971,4," Well made and looks good."
9672,2972,5," This small piece of track was vital to finish off the building of my laout on a Hornby trackmat. I had tried a couple of loacl shops but they did not have this piece& this seller was good because theer was no postage."
9673,2972,5," Exactly as described& recommended."
9674,2972,5," Good quality& works well."
9675,2972,5," good product"
9676,2973,5," Excellent quality as I would expect from a Japanese product"
9677,2973,5," love it. Great quality and great value. Thanks team"
9678,2974,5," Great"
9679,2975,5," These curves are of good quality and connect just fine to my layout. Cant think of anything else to say."
9680,2975,5," Just the job"
9681,2975,5," E"
9682,2976,5," Great item"
9683,2977,5," Excellent turnout. Works well for OO hornby and bachmann locos  and rolling stock too."
9684,2977,5," Kato HO points reliable& easy to use and install on layout."
9685,2977,5," Very robust"
9686,2978,4," They look OK on the layout"
9687,2979,4," Great little Locomotive full of charm. Obviously it looks like a curtain blue tank engine but with 4 wheels. Smooth runner& can handle trucks and coaches easily.Turned up earlier than expected well packaged.WORD OF WARNIG& On inspection when it was in the box& the cab steps were broken& fortunately I super glued them back together. But please check before you open it. Especially if this is a birthday/Christmas gift."
9688,2979,5," Father-in-law was very happy with his birthday present. Arrived in good time."
9689,2979,5," Hubby tells me it's excellent."
9690,2979,5," good addition to my lay out"
9691,2980,5," I bought this for accompanying my 2 year old sons wooden train set& this train is by far the best as the train is so well made and  its carriage joining is so much better than the old style magnetic ones causes so much less frustration for younger children"
9692,2981,5," very cute! great for around the bottom of a christmas tree.! mine arrived today and although i didnt put it together yet i put batteries  in the engine and watched it go across the carpet& delightful!! cant wait to see it all set up and running around my tree. i am very happy. for the price you just cant go wrong."
9693,2981,4," Good train set for that added touch around the Xmas Tree. Plenty of track for larger trees. Not fit for children due to small parts and light plastic."
9694,2981,5," Lovey little train set. Just perfect for going around the tree. You can build the track to be in the shape of circle or in the shape of an oval. No music but it does make train sounds . Only needs 2 double A batteries and takes a minute or two to set up. Good price and worth the money"
9695,2981,5," We love it& for the money you can't go wrong& fun thing to have around the Christmas tree& will be realistic when pines drop and trains stop due to leaves on the track :)Arrived very promptly."
9696,2981,5," good value for money&ideal decoration around the xmas tree"
9697,2981,5," love it& really noisy and lights up gave us a laugh and now looks great under the tree& even the cat likes it lol"
9698,2981,5," Absolutely love it and yes the track can be made smaller i did it& also yes the train rides around the track no the noise cant be switched off unless its switched off and sitting still&hope this helps  all oytoutðŸ˜ƒ"
9699,2981,3," Front of train jumps the track to where only one wheel is in contact with the track but the train will still run around the track.  This was using the round set up of the train tracks vs oval set up.  In looking at the engine& it may have been because the front wheels do not have a rubber band/gasket around them to keep them on the track where as the back wheels do.  The |Jingle Bells| song gets irritating after a bit& but the smoke coming out of the engine is fun to see.  It was good for the Christmas season and will be brought out again next year as the Christmas novelty and to appease the little kid in me."
9700,2982,2," This along with the other locomotives in this series is NOT A TOY but an adult collectable& but sadly as such falls down badly.It is almost all plastic even the rails& the driving wheels on my sample were stuck on at all sorts of odd angles"
9701,2982,5," will tell friend about this good over all producked and love it has it was what we where looking for"
9702,2982,5," I used to wait on the bridge at goodmayes for this engine to pass sometimes with my dad at the controls nice model times passed good finish"
9703,2982,5," just what i wanted for my partner' perfect for his callection we both love Steam Trains so these were great."
9704,2983,5," Really nice item as described& plus a great service."
9705,2984,5," Looks good...."
9706,2985,5," i just love theese models especially by corgi  every little detail correct  things in the past have dissapeard and its thanks to train spotters and supporters retired rail staff that the steam trains are still running today  our thanks to you"
9707,2985,5," The above model is really well made and detailed&I was lucky enough to ride on the footplate of this engine while it was in refurbishment at Leiscester and not in the final livery.The model is a reminder of a great day out"
9708,2985,5,""
9709,2985,5," Item is as described& at a very good price& was securely packaged and promptly delivered"
9710,2985,5," Bought it as a present and it seemed to go down well as he is a steam buff."
9711,2986,5," An excellent model& up to the usual standard and quality of Kato products. A superb runner& straight out of the box."
9712,2987,5," As per the description& nice kit."
9713,2987,5," very good"
9714,2988,5," Great service and product - well packed and quick. My son will love it :)"
9715,2988,5," Great speedy train."
9716,2989,5," beautiful item& ran well from the box"
9717,2990,5," Lovely little Kato tram set. Well-pleased."
9718,2990,5," Superb value for money. Also passed customs without duty or vat!"
9719,2991,5," Brilliant toy. Straight from Japan. My little lad loved this toy and was even interested in the Japanese newspaper they used as padding inside the box. Great!!"
9720,2992,5," Very pleased with this item"
9721,2993,4," Whilst I liked the item when it arrived when I wired it up it failed to work properly and was returned promptly to the supplierfor a replacement."
9722,2994,5," A beautiful model superbly detailed and presented."
9723,2995,5," Excellent service  arrived virtually next day and the cable is exactly what I required to show total internal reflection of light at an extremely good price."
9724,2996,5," Quality product BUT available cheaper elsdewhere"
9725,2997,5," A nice little train that my son loves. Happily fits onto his normal train track (brio). Good value for money."
9726,2998,4," Having first been marketed as part of the 'Kitmaster' model range in the early 1960s before passing into the hands of Airfix and now Dapol this kit is carrying its age well . It lacks the sophistication and level of detail that modern mouldings would incorporate & but nonetheless & with careful building and skilled superdetailing it makes up into a wholly convincing model of a Southern Railway 'Schools' class locomotive . Chassis kits exsist that allow the competent modeller to motorise this kit as an interesting addition to any 'Southern' based steam era model railway layout ."
9727,2998,5," Didn't know what to expect for the price& but it turned out ok. Painted and well weathered with lots of rust effects. Was never going to be motorised so is residing as scrap in a siding. More than pleased with the result. Have purchased two more different models for same purpose. Good delivery."
9728,2998,4," I'm no rail expert and so can only really comment on the way that this model went together and how the finished article looked. I wanted  this model for a museum display relating to post war nationalisation and found that it went together very well and made what looks to be an accurate model"
9729,2998,5," Nice kit quite easy to construct. Packed well for transit. Arrived in the time the seller estimated. Would buy again."
9730,2999,5," Had been trying to find a Polar express set for my little boy for over a year as he is obsessed with the film"
9731,2999,5," My son was so happy when he opened it for his birthday& it made his day and hasn't stopped playing with it! We'll exceeded our expectations and worth every penny!!!"
9732,2999,1," Purchased this from amazon.com much cheaper at about Â£120 with postage. Still massively dissapointed. Really poor quality. the carriage links easily come off& the cheap plastic tracks constantly come apart and the trains are really fiddley to position on the track and also come off constantly. I will definately go for hornby next time."
9733,2999,5," I had this bought for my 5 year old son for Xmas and he loves it! Anyone know where I can buy more track"
9734,2999,1," Terrible product. Looks great but track is made with cheap rubbish plastic so constantly comes apart causing train to derail  plus link between carriages is very poor. Literally every 5 mins I have to fix the track or set the train back up after its derailed (which takes ages)It's a disgrace they can sell this product for such a high amount of money when it is so shoddy. Extremely dissapointed!"
9735,2999,5," looks and sounds amazing my son will love it for Christmas"
9736,3000,5," Great price and product. Very pleased with purchase and service."
9737,3001,5," Excellent running engine just had it chipped to DCC and it is working great. Smooth running without issue. I have two of them."
9738,3002,5," I first bought this pack to start extend a basic Hornby set.The double track level crossing and extra track adds significant play value for the kids and can be set up for |steam era| with traditional gates or for the more modern configuration of two half barriers - both options are included in the kit.To buy the items separatly is more expensive& so what have you got to lose by buying this pack ?My original pack has now been incorporated in a much larger layout& but still the double level crossing is a very interesting and functional feature."
9739,3002,3," This is one of many track packs that you can buy to extend your train layout.I am still confused about which packs to buy for my particular layout.This pack includes the level crossing (dual) but not enough to make a complete inner loop to match the track mat.So my advice is to contact the model shop and ask for their advice. When you start getting into the 2nd and 3rd radius bends your head may well explode.Track can be bought separately but i do not know if this works out more cost effective.OO gauge is standard so you can buy other manufacturers track& Bachmann& PICO etcIt also pays to shop around& I noticed quite a variation in prices for track packs.The points that come with it are not DCC ready. They require some small clips (available separately& unless they are in the plastic bag containing the level crossing but I have not spotted them yet)to make the switched track live else your train just stops dead. No power to the track.Otherwise the product is ok.I have not assembled the level crossing gates as my boy has only just started playing with it.Happy New YearAfter many happy hours playing trains again with my son I can say that the whole experience has been a success.Level crossing is easily assembled. As for the track pack contents it contains the thhird radius.To match the track mat you need 2nd radius."
9740,3003,5," Bought this for my grandson& who has most of the power train set.  Delighted with this purchase. Thank you"
9741,3003,5," Grandson was over joyed with it Great System came within a couple of days ."
9742,3003,5," Excellent quality and very quick delivery"
9743,3003,5," Power Trains its very good toys"
9744,3003,2," Not really what I thought it would be. Grandson doesn't really play with it. Bit fiddly and not very interesting"
9745,3004,5," Train set was received quickly and well packaged. Very happy with my choice of train set& as was going to buy Chugginton interactive train set but after reading reviews changed my mind and opted for this train set. My 2 year old son is very happy playing |CHOO CHOO| as he calls it. The next best thing about it is the chugginton interactive trains (ie - wilson&brewster&koko etc) all fit the track.To round up very good buy for learning the London land marks and hours of fun for all."
9746,3004,5," My 17-month old twins girls love this set.  We got it a couple of months ago.  At first they only really played with the smaller vehicles on the floor(and learnt how to say words like |taxi|).  Then they started rolling them on the bridge.  And now they are assembling the track& rolling all the vehicles along and putting up the buidings& trees and people around it.  I like the fact that they are buildings of London and that the train is a tube train.  Quality seems great& although we haven't had it for that long yet.  Track pieces fit together easily and the tube train compartments attach with magnets& which are also ok for little ones to do on their own.  Only (minor) gripe is that most the buildings are rather flat and fall over easily."
9747,3004,5," A really charming train set& which helps my little girl to learn the London landmarks& and all the various vehicles (black cabs& tube trains& buses& etc) that one might see in the capital. There are absolutely loads of pieces and track& which really spark children's imaginations& though it must be said the adults probably get as much out of it& and there is much discussion as to where the landmarks should be placed! It keeps my little girl occupied for ages& and she asks to play with it daily& which is a good indication of its appeal to children."
9748,3004,5," My two year old son really enjoys playing with this train set and all the adults enjoy setting it up and pretending they know where all the different London landmarks are!  I've had lots of comments on how lovely it is.  My son quickly said the names of the landmarks and can now point them out when they come on t.v.Unfortunately the roof of one of the tube trains came off very quickly but we contacted London Transport and a bit of superglue soon fixed that!Would love to be able to buy extra bits for it."
9749,3004,4," Bought this for our two year old grand-daughter who had great fun with it. Not just with the trains& but with the little vehicles (with grandparents making suitable 'bee-baa' noises) and the model of the London eye& which actually goes round and round.  Her Dad had as much fun setting out the track& but we then combined it with another set from the same maker to make a really complicated layout. Good for learning the London landmarks. Only trouble with the scenery is that it tends to fall over easily!"
9750,3004,5," Had already bought the john crane train set for my little girl and was so impressed I bought this one for my niece who lives in London. Excellent gift and a toy that will last forever."
9751,3004,5," Bought this for my 2 year old.  We all love it& very durable and beautiful to look at.  Knocks Le Toy Van products into a cocked hat."
9752,3005,5," Perfect"
9753,3006,5," Wanted one of these for a while and it's exactly as I remeber the real wagon used to be.All I need now is the horse to go in it!"
9754,3007,5," Another great Bachmann model. Not much more to say other than keep an eye out for the scale as I fancied Blue Peter and my search didn't rule out the N gauge models."
9755,3008,5," A good driver figure for internal combustion type models& I bought a couple of these guys for my new Swift Sixteen railcar currently in the erecting shop.  Might have to see if I can fashion a drivers cap from something"
9756,3008,5," A1"
9757,3009,4," Some confusion over N and OO gauge but good basic& non photographic& backscene well printed on a decent paper in full colour."
9758,3009,4," Present for teenagers train table."
9759,3009,3," same as above."
9760,3010,5," fantastic"
9761,3011,5," excellent .thanks for  a hassle free transaction"
9762,3012,5," Great price and product. Very pleased with purchase and service."
9763,3013,5," Mint as described.Excellent all round thanks"
9764,3014,5," Great& I set was delivered really quick I think about 2 days& I set the track up using the track mat. everything worked fine& I have a son and daughter& who loves anything mechanical& and they love using it. recommend to anybody."
9765,3014,5," This was a gift meant for my nephew and he has fallen in love with it. Spending hours playing with it."
9766,3014,5," love it"
9767,3014,5," Excellent set"
9768,3015,5," I love these& they add such a good finishing touch to my model village.  I didn't use them connected to electricity to make them light up& but they would look amazing so.  Overall& very very pleased with them and such a good price too.  Highly recommended."
9769,3015,5," I bought these for my 3 year old grandson who is mad on lamp posts& he put white tack on them and puts them around his road play mat& he thinks they are great."
9770,3015,5," Good value"
9771,3016,5," Fantastic product"
9772,3017,5," Well done team. Train arrived on time. Runs well& Quality is 100% and well its just great service well done. I would have given a 6 star but you know the rules."
9773,3017,5," Excellent. Many thanks"
9774,3018,5," Present for son& he loved it!"
9775,3019,4," have just started to assemble this model today can&t see any problems other than part of the chassis seemed a little bent got around that problem ok nothing like a challenge a day"
9776,3019,4," a very demanding model but enjoyed building it all parts very clean and no flashing."
9777,3019,5," GOOD&PROMPT&RETURN OF POST SERVICE"
9778,3020,4," This type of backscene goes well with my industrial layout but should have more add ons as repetition does incline to spoil effect but would recommend this for first time railway modellers."
9779,3020,5," Not being a person who has a lot of time on their hands to paint a backscene& This fits in with what I want very nicely at a VERY reasonable price. In fact& it's a steal& and creates a very realistic scene to blend in with my 3 dimensional creations."
9780,3020,5," Excellent"
9781,3020,3," Spoilt by having people depicted. Mars the scale."
9782,3021,5," just like the ones we ride on around Tokyo"
9783,3022,5," Excellent! A great model train up to the usual Takara Tomy standard. Sound at this price is both a bonus and a revelation. No instructions in English but you won't need them. So good I bought another one. Different supplier but same high standard."
9784,3023,5," These Trumpeter kits are fantastic. The scale makes for a very impressive model."
9785,3024,5," I am delighted with all aspects of my purchase"
9786,3025,5," very good"
9787,3026,5," Bought this crane awhile ago it a great addition to my model railway.runs well."
9788,3026,4," Very nice model&runs very well&but can you ask seller to put instructions in English please......thank you"
9789,3026,5," Description& communication& Dispatch& all excellent thank you."
9790,3027,5," a fantastic toy for Driver Dan fans - comes with three plug in 'book' cartridges which each tell a mini story& and allows you to hear the 'all aboard' catchphrase of Driver Dan.a little removable Dan toy and a separate twinkle bird to go with it too.solidly made& a great toy IMHO!and mine came with batteries!"
9791,3027,4," I put this on my 2.5 year old daughter's Christmas wish list as she loves the television programme. It was an instant hit& has been played with consistently from the huge number she could choose from! The construction is pretty robust and she has loved putting the book cartridges in to hear the stories. They stories are short and there are only 3 to choose from but toddlers seem to love repetition& even if their carers don't. The sound quality isn't great (hence the four not five stars) and it was quite loud until I put some sellotape over the speaker& now it's much more tolerable! It came with batteries and you'll need a screwdriver to open the battery compartment. A definite hit& especially if the child knows the programme."
9792,3027,4," I bought this as a gift for my 3 yr old grandson"
9793,3027,5," I was lucky and had it on special for Â£13& really chuffed with it& haven't opened it yet as its a Christmas present but it looks lovely& driver Dan figure looks good& my two year old is going to love it& even though it says 3+& I probably would even purchase it at full price but I think I've had a bargain& and fast delivery too& in a well packaged box and easy to open& not wrapped in cello tape which takes forever to get into! Thank you very much :)"
9794,3027,5," This was the second birthday gift my son opened and that was it for the next few hours and it didn't have any batteries in for the first hour! Highly recommended. Yes the stories are very short but it is not about the stories but the interaction a child has with it."
9795,3027,4," My 2 year old loves this! It can be a bit loud but there is an off switch under it. The figures are a nice size to hold and move and the train as a whole moves well too"
9796,3027,5," my 3 year old was very happy with this toy its really durable can take being droped about the little books are easy for kids to put into hear great little toy"
9797,3028,5," This Hornby 1st class Pullman centre coach matches the Brighton Belle driving cars in livery& detail and quality. Recommended addition to make up your 5-BEL Brighton Belle 5-car set."
9798,3029,2," This car looks great but& within a few minutes of being taken out of the box to look at one of the wing mirrors fell off. Even though this is a collectors model and maybe not meant to be played with I think it should be more robust than this."
9799,3029,5," It's very good and looks cool"
9800,3029,5," Good product."
9801,3030,5," Great purchase"
9802,3031,5," Brilliant fast and efficient"
9803,3032,5," one for the collection."
9804,3033,5," arrived on time all bits were with it. excellent buy"
9805,3034,5," Lovely little models bring back memories of the wonderful series"
9806,3034,5," Ideal Christmas present"
9807,3034,5," Thank you"
9808,3035,5," As a proud owner of the real thing (but not a real taxi driver) I love these. Collecting as many as I can when they fall under a fiver! The real one is returning from 5 years in Sweden on 2nd September.....1500 miles. Not sure we will make it......"
9809,3035,4," nice toy"
9810,3035,5," Thanks"
9811,3036,5," Great& my 6 year old was chuffed to get this for Christmas& and loves playing with it."
9812,3036,5," arrived on time and as described. a happy customer here thanks!"
9813,3036,5," as far as I know it's fine I haven't seen it& it was a gift."
9814,3036,5," Fab quality tractor! My 3 year old loves this!"
9815,3036,1," Bought this for my son for Christmas& hitch broke after first day"
9816,3037,4," 6 year old is so excited - Eddie Stobart AND a Car Transporter - it's better than Christmas!It's well constructed& takes 7 standard sized toys cars& and was delivered in quick time.Drops a star for two reasons - maybe a couple of quid too expensive& and I have a sneaking suspicion that the tailgate may not be the most robust.  All in all very good however& and junior is thrilled."
9817,3037,4," would have had 5 stars if the cab had had a girls name printed on it. After all that is what they are famous for. Other than that great item. Grandson loved it"
9818,3037,1," Massively disappointed with this Corgi model.It's of flimsy plastic construction and the top car supports don't stay up.Also& the connector between the front truck and the trailer isn't very secure."
9819,3037,1," This was an expensive item at Â£17+It was disappointing for the child as it is far too fragile. The adjustable transporter frame collapses easily and the linkage for the two parts continually parts plus the end will not stay engaged in a vertical position.  This causes frustration for the child.  Many model cars do not fit this transporter model.Overall I do not rate this item as an ideal play model."
9820,3037,5," Great product. Although I echo other people's comments about the two halves detach easily. This was easily cured with a small modification to the coupling. Cut a clear plastic disc from the packaging approx 10mm in diameter& and put the screw through it so it acts as a washer."
9821,3037,2," Wasn't clear how many plastic parts there were& thought I was buying a die cast model."
9822,3037,1," I was very excited to receive this item as it looked so authentic. However& it is impossible to get both halves to stay together and as soon as you try and load cars on to it& it collapses. Very bad design but may be OK if you just want to look at it!"
9823,3037,5," Bought as a birthday present it is build well the trailers can part easily but put that apart it made a fantastic present ideal for any eddie stobart enthusiast out there highly recommended."
9824,3038,5," I'm in the process of building a model of the fire station my Father last served when he was in the London Fire Brigade.This AEC Mercury TL is an extremely good copy of a former Middlesex Fire Brigade (with which he served as well) that served in the LFB.I've got a set of new number plates on order for it& along with a new station designation sign and these will make it a perfect addition to my project.If someone is after a cheap version of the Â£100+ kit I've also got then this is the one to go for"
9825,3038,4," fine"
9826,3039,5," Excellent item in every detail. Very fast postage."
9827,3040,5," Just a superb model& bought it as a stocking filler for my son& now holds pride of place in his home.ConP"
9828,3041,5," Fantastic lorry bought for my husband who collects them these are as good as the corgi models very authentic  great trailer too in tesco company on the side curtains highly recommended."
9829,3041,4," This is a very good scale model suitable for a modern model railway setting or as collectable model& mine has a few places where the tampo printing is not 100%"
9830,3041,5," my son love this oxford diecast stobart 1/76 scale truck"
9831,3041,4," good quality and value"
9832,3042,4," This a must for every james bond fan! Its not a toy to be played with but to display on the shelf as the cars are repilicias of the james bond cars. They can be used to play with but it would be shame as very collectable. Also the nearest thing to a real db5 as far to expensive to buy the real car!"
9833,3043,5," An excellent kit with lots of detail that builds into a fine model  . As far as I am aware this is a re-issue of a former Italeri kit . It is & however & nonetheworse for that & as Italeri produced an exquisite series of 1/24 scale classic Ferrari GT cars ."

9847,3051,4," These ex-LNER Gresley teak-bodied buffet cars& built in the 1930's& survived long enough to receive all three British Railways coach liveries& crimson and cream& the maroon depicted here and finally the blue and grey used from the mid-1960's (in which this model is also available).  Presumably they lasted so long as a new buffet car cost much more than a new ordinary coach to build.  It's stated on the Net that the last one was withdrawn in 1977 from Western Region use as W9135E.This model is up to the usual standard of recent Hornby coaches and& whilst a scale person wouldn't fit into the gap between the seats and tables& you must peer in through the windows to appreciate the best interior detail.  It's a lovely little bar/counter complete with chrome edging& an (empty) transparent sandwich display case& what looks like a chrome coffee-maker and one of those metal foot-rests running the length of the bar/counter complete with the little pegs that hold it above floor level.  No stools though& presumably to encourage folks to buy the curly sandwiches& over-priced drinks and then bog off back to their seats leaving it clear for more punters to part with their hard-earned.There's also a representation of the hand-rails at the windows by the buffet bar/counter to hold onto going over the points at junctions (or after a few expensive tinnies (which is all they used to have (and still do as far as I'm aware) in the beers department.  Some of the widow top-lights are realistically set in the open position as would be the case on originals.  On the blue and grey liveried coach& the red line under the roof telling folks this is a buffet (if they can't read it on the coach side) is also present.  There's a black line in its place on the maroon ones.Read more â€º"

9851,3054,5," Perfect-- as advertised"
9852,3055,5," I purchased this model because it was the one featured in the BBC program |Wartime Farm|.  Manor Farm is in the local area and I have made a small diorama to form part of my model railway. As with all Oxford Diecast models it is superb& and excellent value"
9853,3055,5," This item is just typical of Oxford's models. The detailing is superb and fits perfectly on my model rail layout."
9854,3055,5," No really understanding the scale& I expected this to be 3-4 times bigger& its about 2 inches long but the detail on it is very good indeed.

9862,3057,5," Awesome"
9863,3058,5," A model with wonderful colours that stands out amongst the rest. Wild frames usually look pretty good and Fenrir is no exception. His open hand allows him to hold his rifle scope up to his eye and gives a good standing pose. Mainly his stickers are the large white linings on his armour.The tail isn't half black and half brown unless you paint it. It's fully brown with a small black sticker that fits in the middle. Also the rifle is black plastic with no stickers despite being mostly green. Looks great when displayed"
9864,3059,5," This is an excellent well detailed and sturdily constructed model. Highly rate this manufacturer. Ideal for children and adult collectors too."
9865,3060,4," Nice model of the Type 45 destroyer. They seem to make 4 in the class Dauntless& Dragon& Daring and Duncan and I have all 4. I was hoping they would add Diamond and Defender to. There was originally supposed to be 12 in the class but as with everything else this was cut back to 6 which is a shame. Same with the type 23 frigates was 13 now only 8."

9873,3067,5," I collect AutoArt diecast models& either bought from the MiniModels website& or else from Amazon. I have a couple of dozen or so& including this Lamborghini& which my girlfriend gave to me one year as a present. The AutoArt models which I own all have the following in common. They are exacting in the attention to detail& both exterior and interior& and are made from very high quality materials which give a good tactile experience& even the tyres are nice to touch. The alloys look great and the paintwork is vibrant and eye catching.I bought my first AutoArt model about five years ago and it still looks as good as the day I opened the packaging. The Achilles Heel with these quality models& is the windscreen wipers& which can snag on a cloth if you're dusting and get damaged. I stupidly made that mistake once (and just the once!). The best thing to do is to exhibit your cherished model inside a display case or cabinet& free from dust. You can buy a suitable display case for this model& either from Amazon& or else from the MiniModels website.I take great pleasure in looking at my collection of AutoArt models at home& which now includes a couple of Porsche 911's& a Bugatti Veyron& Koenigsegg CCX& Pagani Huayra& and a couple of Ferrari 599's. Of all of my collection& I think that the orange coloured Koenigsegg CCX is probably the most stunning& you might want to take a look at one on the MiniModels website if it's not currently available from Amazon.It's always worth price-checking between the Amazon and MiniModels websites& if you're looking to buy a high quality diecast vehicle.Thank you for taking the time to read this review."

9879,3071,5," although i didn`t read correctly the size of the car. i thought it was average size dinky or corgi size. but the detail is fantastic but very small."

9881,3071,3," Ok"
9882,3072,5," Very authentic and detailed& it even had the same wheels (style 104) as my Z4. My model came in white& my own car is silver& but hey its good enough for me.It was delivered well boxed and unblemished& a good model at a really good price."

9892,3077,5," This is a very good toy worth waiting for& a good size robust and good detailing. I was surprised that the car has a metal diecast body."
9893,3077,5," There was a situation when he was driving the volvo estate (being hitched in the picture) and the rear wheels came off. However it was a simple case of glue on the axel and let it set ( I used CA glue you can google it) It set in minutes and the wheels never came off again.

9914,3091,5," Oxford Diecast has been around for years as an offshoot of Corgi Toys until they went it alone. And have they made up for lost time with a range which is enlarging almost by the week. This J2 is fantastic with faultless paintwork to a casting that's crisp and correct to the real van. It's also a very heavy model with only a few plastic parts of real solid quality. Oxford have now produced many other variations of this little van from a parcels van to even a cast mobile caravan. Also to come in 1.43rd scale will be a Bedford HA van and an early Bedford CA (cav type) with a long list of cast variations!. Corgi have a lot of catching up to do here as Oxford Diecast have created it's own slot that Corgi have ignored for years."

9934,3102,4," This is a very nice model of a 1970 Dodge Charger as used in the film Fast and Furious. The paintwork is excellent and there is a lot of detail on the model extending to the inclusion of an internal roll-cage& steering wheel and dashboard. Chrome around the windows is very good but not perfect where some black bodywork paint has bled over onto the chrome in one place under the drivers window. Detail and paintwork around the front grill and back bumper is very good marred slightly by a little overpainting visible around the front indicators& but you will have to look closely to spot this. Close inspection will reveal excellent lettering detail on the fuel cap and a 'Charger' logo on the front grill. The chromed wheels are beautifully done with tyre tread well pick out. The supercharger seems slightly off-axis but not enough to spoil an otherwise excellent model. The criticisms made should be kept in context - they are minor& nothing is perfect& and overall I consider this a very impressive model well worth adding to any collection. Highly recommended.Only 4 stars? Yes& I have models that do beat this one and they are worthy of 5 stars. But you will not be disappointed by this one& it's a cracker."
9935,3102,5," My grandson was so so pleased with his dodge charger"

9944,3108,5," no problems"
9945,3109,4," Not given as gift yet but detail not as good as expected"
9946,3110,5," This was bought for a Christmas present but was not needed as I bought a number of different models to determine the one I wanted.  I think all the Vespa models need a little more explanation"
9947,3110,4," As with other reviews it did not come in blue& but red. A choice of colour would be nicer than falsely advertising the blue.Other than that it is a nice model and the gift was received well."
9948,3110,5," Bought it for my little grandson without realising that it is not a toy as it does not stand up on its own. However he is delighted with it."
9949,3110,3," Was a different colour from what was advertised which was a bit disappointing. Would be better to have a colour choice when selecting."
9950,3111,5," Thankyou the delivery is very good & and the car looks like the real car as I did drive the real car it did bring meney happy memories back & I had the car for years& would you tell me if you do bigger cars if you do I will buy them"

9969,3121,4," i loved the replica& except for a few errors on the detailing. the front bonnet does not perfectly sit on top of the front bumper& and so& takes away the level of detailing you would expect in a replica worth this amount of money& as i have found an exact same one in another shop& for a slightly lower price."
9970,3122,5," Despite being a lesser known car that was only briefly seen in 'For Your Eyes Only&' this is still a great model with some great details& including the car's interior.

9975,3125,4," Very pleased with this model. It's really nice as an ornament.I can't exactly give the best opinion as it's my first diecast that I've bought and/or built but& well& the quality wasn't really amazing. Don't get me wrong this looks really lovely but when I received it one of the screws were kind of chipped meaning the threads weren't straight so it meant the screws wouldn't go in all the way. Another thing is its not exactly the be all end all as it was free but the screwdriver was a bit shabby and you couldn't get any torque out of it so struggling to find a screwdriver the size was a bit annoying and took longer than needed. Wow I'm rambling on lol.Overall the product is really good especially for a first try and the materials could be better but are way more than adequate."
9976,3125,5," A great product. I gave this as a gift and he loved it. Definitely recommended. Hours of fun to build and years of fun dreaming about the real full size version."

9978,3125,5," Nice little model my husband who is a bike fan enjoyed putting this together and its now sitting in his gaming room&& very nice model & fast delivery& good price"
9979,3126,5," I brought this as a cake topper for my uncles 60 th Birthday cake. It was perfect !"
9980,3127,5," very good"
9981,3128,5," I'm a very long term and very devoted collector of AutoArt diecast models& either bought from the MiniModels website& or else from Amazon& and my girlfriend always gives me a model as a present on my Birthday& at Christmas& and for our anniversaries.I have a  few dozen cars in my collection now& including this particularly stunning Lamborghini. The AutoArt models which I own all have the following qualities in common. They are exacting in their attention to detail& both the exterior and interior& and are made from very high quality materials which give a good tactile experience& even the rubber tyres are nice to touch. The alloys look great and the paintwork is vibrant and eye catching. The models are quite heavy and need to be handled with care.I bought my first AutoArt model car about six years ago and it still looks as good today as the day I opened the packaging. The one Achilles Heel with these quality models& is the windscreen wipers& which can snag on a cleaning cloth if you're dusting them and get accidentally damaged. I stupidly made that mistake once (and just the once!)& with the burgundy coloured and gold wheeled Michael Mann limited edition of the Ferrari 599.The prudent and best thing to do is to exhibit your cherished model inside a display case or cabinet& keeping it free from dust and finger grease. You can buy a suitable plastic or wooden display case for this model& either here from Amazon& or else from the MiniModels website.I take immense pleasure in looking at my collection of AutoArt models at home& which now includes a fleet of Porsche 911's& several Bugatti Veyrons& a Koenigsegg CCX& a Pagani Huayra& and very many different types of Lamborghinis and Ferraris.Read more â€º"
9982,3129,5," great value for money"
9983,3130,4," I was a little disappointed by the size of it& i thought it would be bigger. Other than that. I was happy with the packaging and delivery of this item"
9984,3130,5," daughter loves it"
9985,3131,5," I was pleased with the earlier purchase and re-ordered to pass this set on to a young enthusiastwho was impressed by the way the london Taxi has developed over the years"
9986,3132,5," These cars are fantastic& arrived so fast& high quality& and most of all a very happy son!"
9987,3132,5," Brilliant. Very detailed little cars."
9988,3132,5," My son loves these cars."
9989,3133,5," great offer"
9990,3134,4," The model is good& but is in complete the model is in a clear case with no cover for it."
9991,3135,5," Son ordered this product and is very happy with both product and delivery."
9992,3136,5," my niece loves Mr Whippy and she loves cows so thought this was a brilliant gift"
9993,3136,5," very good"
9994,3137,5," Arrived in quoted time despite the Christmas mayhem. Received well packed and undamaged. Excellent kit with fine& crisp mouldings. Choice given on wheel& interior and exterior mirrors. Unfortunatly& no information given to be year correct with the wheels and mirrors. An extremly minor niggle for a excellent model."
9995,3138,4," I have a lot ofr Siku toys& its a very good brand& very strong. This one was a little weaker than I was expecting& hence the 4 stars instead of 5. The cab is metal and very strong but the arm and bucket are plastic and feel a little weak. Its still brill and I would recommend it."
9996,3138,4," GREAT  WELL PLEASED  AS ADVERTISED"
9997,3139,5," r arrived been looking for this model for ages  as a colletor"
9998,3140,5," fantastic model of the land rover defender 90 tdi&incredible detail well worth the price."
9999,3141,4," This is an adorable present that I'm really happy with and sure my boyfriend will love! However is a little smaller than expected. Also came in a thin& flimsy box  so had to switch before wrapping it up as a gift. Overall pleased!"
10000,3141,3," Nice item& but box was ripped and battered. As the item is a gift& the box is completely unusable. So that was disappointing. I also had a personal message which again& is unusable as marks all over the message and inn smudged. Item is nice bit overall I'm disappointed!"
10001,3141,5," Great little secret Santa gift for a work colleague who has a slight love of bikes....just wish they hadn't put a sticker on the back of the package asking for a five star review ...but the product is good so I won't begrudge them of that too much."
10002,3141,4," This is a present for a motorbike mad friend and I'm fairly sure he will love it as it looks sturdily made - not sure how accurate the detail is but no doubt he'll tell me! The only downside is that the presentation box was somewhat marred by the fact that one of the handlebars was sticking right through it and one end of the box was torn.......not what you really want to see when giving something as a present. Not sure if this was because of inadequate packaging in transit or if it was because the motorbike was being forced into an already rather tightly fitting box in the first place. I've mentioned this to the seller as it stopped me from giving a 5* rating."
10003,3141,5," Ah love this one! Riding a motorbike myself& bought this for my office desk as a constant reminded that my bike is waiting for me downstairs. )) looks very nice. Amazing present for a rider"
10004,3141,5," Bought this for my bike mad Husband for his birthday.  Lovely gift and looks good on the fireplace. It's the closest he will be getting to a Harley.. ha ha ha ha"
10005,3141,5," Excellent purchase My Husband admires Harley Davison motorcycles and it's the nearest he is ever going to get to the real thing!"
10006,3141,3," The product is a heavy item and as an ornament it looks good. My problem was with the packaging. The item is loose within its box and so during travel it rattles around and invariably it damaged the box. Not a problem if you're buying for your self but if buying as a gift it detracts from the presentation when there's a ruddy big hole in the box"
10007,3142,5," Great item& my wee boys is delighted& thanks"
10008,3143,5," wonderful scale model& great detail."
10009,3144,5," I drive one of these.. and from a few extra blue lights missing (due to its small scale) its very very close to the real thing... down to the reg plate numbers!!!"
10010,3144,5," Great item present for grandson"
10011,3144,2," Smaller than expected"
10012,3145,5," This is a great die-cast model of an Ausa M50.The Ausa M50 is made almost entirely from metal and has working suspension and a tipping back section.The model is also very nicely painted in orange gloss and metallic grey paint and looks very smart.My only minor criticism is that it doesn't have steering but the model more than makes up for that with it's excellent build quality."
10013,3146,5,""
10014,3146,5," nice model at good price"
10015,3147,5," Superb detailing (as one might expect of Oxford diecast) and it's a model which features in several books on the history of especially military Land Rovers. It's certainly not a toy - but a great addition to Land Rover ephemera and model collections. With the impending demise of UK built Defenders I expect the company will be producing more vehicles representing the marque from 1948 onwards - I'll need some more shelf space!"
10016,3148,5," Very reasonably priced& great quality and it's a really cool looking collectible. Looks great on shelves and stuff. The girlfriend loved it so thats a plus! Really nifty gift idea for fans of the show."
10017,3148,5," Amazing product and considering where this came from delivered quickly"
10018,3148,5," Very cute little Pop! Great for Firefly fans"
10019,3149,5," Loki rocks!"
10020,3149,5," GREAT ITEM"
10021,3150,5," My grandson received these as part of his 7th birthday gifts. The price made them excellent value and they provided great fun when played with on his Max Steel fight arena."
10022,3150,4," My 5 year old son loves this toy& although it takes a bit of getting used to& and we probably should have bought the |tray| that it goes with."
10023,3150,4," Absolute bargain would recommend this buyer very quick service and an ideal stocking filler our son loves these."
10024,3151,3," Ok because its Ben 10 and if that is what your child likes then they will like these toys. However the B10 range has 2 figure sizes these 10cm and a 15cm. The 15cm is the one you want it is a proper action figure. big solid and impressive. Put these 10cm figures with it and they look a lot less fun shall we say.  So in short look for the 15cm figures over these if you can."
10025,3151,5," Item arrived ahead of time and was very greatful as it was bought as a present. A definite must for any child who enjoys the Ben 10 series and in particular the Omniverse series."
10026,3151,3," I have bought quite a few Ben10 figures for my Grandson& and this was not one of the best& quite small and thin compared to most of the others& but still my Grandson loved it."
10027,3151,5," grandsons thrilled& really pleased with the service and value for money from this company. Will definately use them again and thoroughly recommend them to anyone."
10028,3151,4," the Ben Ten figure arrived (with two others) within the time stated and well packaged. It was great value for money and my grandson was really pleased."
10029,3151,5," Another birthday gift.  Looks great and I`m sure it will be just what he`s asked for.It has been on his list for sometime."
10030,3151,5," I bought this toy as the first one from the new Ben 10 series as it is my favourite so far - fortunately my son conquers!"
10031,3151,5," A nice size with movable part's witch is always a plus with smaller sized kids toys. Good quality at a nice price."
10032,3152,5," My grandson was really excited when they arrived as he is minimates mad& lots of detail on figures."
10033,3153,3," Bought this as a Christmas present for my Sister's boyfriend as he loves Star wars and this is apparently his favorite character. The figure is lovely and well made but sadly the box has been torn and bashed around a bit. I don't think he will mind as he isn't a serious collector so I don't think he will even use the box. But for people who actually collect these and keep them in the boxes& it might be an issue...I'm a tad embarrassed to give it to him at Christmas as it does look a bit scruffy but my sister insisted that it wont be an issue in this case."
10034,3153,1," The action figure was in great condition but it was the wrong one. I did not get this version of Han Solo. Very disappointed."
10035,3153,5," Arrived quickly& well packaged.  I am very pleased with my Han Solo ~ great addition to my collection."
10036,3153,4," The box was dented without adequate protection& the reason why I didn't give 5 stars"
10037,3153,5," great quality& great price& great for collection"
10038,3153,5," My son loves collecting Star Wars bobble heads"
10039,3153,4," The box was slightly crumpled"
10040,3154,5," My son got this as a present about 2 years ago and he still plays with it in the bath.. the pump actually works and shoots out water really well. Its been dropped a few times but there's been no damage& also it hasn't got mouldy (unlike some bath toys). We have some toy fish and my son pretends he is fishing or catching a naughty shark... lots of fun to be had. Definitely recommend this toy."
10041,3154,5," I bought this for my nephew's son aged four and a half. He has other playmobile pieces but I thought this was an excellent choice to take with him to the bath. In all he's delighted with it and I think my twentysomething nephew has fun too."
10042,3154,5," Brilliant toy - great fun to be had.  3 year old loved it though watch for those small parts."
10043,3154,5," As described. Arrived on time"
10044,3155,5," Very cute& a lot better quality than I thought as I've never bought bullyland products before. Will be buying more."
10045,3155,5," Very Happy with my purchase and was a fast delivery."
10046,3156,5," Good price"
10047,3157,5," Fantastic figure!"
10048,3158,5," Fantastic service!!!  Couldn't be better ðŸ˜€"
10049,3158,5," Very  good  and fast delivery"
10050,3158,5," Fab I love it !! Super cute!"
10051,3158,5," Love it arrived perfectly"
10052,3158,5," so cute!"
10053,3159,5," I collect funko pops and I must say I do like this on its a nice touch on deadpoopl and the paint work is great some aren't but theys are not hight end toys."
10054,3159,4," Bought this for my son and he was over joy with it"
10055,3159,5," Fab& would recommend fast delivery too"
10056,3159,5," Awesome toy! Great for a collector!"
10057,3159,1," Really bad paint job!!"
10058,3160,5," My 3 year old son loved this for his birthday! Hasn't stopped playing with it and talking about it. The foam padded sides of the hammer makes it not too lethal to play with too. Definitely gets a thumbs up from me and my little one"
10059,3160,5," Good product but disappointed to find mere mortals are capable of picking it up... Probably something worth a mention in the product description..."
10060,3160,5," Bought as a Christmas present for the 6 year nephew so he has got it yet but he has seen it in the shops and wanted it so guess he likes it. The dog doesn't though when you button it does make quite a load lightening sound. It is light weight but very sturdy and covered in sponge . Would recommend"
10061,3160,4," This was bought as a birthday present for my nephew last year.  He certainly enjoyed playing with it as soon as he opened it.  The only qualm I have with the product is that it seems quite flimsy& especially for a hammer!  I didn't expect it to be heavy& just not as light and fragile as it seems."
10062,3160,4," Great for little Thor fans. Lightweight and hammer bit made from foam so if it does impact with anything by accident no major dents. and the sound effects and lights are great."
10063,3160,5," My 3 year old son has wanted this for months and loves it. Padded hammer (thou would still hurt if hit with it!) Cheaper here then in shops so very happy."
10064,3160,1," Bought this product for my nephew& he couldn't lift it up because he isn't worthy.Seller did not mention this possibility."
10065,3160,4," My son was delighted a receiving this a Christmas. It is very durable"
10066,3161,5," Wow!! I simply cannot recommend this enough! Looks way better than the picture and goes nicely with the weeping angel bobblehead .Go on all you whovians get your wacky DAVE T bobble!!!!!!!!"
10067,3161,5," Bought as Crimbo gift& person who got it was ecstatic loves it too bits. Typical Funko well made good quality."
10068,3162,5," This POP! Is an awesome example of great design and hand painted skills. The details are amazing andante finish is superb.It will make any Disney POP! Collection look polished"
10069,3162,5," My little boy Arlo was delighted with his pop Arlo figure for Christmas! Great addition to his little collection!"
10070,3162,5," Fantastic item my daughter loves it"
10071,3163,4," The Grimlock Transformer is the easiest transformer we have owned and my 6 year old son really likes it.  At first he was a bit intimidated by the process of transforming it& so it was down to Mummy and Daddy& but once he cracked it& he enjoyed the challenge and showed real pride in his handy work.  This toy is great for a bit of parent/child bonding and giving your child something to achieve and feel good about."
10072,3163,4," Thought it wouldn't be used a lot as my son is quite young for the toy but after a few assisted 'transformation's' he got the hang of it and enjoys transforming it back and forth as well obviously using it to play with. Sturdy and well made in comparison to these types of toys in general."
10073,3163,5," My son loves transformers and this is a welcome addition to his collection. Well done Hasbro on creating another transformer that is able to transform easily and is very well constructed and would take a lot to fall apart.  A good solid product."
10074,3163,5," This was brilliant...he loved it. The transforming action was easy to do and he had a lot of fun playing with it. The size made it ideal for taking out with us for entertainment in the car/restaurants etc also."
10075,3163,5," Really easy to transform.  Seems very well made and will take a bit of a beating.  Excellent for my 8 yr old son."
10076,3163,5," Really pleased how quickly this arrived especially at Christmas time. Packaging just right. Grandson loves it"
10077,3163,4," My son loves the Transformers Grimlock robot and he is pleased with the product."
10078,3163,5," Another hit with my son and easily transformed!"
10079,3164,3," Bought as a present but a lot smaller than I thought. Good detail."
10080,3164,5," Great likeness. 11-year-old daughter very happy. Good quality."
10081,3165,5," Cute"
10082,3166,5," I have a collection of Marvel and DC items which date back to when I was a child so when I bobble head characters last year and I knew I had to add them to my collection.This is Pop Marvel number 91 Black Widow character from the â€œMarvel Avengers â€“ Age of Ultronâ€ movie.The Widow is dressed in her iconic catsuit with electro-charged batons.Her base is much more delicate than the other figures and this means that she is much less stable and far more likely to fall with the slightest table bump.There are now 10 characters in the â€œAge of Ultronâ€:- 66 â€“ Ironman- 67 â€“ Captain America- 68 â€“ Hulk- 69 â€“ Thor- 70 â€“ Hawkeye- 71 â€“ Vision- 72 â€“ Ultron- 73 â€“ Hulkbuster- 91 â€“ Black Widow- 95 â€“ Scarlet WitchI expect Quicksilver to be added to the set soon.Regardless of the balance problem she is still a beautiful little figure and I am happy to have her join my collection."
10083,3166,4," This Black Widow figure is absolutely stunning"
10084,3166,5," Bought as a present. Excellent similarity to the real character! My brother loves it& so I'm happy."
10085,3166,5," Bought for Daughter a Christmas gift will be well pleased to find under tree !"
10086,3166,5," Brilliant excellent delivery and item very happy with purchase"
10087,3166,5," Very pleased with item quick delivery would use again"
10088,3166,5," Bought for my niece. One happy little girl."
10089,3166,5," Great product& delivered on time"
10090,3167,5," Good quality& my son had been looking forward to receiving it and was not disappointed"
10091,3167,5," As described"
10092,3168,5," A must for the minecraft fan. Fun set of the characters. well packed and fast delivery."
10093,3168,5," Got this for my daughter and she is really enjoying them.  The only negative is that the paint on the wolf rubbed off on the first day."
10094,3168,5," Arrived very quickly& used amazon locker service which works brilliantly. Figures are a good size& sturdy and daughter loves them. Was the best price I'd found too."
10095,3168,5," Fantastic wee set of characters& all moveable. I did have to return this set as they were duplicated as a birthday gift& but I was very tempted to keep both. You get six well designed characters& all neatly printed (sometimes printing of features on these things is dire& wonkey eyes etc)& and well proportioned as a set. Maybe a bit steep price wise& but to be honest I think its good value. Amazon further reduced them just as I was buying and gave me super saver shipping. I think this is a must buy for Minecraft fans!"
10096,3168,5," Brought this for my son's 9th birthday as he wanted a minecraft  cake so I put these on top of cake I made and he loved it throught it was cool Bless his heart ."
10097,3168,5," Even if you don't know what minecraft is (count me in) you'll love these - great quality"
10098,3168,5," Very well made! Child very happy with the design and quality of toys& spends lot of time playing with these little characters"
10099,3168,5," Great figure for any minecraft fan! My 5 year old loves these and plays with them regularly!"
10100,3169,5," At first I couldnt decide about ordering this one or slightly cheaper version. But so so so pleased I got this one. For starters& with a two and six year old& they get a scoop and cone each& so no arguing over taking turns. And the sugar shaker is adorable and this absolutely made it all the more fun& after scooping up sand onto the cone& selecting a shell for a cherry& a pebble for the 99 flake& my kids then saw the shaking of sugar/sprinkles on top as the best bit. Yes& you have to made sure you fill it with dry sand so the holes don't clog up& but we managed this fine on the isle of Wight beaches& and at home in the sand pit. The bucket they are all stored in is wonderful too. Every child should have one of these sets!!!!"
10101,3169,5," My daughter absolutely loves it! The Ice cream bucket looks smaller on the picture but it is a decent size. The shaker is real fun.All the pieces fit into the bucket. Very pleased with the purchase."
10102,3169,5," My kids love playing in their sandpit and have a whole range of toys& but this is definitely their favourite.  They spend hours making ice creams and carrying them round the garden!  Big hit."
10103,3169,5," A bit different from your usual bucket and spade set. Hours of fun making sand ice creams with sand sprinkles!"
10104,3169,5," Lovely little set that ours and the neighbours kids got great use of. Easy to use& and a little different from the usual sand toys. Will get a few summers out of these sand toys."
10105,3169,4," my little girl loves making ice-cream for me with this set & everything packs away in the bucket so is great for a day at the beach too & a strong well made toy."
10106,3170,3," Nice enough playset& but contains only the Duggee figure& the rest of the squirrels gang have to be bought separately. The one problem I have with this set is that it doesn't look much like the clubhouse from the cbeebies cartoon& the colours just aren't right which is a little odd.The Duggee figure comes with a detachable piece of plastic in which to stand him otherwise he just falls over. I feel the stand should be permanently attached as considering the target audience for the show and thus the toy the plinth can be easily lost or pose a choking hazard. Parents beware.It's cheap plastic& fun& but probably overpriced."
10107,3170,4," so cute!!One thing only& the plastic feet is not really strong.Without it figurine is unable to stand up"
10108,3170,5," Wish it had the other figures with this...."
10109,3170,5," Amazing! Much bigger than I expected"
10110,3171,5," I bought this item& with the white lace and black bows and it's a beautiful product of very high quality. It matched perfectly with my french maid costume& also from leg avenue."
10111,3172,5," Very good quality."
10112,3173,4," Very pleased arrived very fast exactly how described i ordered this and the other characters from jungle book to use as cake toppers for this cake they are perfect"
10113,3173,5," Bought for a couple crazy about monkees& as a hidden surprise to their wedding cake. Great fun"
10114,3173,5," My Grandchild's favourite character and this figurine didn't disappoint."
10115,3174,5," Great likeness to the Peanuts character Lucy with the bossy facial expression! Nice collectible as she is dressed in a different outfit to the classic blue dress."
10116,3175,5," A Christmas present for my four year old grandson. He loves Lego and Chima& so was delighted with the Cragger's Fire Striker and built it with help from his daddy. Now enjoys playing with it together with other Chima models and action figures."
10117,3175,5," pretty sturdy!better than 2014 chima in this respectstill in one piece 2/12 after building."
10118,3175,5," Another excellent construction in the Lego range."
10119,3176,5," What a lovely product"
10120,3177,3," Not bad for a cheap figure but doesn't do very much and not very big."
10121,3177,5," Item good"
10122,3178,5," Very cute. Ideal size for what I need it for. Looks good quality."
10123,3178,5," Perfect gift for my girlfriend& she and I loved it! Great quality and condition& I love these pops!"
10124,3178,5," Brilliant& cute little figures my little girl loves them and was so happy when she opened them."
10125,3178,5," Fast delivery.Very pleased with my purchase.Highly recommend."
10126,3178,4," ðŸ‘ðŸ»"
10127,3179,4," My friend thought they were brilliant.  One small problem - they were quite difficult to keep standing up!!"
10128,3179,5," Bought for a Saturday night takeaway themed party. Great size to have photos taken next to."
10129,3179,5," Perfect for my friend as she's an avid fan!!"
10130,3180,5," Bought as a present. Excellent similarity to the real character! My brother loves it& so I'm happy."
10131,3180,5," Bought it for a friend for a present& she loved it. As small and cute as they are& the detail is outstanding and it is straight away recognisable as the Dark Lord. Nice to have on a desk or shelf."
10132,3180,5," Amazing product& it is a perfect item to display on your shelves! I can't wait to get more of these. Also it delivered the next day which was amazing."
10133,3180,3," I really love Funk and what they do and this Voldemort figure is funny yet also loyal to the film portrayal.The only reason I rated this lower is because the Funko box was damaged when I received it and it reduces the appeal quite a lot. If you look at the picture you'll see how the corners of the box were torn. This was around all sides of the box"
10134,3180,3," Its what i wanted but the box its in really bad condition it has been opened before for sure."
10135,3180,5," Great item made the perfect Christmas gift and was delivered promptly"
10136,3180,4," Fast delivery great product although box is damaged"
10137,3180,5," Brought as a present was well received"
10138,3181,5," Product actually arrived 16 days before the predicted delivery date"
10139,3181,2," I would not say that this was a genuine piece as you can see glue that sticks it together and lpoks very cheap also didnt come with any original box"
10140,3181,5," Brilliant! Matches the Joker& and now my partner has the pair :)"
10141,3181,5," Good quality and prompt delivery.  The birthday girl loved it!"
10142,3181,5," My Grandson love this moneybank."
10143,3182,4," My 7 yr old daughter bought this with her birthday money and she is delighted with it. its a bit smaller than I had imagined - no more than 8in tall or long at a guess. It makes horsey noises when she hugs or strokes/grooms it with the brush supplied. It is lvely and soft& appears well made and my daughter takes it absolutely everywhere with her."
10144,3182,5," Received well before it's due date&it was given as a present&the new owner is very pleased with the Animagic Blossom My Beautiful Pony."
10145,3182,5," My 3 year old Daughter has been eyeing this up in tescos for months. Really pleased with this purchase and a very fast delivery!"
10146,3182,4," Small but a lovely pony perfect size for toddlers/pre schoolers to carry round and good sound on it too"
10147,3183,1," Be aware that you will not get the characters in the illustration. There is no BMO and no Jake/Finn merged together& they are replaced with Ice King and another Finn."
10148,3183,5," Great item my little boy is going to love finding these in his stocking this year :)"
10149,3183,5," I absolutely love them amazing Christmas present for my partner"
10150,3183,4," Disappointed it contained two figures of the same character"
10151,3184,5," Can't wait to see my son's face on Christmas Day as he is power rangers mad x"
10152,3184,5," looks like good fun for son for xmas"
10153,3184,5," Perfect for all power ranger fans"
10154,3185,5," Really nice eraser. So tiny just the way I imagined it. Very good purchase. modes4u has lots of different rubbers& I'll buy a lot for my collection."
10155,3186,5," Bought as a gift for nephew who collects these. He loved it."
10156,3187,4," I kind of like this sonic screwdriver& but it wasn't used much when Peter Davison became the Doctor in 1982. This sonic screwdriver was briefly seen in |Castrovalva| where he hands it over to one of his companions whilst he was in a post-regenerative crises& |Kinda| when the Doctor was attaching it onto a new device he created and |The Visitation| where the sonic screwdriver reaches the end of the line of the classic series. It was destroyed because the writers said it was too handy for the Doctor. The next sonic screwdriver model gets seen next in the 1996 Movie (8th Doctor's only adventure).This model is exactly like Tom Baker's (the previous owner) because this one has a white band on the middle& probably to symbolise Peter Davison's."
10157,3187,3," A bit cheaper and nastier looking than I expected (the moulding lines are quite apparent and the paintings not entirely accurate) but it's fun enough. Don't expect anything brilliant and you'll be happy...Ah& Peter D& now there was a Doctor!"
10158,3187,4," I received the sonic screwdriver of the 8th Doctor not the 5th Doctor.But it is really good actually with 3 or 4 different sounds.My daughter love it actually :)"
10159,3187,5," Great item& delivered quickly"
10160,3188,2," Bought this to get additional dino chargers for my sons other power rangers toy so ok for thar but as a stand alone toy 'What is point?''. Doesnt hold together well at all. pointless"
10161,3188,5," this is part of a Christmas present for my nephew he will love it as he is into power rangers."
10162,3188,5," Excellent service and boys love the product"
10163,3188,3," My 6yr old loves these!"
10164,3188,5," THANKS FOR QUICK DELIVERY MY GRANDSON WILL LOVE IT"
10165,3189,5," Amazing I got a bit freaked out when the butterfly started flapping lol but my grandaughter is over the moon with her new pet ðŸ’•ðŸ’‹"
10166,3189,3," My 7 year old daughter really wanted this& she played with it for 2 days and hasnt bothered with it since. very pretty though!"
10167,3189,5," Bought for Xmas. My daughter has been asking for one. Looks fab. This one has sparkling wings. Delivery was quick"
10168,3189,5," Great"
10169,3190,4," Product is excellent. Packaging was excessive  for such a small item.."
10170,3191,3," Great quality but a bit expensive for something so cheap to make"
10171,3191,5," Great fast delivery& good quality products at great prices"
10172,3191,5," It was a present for a fan and she loved it"
10173,3191,5," Excellent"
10174,3192,5," Super cute!!"
10175,3193,5," Fantastic thanks"
10176,3194,5," The Xenoceratops by CollectA has been described as Brilliant by Amazon& I could not disagree specially the extravagant paint work around the head. CollectA disserve a hearty pat on the back for it the mode. It  isn't too small nor too large about 14 cms in length from the tip of the tail to it's beak the quality is excellent and not too costly on obtaining it. So Alien horned face that's what  Xenoceratops means is a little cracker ten of ten."
10177,3195,5," very good just wright"
10178,3195,5," Great quality"
10179,3196,3," Originally ordered and returned due to a small hole in the under belly around the seal.  Was letting air out when you (even gently squeezed) the dinosaur and thus his head was already deflated upon receipt.  Otherwise& a great size and very lifelike.  I had ordered the T-Rex last year and my little boy was overjoyed with it.  No defects there.  Sent the Triceratops back and was swiftly sent a replacement& but it had the same issue!!!  A tiny hole in the seal of the underbelly.  This time not so bad.  The dinosaur had not visibly or to touch deflated anywhere& even though air did escape on gently squeezing.  Decided to keep and glue the hole shut and hopefully that would do the trick........Have now started my Xmas wrapping of presents and pulled out the Triceratops to wrap up and it has visibly deflated. Seems to be a manufacturing issue& as I am sure that if I returned this one a replacement would also be the same."
10180,3196,5," Arrived nicley packaged - I was surprirsed to see a the size of the Triceyit was massive& loveyly quality and fab colour - even thou its soft but is duarable anda child can play with this for hours  great price too.The horns are ot too sharp so its safe to play."
10181,3196,5," This is fab. I have to admit I was worried we would get the green one but we didn't. The price on special offer was brilliant and my son absolutely loves it.I'm not sure i'd pay full price but a present any dinosaur loving child would appreciate."
10182,3196,2," This is quite disappointing. It says that it is stuffed in the title but it is completely hollow! Its also not orange as in the photo& but a kaki green. You don't get your moneys worth at all! Will not be purchasing from these providers again."
10183,3196,5," Omg my son is dinosaur mad!! He plays with them at nursery aswell as they have a designated dinosaur corner and 9/10 this is where he can be found when I collect him and it was on one of these days that I noticed the nursery had these huge dinasaurs and I asked my son if he like them and indeed he did& I first of all went to smyths as this is were the nursery purchased them but the were 16.99!!! No way was I paying that as I wanted to get him a few so off I went on my search through Google and I found them on Amazon at an amazing price so bought 4 and out them away for Christmas and my son was absolutely thrilled Christmas morning and has played with them ever since!these ar really huge and soft I think the are filled with air"
10184,3196,5," Good sized toy& just right for a dinosaur-crazy toddler to hug. Soft enough to be safely squidgy - and I say this as much from self-protection as from parental concern& having been 'clocked' by any number of items my son has had in his hands! Sturdy enough to stand and be stood on. Great toy."
10185,3196,5," fantastic& my two year old loves& it huge and squashy and great& also got two t rexs for my two and five year old in this range to and just as good& amazing price for the size and quality. highly recommend for any little dinosaur fan!"
10186,3196,5," These are amazing& large"
10187,3197,5," great to play with and add to our grandsons collection"
10188,3198,1," Waste of money& this and the other carriages that attach to the dinosaur train. My advice?? Do yourself a favor and avoid. Might seem cheap enough but when you buy the other add ons works out over forty pounds. Plus it is tiny& not worth it."
10189,3198,4," Trains are bigger than I expected (though small). One star less because the figure comes unstuck too easily from the car (which annoyed the kid). There is a little peg on the car floor on which one foot sticks."
10190,3198,3," The Figurines do not stand up and definitely never hold up on the train otherwise nice enough. Toddler likes it"
10191,3198,5," My grandson loves the Dinosaur collection so am adding to it for Christmas pressies. I know he will love it."
10192,3198,5," THIS PRODUCT WAS BOUGHT AS PART OF A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR A 3YR OLD LITTLE BOY& HE ABSOLUTLEY LOVED IT"
10193,3199,5," I bought these for my 13 month old grandson as he loves playing with the magnets on the fridge. These are great because the entire back is a magnet...not like the tiny little circles that are normally on the back of magnets. So these are really safe for children. I also ordered the the animal box of these. I ordered the week before christmas and i didn't think they would arrive before Christmas but they did...which i was really pleased with."
10194,3199,5," my grandaughter loves these&She is 2 and a half and spends hours with these pre historic friends. This has definately created a genuine interest in animals for her and she asks about them constantly.Good quality time spent with traditional toys is great."
10195,3199,4," A nice selection of brightly coloured dinosaur magnets that my young son loved. They are well made and durable and therefore offer good value for money as they will last a lot longer than cheaper products. My only tiny improvement would be that they come in a handy wooden box and a proper lid to the box would be great for transporting them where as currently there is merely a plastic cover& that aside though& a good product."
10196,3199,4," Nice& my son loves them& but he loves most dinosaurs.  The picture is paper and its already come off one though."
10197,3199,4," Came very fast my boys do love these but can't say quality is excellent as one is already chopped and to say I have watched them with them putting them on the fridge and taken them off one is already chipped other wise very good as my boys love them"
10198,3199,4," Good value for money - you get a lot of them and well made.Only issue is they dont hold anything on boards/fridge - so great for kids to play with but they fall off easily and wont hold the little ones |art| up."
10199,3199,5," My children are dinosaur mad and these are very well made& and very bright and colourful.  The magnet area is very large and they stick well."
10200,3199,5," Bright& colourful and strong magnets. Good quality and the perfect size for little hands. We're very pleased with our little dinosaurs."
10201,3200,4," We have just been given this pteranadon for my son's 4th birthday.  It joins his playmobil T-rex and Triceratops sets.  I would recommend all of them - we love playmobil and dinosaurs.This item is durable and fun - by pressing the head you can open and close it's beak so it can swoop down and catch the fish (included) from the water."
10202,3200,5," Everything ok& this toy was for my son who collects the dinossaurs from playmobil and I couldn't find it in my country. He is happy and plays all the time with it."
10203,3200,4," Got this to go with the volcano set. Great size for little hands. A bit fiddly to sit him on the tree& but to be honest he's usually being flown around the lounge"
10204,3200,5," The 4173 Pteranodon is not available in the Netherlands (january 2011)& that's why I bought it in the U.K. for my son& who adores Playmobil.Just like any other Playmobil& it's big fun and durable."
10205,3201,3," If you want a big dinosaur& go for the Brachiosaur... this thing is the same price& but TINY ! A good build& awkwardly positioned (looking over his shoulder) spindly tail... did I mention the Brachiosaur?"
10206,3201,5," Excellent sculpt"
10207,3201,4," When I reviewed the Papo Brachiosaurus model I said wouldn't it be wonderful if they did some more of the sauropods and mentioned the Apatosaurus! well here it is!!!!!! and again it's a wonderful model but slightly smaller than expected if all the models are to scale (probably watched to much walking with dinosaurs where they really went for the massive)."
10208,3202,5," great gift"
10209,3203,5," Lovely vase brilliant quality"
10210,3204,5," I purchased this Schleich Brachiosaurus for my nephew. I have purchased Schleich figures before for my nephew as well as for my own son and while they are quite expensive& the detail in the figures is excellent and they are very solid. I purchased this on sale for 8.99 and was shocked when it arrived how big it was. I had thought with the price it may be a baby& but definitely was not! It is in scale with the other Schleich dinosaurs and excellent quality. It is expensive on its own& but I feel well worth it. They are great for play or display and they have an excellent resale value on ebay as they are collectable. I would highly recommend the Schleich figures if you are looking for detailed robust figures of animals as they have an excellent variety."
10211,3204,5," The kids love them& they are well made and seem very sturdy& they throw them about and bash them into each other and none of the paint has come off."
10212,3204,5," Bought this for my sons 8th birthday as he has become dinosaur mad. A lovely good value toy that was well packaged and arrived very fast :)"
10213,3204,4," My 3 year old son loves this! It's really realistic and worth the money. I'd recommend this to anyone who's kids loves dinosaurs."
10214,3204,5," lovely little toy this& hardy and the paint doesn't come off in water& which is brilliant as our boys like to take their dinosaurs into the bath with them. It's quite small& if you want a large one& choose the big dark brown Schleich Brachiosaurus which is double the price& double the size and about 4 times as heavy. This one we call 'baby brachiosaurus'"
10215,3204,4," The brachiosaurus was exactly as I expected. Schleich models are always extremely good quality and this was no exception. My one quibble is that this was described as a playset - which indicates to me that there is more than one item. There was only one item therefore the description is false."
10216,3204,5," Bought for my sons third birthday& he adores dinosaurs. These Schleich playset dinosaurs are surprisingly good& they look good&  well made& solid& robust& toddler proof. He spends so much time playing with his dinos& inside/ outside & they go everywhere - even to bed with him and in the bath."
10217,3204,5," Got this 'Brachi' for my three year old nephew who is extraordinarily clued up on his Dinos! He loved it and even takes it into the Bathtub! It's really nice quality& bigger than I expected with lovely detail. Worth it I think â˜º"
10218,3205,5," This is an amazing toy. Got this for my son (2yr 10m) for Christmas and he loves it still. In fact on Christmas day it was the first present he opened and he just wanted to play with it and not open his other presents. It is fairly easy to control& turning is the hardest but only takes a little practice& the best bit is changing from a car into a dinosaur (or back). I was concerned the batteries wouldn't last long but after 2 months and 2/3 plays a week we are still on the same ones we put in at Christmas"
10219,3205,4," Grandson so pleased with this present&he loves dinosaurs and plays with this a lot.He is 5years old&would recommend this for that age."
10220,3205,5," My 6 year old loves this&one of the best toys that he's ever been given.easy to operate"
10221,3205,5," Bought this for my Grandson for Christmas and he was very pleased with it so would recommend for any Transformer fans out there."
10222,3205,5," Both my boys love this.  It arrived today super quick!Now I just have to put up with the screaming and fighting over who gets to play with it next!Great toy and discounted to just Â£20."
10223,3205,5," The kids love it! Good rc car and then the transforming to dino is amazing! And really well made& feels solid. Good buy."
10224,3205,4," My son really enjoys this toy& especially the smooth transformation.  However the batteries run out very quickly."
10225,3205,5," Kids loved it& easy to use& goes quite fast too very good for young kids. Delivery was quick too"
10226,3206,2," Papo Pachyrhinosaurus is not accurate the model lets itself considerably by the anklers on the frill& if you look at pictures or fossils of this dinosaur you will notice it never had these at all& so papo who usually produce good  models of dinosaurs have let themselves down with the frill area and the paint work is the standard papo grey seen on many of the dinosaurs they produce my advice is to leave this one well alone. So If you are after a Pachyrhinosaurus then look for the Wild Safari produced one like I have done& it's more accurate than this thank you."
10227,3206,4," Excellent Model my Grandson loved it - well made with excellent details"
10228,3206,5," Smaller than expected but good quality product"
10229,3206,5," PachyrhinosaurusA great success.  I found an old box and converted it into a cage.  The three year old recipient was over the moon.  This is the perfect gift for any serious collector - of any age."
10230,3206,5," My three year old is completely obsessed with dinosaurs and I think I have bought Amazon's entire stock over the last 6 months or so. Good quality and size. My son loves it!"
10231,3206,5," good addition to my Grandsons collection"
10232,3207,5," I grew up with the Toy Story franchise& so when I heard of this line of replicas I just had to get a collection going (though admittedly a bit old for it). I love the Woody I got so i decided to get Bullseye next. It arrived in good time and in good condition. The box colours were a tiny bit faded (perhaps from daytime display)& but I'm happy about that& it added to the charm. Really soft but sturdy material& very well made and doesn't seem to be any way as fragile as some of the other characters in the series. The batteries are also a lot easier to get to.The sounds are quite a cool feature also& and his hooves are plastic so if you shake him& he even sounds like he's galloping when he's turned off. I think the price is very fair also& I thought at first that it was expensive but for the quality of this product& it's a steal.The one thing that is not so much a criticism as a 'heads-up'& The stand that comes with Bullseye is kinda hard to get him balanced at 1st& but after a while you will find the comfortable spot. I would recommend closing windows and such when he's on the stand as a gust of wind may knock him off.This toy is probably the furthest thing from what I would have played with as a young kid& but I love it! It's a beautiful and adorable piece of work.  I recommend this to every Toy Story fan and fans of that classic Disney character look."
10233,3207,5," Great replica Woody's Horse Bullseye from the Toy Story movie in actual movie size. Includes display stand and certificate of authenticity. Over 10 horse sound and music! Plus interactive galloping sounds with vibration! My son Jirka is very very happy!!!"
10234,3207,5," I purchased this away from Amazon& but purely because I found it on sale at another large online toy retailer. This is for my 4 year old son who loves the films and also got a Woody and a Buzz Lighyear at the same time. My older son had one of these several years ago and I was impressed at the time (but when it first came out it was around Â£100!). Bullseye works well with the large scale dolls /action figures and is to scale with most large Woody / Jessie dolls I have seen. They do sit well on bullseye. Bullseye doesn't stand on his own& but comes with a stand that does hold him well. It also comes with a button you can attach to his battery pack so you can push a button to get sound rather than pressing on his saddle& this button is attached to the main box when you get it so you can try it without opening the box. There isn't nearly the variety in sounds in Bullseye in comparison to Woody& Buzz"
10235,3207,3," I got my Bullseye today after waiting to see if the price would go down. The toy is very well made and I love the attention to detail but the only problem it the stand. The poles that bullseye rests on are very unstable and don't fit the holes on the base very well. Fortunatly a dab of superglue seems to have fixed it.Overall I like bullseye and look forward to getting Jessie as well. ( the price for jessie HAS been going down so don't rush to buy her)"
10236,3207,4," Fab toy! My daughter loves her bullseye& lovely design& noises and durable....she still adores it after 4 months which is a record for us!"
10237,3207,5," Amazing toy for my lil girl& sadly under my weight the legs collapse and it doesn't go anywhere. Great size for my girl tho"
10238,3207,5," WOW WOW WOW!!! Bullseye is fantastic. We have been looking for one for a while so very pleased to get one. I thought he was a little expensive but he looks much better than expected"
10239,3207,5," Our son is 4 years old and a toystory fan. Seen the Toystory 3 movie twice already. Hasn't stop playing with Bullseye since bought for his birthday. Bullseye is technically clever and  endearing. Mainly made of cloth so flexible and spongeable. Horse sounds are realistic and dont get on nerves when heard over and over. Has a stand so he can be displayed  easily when not in use. Isn't modern toy technology wonderful!"
10240,3208,5," Great gift at a good price. Arrived well packaged."
10241,3208,5," FAB. Grandchild loved it."
10242,3208,5," very good and looks hardy"
10243,3209,5," Ah& this is so adorable! I love Gackt and Gakupo so I knew I had to get this :) the delivery was really fast& it took around 2 weeks to get to me. And it's just so perfect. Came it good condition too& I recommend this!"
10244,3209,5," he is super cute and looks even better in person! he came really quickly to considering that it was shipped from osaka."
10245,3209,4," Had a broken strand of hair but I'll be forgiving because its a thin piece of plastic"
10246,3209,5," Excellent nendoroid!"
10247,3209,5," Brilliant"
10248,3210,3," Not an especially detailed model. The head& flippers and tail feel quite insubstantial and the paintwork is minimal& but this mosasaur has a discreet charm that reminds me of old Victorian reconstructions.It's good to see more obscure prehistoric reptiles represented in toy form& and this is a basic but still pleasing example."
10249,3210,5," This was purchased for my dinosaur mad 4 year old son who loves it. Really not a bad purchase for the price and so would recommend."
10250,3211,4," I have a dinosaur mad 7 year old.  He already has a couple of spinosauri (I think that's the correct plural version lol) but wanted one with a moveable jaw.  This one has a moveable jaw& but disappointingly plain skin colours.  It looks rather greying and boring (like we used to think dinosaurs look like) when you unwrap it.However& having said that& it has the normal high quality skin markings and so on that Schleich dinosaurs normally have (I rarely buy anything else for my son).Because of the disappointingly dull skin colours& I have only given this one 4 stars as opposed to the normal 5 I'd give."
10251,3211,3," It arrived and it is okay& doesn't annoy me enough to send it back. The replacement would probably be just as undefined and not as good as the sales image. Schleich should be more accurate with there promotional images. I've uploaded a 'customer image' to show accurate bland colouring."
10252,3211,2," Schleich are well made but the markings and colouring are much duller making it look very different  when recieved (the picture is misleading). My son was very disappointed on his birthday as he particular wanted what he saw in the picture."
10253,3211,4," Slightly smaller than we expected. The quality and detail are& as usual with Schleich& very good. Recommendable if you have children with dinosaur obsessions."
10254,3211,5," A strong durable toy with excellent moving mouth so lots of roaring can be done.  Water proof& dirt proof and child proof.  Hours of fun been had"
10255,3211,5," dino details is awesome. just like having a miniature jurassic park! this is highly recommended for dino enthusiast. schleich are the best!"
10256,3211,5," Expensive for what it is in reality but a great item and will last a long time even with am active and heavy handed child :)"
10257,3211,5," My 2 and a half year old Grandson loves it. He picked it& along with nearly all the other Schleich animals he owns."
10258,3212,5," Very happy with product. Good quality. Only downside is would have been great if dinosaurs came with names for educational reasons....my son has enjoyed playing with them so one happy customer."
10259,3212,5," These arrived quickly and my granddaughter finds them to be colourful and entertaining& She loves playing with them and inventing names for them."
10260,3212,5," Nice to have something a little different in dino types. Good colours and nice quality. Have been used a lot."
10261,3213,5," large But very realistic."
10262,3214,5," This guy has to fight lions &cowboys&the hulk&spiderman and a t-rex.Not sure who will win but its usually the hulk or t-rex.Great figure with great detail."
10263,3214,5," all the figures from Bullyland were fantastic quality with attention to detail.  My Grandson loved all the figures and they enhanced the pleasure of his fort"
10264,3214,4," too small"
10265,3215,5," Fantastic quality as always with Playmobil.  Plus it comes in a very big box which kids love.  Bought it for just under Â£20 so a real bargain."
10266,3215,5," My grandson loved this set which we bought for his Birthday. Lovely quality&  as with all  Playmobil  products and nice attention to detail."
10267,3215,5," This item was purchased as a birthday present and was excellent value compared to high street prices.  delivery was excellent and arrived on time for the birthday."
10268,3215,5," Loads of detail& well constructed as usual with playmobil& and sparked off lots of question and discussion with my son."
10269,3215,5," My 6 year old boy has various Playmobil sets and this one is great. It forms an outlying camp that gets the focus every now and then. The different characters are great for jusing in different ways - whether it's just the camp itself or the wolf making friends with another set of characters or.... it's very good."
10270,3215,4," Bought this to go with the western fort for my son& always find Playmobil to be of excellent quality and stays together with some tough play but I did find this harder to assemble than other products& the teepee was frustrating and my son gave up leaving me to my own devices but once put together it lasts& thankfully!"
10271,3215,5," My son loves his Playmobil pirate sets and this is just as good in every way - fantastic quality and remarkable detail in the constituent parts. The teepee takes quite a bit of putting together but this is because of the good design and durability. We're very happy indeed and don't have any doubts about its longevity."
10272,3215,5," So well made& and kept my nephew busy for hours building this up.  There are lots of little bits& so not great if there are also small kids around& but I would highly recommend this product otherwise.  The quality was fantastic."
10273,3216,5," My granson loved it. Sturdily made for little hands and simple to manipulate."
10274,3216,4," Great toy for under 5s& son was fascinated with the car-dino combination."
10275,3216,5," I bought this for my 4 year old nephew. It was smaller than I expected from the picture but it made a roaring sound which I did not expect. He loves it and has played with it constantly since he has got it. Great for kids with imagination.The seller was super fast and the item perfectly wrapped."
10276,3216,5," Great product it has amused my grandchild for hours over Christmas."
10277,3216,5," Like all the others in this range&changes into something and is a dinosaur&having not seen it have to relay on my nephew and he likes it"
10278,3216,2," Very cheap and nasty plastic. Broke quite quickly but barely played with."
10279,3216,5," Got this for my son for xmas think he wil lv it"
10280,3216,4," Smaller than it looks but my son loves it!"
10281,3217,4," Not a bad little T rex this model. It does come fixed to a stand though. Be great to use on a model Jurassic scene !"
10282,3217,4," great figure with a nice pose."
10283,3217,5," Great products."
10284,3217,5," Hi is this a model kit that U can put to giver and paint"
10285,3218,5," Exactly what I ordered and arrived with great speed and in brilliant condition so that I could add it to my collection of Milky Holmes."
10286,3219,4," I bought this for my 5 year old son along with two other dragons& some knights and a castle. It is a beautiful dragon and works well with Schleich knights and Melissa"
10287,3220,4," The varying quality of Safari dino's is quite baffling (my recently purchased Cryolophosaurus is a good model ruined by a horrid paintjob) but this Dilophosaurus is a beauty. The legs look a little chicken-like but that's nitpicking. The rest of the sculpt is great and the paint is exquisite. Top stuff& Safari!"
10288,3220,4," in general& a very good appearance"
10289,3220,5," received as promised. Looks very nice.Quality is very good.You can purchase it too. Worth attention. Thank you so much."
10290,3221,5," Bought specially at my son's request.He loves this range of historical figures.Quite expensive& I'd have said&but they just never& ever break and they are large enough not to mysteriously disappear in to nowhere.Recommend this seller certainly.Quick and efficient."
10291,3222,5," My 4 year old loves this toy& especially the drill. Easy to take apart and re-assemble and great that it combines with other zords."
10292,3222,5," Arrived in good time& well packaged and as descibed - My son loves it ! Thank you"
10293,3223,5," My dinosaur crazy son asked Santa for this and was not disappointed."
10294,3224,5," our 9 year old son loves playing with this figure& it is very realistic and good quality& but you need to play carefully as some parts could break quite easily."
10295,3224,4," exactly as described - very satisfied"
10296,3225,5," Excellent"
10297,3226,5," excellent  quality item& well made and fits the Tiana (and other dolls) well& only downside is that they dont fit in with the magiclip dolls&"
10298,3227,5," An Official Sonic Nendoroid from the Good Smile Company and it is glorious.The paint job is fantastic& the plastic feels good to the touch and the accessories are the best compared to every other Sonic Figure ever.This is a display piece figure for posing and showing off. Not for playing with& as it is quite delicate. However this is what I bought it for so I am very happy."
10299,3227,5," Fantastic product and a great delivery service. My son loves this and has added this to his vast collection of Sonic products. A nice letter also from the supplier. Thank you."
10300,3227,5," This is a perfect edition to any collector who loves Sonic. After careful analysis I can confirm this is not a knockoff& the paint job is phenomenal& the figure has  one minor issue and that is on one of the faces there's a little blue smudge& that's probably just bad luck of my part and not the sellers fault.A great deal and the seller was very helpful& sending me e-mails when it was dispatched etc..."
10301,3227,5," I purchased the Sonic Nendoroid figure as a gift for my partner who adores all things Sonic related (I haven't given it to him yet and he doesn't know about it!)I have checked over the figure (without removing it from it's packaging) to ensure that it is a real Nendoroid figure - and by my investigation it is indeed!! I'm incredibly pleased and I can't wait to see my partner's face when I give this wonderful figure to him!I've read in other reviews for this product that the limbs fall out etc - this is not a toy& it's a posable figure for display so will most likely not suit those who are planning on 'playing' with it a lot. My partner and I are currently setting up a display cabinet to show off our varied collections of game memorabilia& so this figure is ideal for us.I hope this review helps."
10302,3227,1," Very disappointed. A ridiculous amount of money to begin with& but it was one of the things my son wanted most for Christmas so I bought it. Within a day& the hand had snapped off.  My son is ten and treats his characters with the utmost care& so I can imagine how many minutes it would take a younger or less careful child to completely trash it. A complete waste of money."
10303,3228,4," i recently purchased a copy of this model kit for a necron army i& i actual got 3 at once.the unit is fairly decent& i cannot be upgraded but has a fairly good punch and a lot of sustainability there weapons with so many shots mean the they have a good chance against any other troop choice but and kill always damage tanks on a 6 meaning these guys can punch far above there points cost& they can have a cryptec or necron lord join them to increase there effectiveness but this is not always unnecessaryas for the models themselves they are fairly well detailed and had no noticeable defects&i actually bought my third pack of these guys to convert into cryptecs with parts from other necron kitsim all it was a fairly decent buy at a very reasonable price"
10304,3228,5," I've been doing war hammer for a long time if you get 3 at a time work on one box say a time and remember how you mix the colours not like me when I 1st started lol"
10305,3228,5," for your own sanity don't buy 3 boxes in one go ... who knew that war in the 41st millennium would be so .. tedious !?!"
10306,3229,5," Bought this for my 4 year old son and its great. I have not given the toy to my son as yet as its a surprise when we go to Butlins next week but I am def pleased with it. Lovely colour and great detail to it."
10307,3229,4," What's most impressive is how many prehistoric creatures can be bought in replica& even the lesser known ones like this. My son likes it very much"
10308,3230,5," ALL GOOD THANK YOU"
10309,3231,5," My grandson of 2 loves these always playing with them"
10310,3231,5," Very good children loved them"
10311,3232,4," My 4 year old has a lot of other Playmobil dinosaurs and was missing this one from his collection. The size of this dinosaur is small in comparison to the Playmobil triceratops and stegosaurus as the dimetrodon was a smaller dinosaur in its time. The length of the dimetrodon is 17cm and the height is 9cm. The sail (spine) down its back is made from flexible rubber. There are lots of little pieces that come with this dinosaur including a snake& a scorpion& a dragonfly& and a flying lizard. It also comes with a pool of water that you have to assemble by simply clicking together the blue plastic imitation water to the green pool surrounding and then adding the vegetation. There are some very small pieces with this set so if the person that you are buying this set for has a baby brother or sister please beware."
10312,3232,5," We're dinosaur& and Playmobil crazy in our house so this was an essential addition to our collection when we purchased it for our five year old son. This is one of the smaller sets in the Playmobil range and features a Dimetrodon (it all works well with the scale of the Playmobil sets which are all at the same scale so it's smaller than the other dinosaurs because Dimetrodon was smaller). The set arrives with a range of accessories including a snake& flying lizard& butterfly and dragonfly. You also receive a water pool and vegetation which you will need to construct prior to play.Some of the pieces are rather small so it's important to make sure that you have good storage for the toy when it's been unboxed. The Playmobil boxes don't reseal so these don't work in that way for us. It's also important to keep the smaller pieces away from younger siblings who might be tempted to put them in their mouths.My son has been delighted with this set and he can be found playing with his collection often. I'd really recommend it for dinosaur and Playmobil fans."
10313,3232,4," Bought for my 3 year old son. He loves it. The accessories were a little fiddly to put together and one part doesn't fit snugly. Overall good quality."
10314,3232,5," This was purchased for my 3 year old son for Christmas together with the Dinos Stegosaurus Playmobil set& and my son loves it.  It's a great set with loads of little bits& baby dinosaurs& greenery& head moving dinosaur& he spends hours playing with both sets and the Playmobil Knights set& for instance the knights have been attacked by the dinosaurs for stealing the babies!  The only very minor bugbear is that some of the pieces are tiny and easily get misplaced& but that should by no means put you off purchasing the set."
10315,3232,4," I have a mad playmobil fan!!! This was great! Its not large but there is plenty of parts and adds perfectly on with the other dino range!!!"
10316,3232,4," Just right for a four year old's birthday& sturd - even the tiny pieces& really well detailed& great for imagative play"
10317,3232,5," We are so happy with this product. We got it at a bargain price so feel it was excellent value and our 2 year old daughter loves it. She had never heard of a dimetrodon before& however he is her new favourite"
10318,3232,5," I bought this for my god-daughter's birthday - aged 5. Great quality& and lots of really interesting little pieces inside. The tree is on a hinge...so it can stand up or fall over...what fun!"
10319,3233,4," Problem as there were no instructions."
10320,3234,2," I'm so disappointed with this toy. We really wanted to like Patchi and add him to our growing dinosaur collection unfortunately"
10321,3234,5," Arrived on time& well packaged& well made. I bought one for a birthday present& then my some wanted his own& so I was happy to buy another one as it appeared to be great quality and is his current favourite dinosaur."
10322,3234,5," as expected and my grandson loved it& the sound is very good& very well made would recommend to a friend"
10323,3234,2," very disappointed small and roars not talk for the price rip off"
10324,3234,5," My son loves this he loves the film so was very pleased with it"
10325,3234,5," brilliant follow on for dvd  Walking with Dinosaurs good model"
10326,3235,5," just what was requested I think. it is a present so don't know the outcome."
10327,3236,5," This is a superb model of Allosaurus. I couldn't find much information about it prior to purchase& and I was cautious given how difficult it is to procure in the UK& never mind the high associated costs..! However& as a discerning dinosaur collector& I'm extremely glad I took the plunge! This is a very large and commanding model (see pic) but is very lightweight because it is hollow. It is not as soft as the title suggests& and will not easily yield to a squeeze. The artists have paid great attention to detail and by eye& the anatomy seems to fit skeletal restorations quite well. The hip height is roughly four times the length of the feet& which is a yardstick used by ichnologists to determine the size and speed of a dinosaur& and therefore gives this model further scientific credentials. Also& the palate of the beautifully detailed mouth is more bird-like than mammal-like& another neat touch which shows the attention that the artist has paid to making this model as accurate as possible. The fenestra of the skull are not overly emphasised which is very refreshing& and the head is nicely and realistically detailed in an almost crocodilian way. The sculpted scutes on the back of the torso are also crocodile-like and reflect artistic license& and the textures of the skin& from the convincing folds to the pebbly texture on the flanks and the musculature in the thighs is all very effective. Of course& as a (distant) relative of birds it is entirely possible that Allosaurus had a fuzzy integument at least in part& but as there is no evidence of that at present it is perfectly acceptable for the artists to take inspiration from dinosaurs' other relatives& the crocodilians. These models are beautifully hand-painted& which is obvious on mine as a thumb print on the sole of the right foot.Read more â€º"
10328,3237,5," One of the most detailed children's toys I've ever found for my son (the budding 5yr old paleontologist).  Well made with excellent features.  I'm definitely going to get more from this manufacturer if this is the standard they produce their toys."
10329,3237,5," nice model"
10330,3238,5," Bought this baby T-rex to accompany two adult t-rexs for my 5yr old nephew. Great detail and really well made...it even has a moving jaw just like the larger adult t-rexs& lovely."
10331,3238,5," I have always been loyal to Schleich& but when it came to dinosaurs& I felt that they were lacking in detail and quality compared to their other products.I am a massive Dino fan and initially bought the brown adult T-rex& but I loved it so much& I just had to complete the family.The detail on this little chap is exquisite (just like Mummy) and I love the fact that you can open and close his mouth - and these joints never look obvious.Very durable toy and I'm sure others will love him as much as I do. x"
10332,3238,5," Excellent quality and detailed as to be expected from Papo toys. Very realistic& daughter loves them!"
10333,3239,5," My grandson was delighted with these dinosaurs.It was a prompt delivery service and product was as described.I would recommend to any dinosaur fan"
10334,3239,5," Present for my granddaughter who just loved this. Any dino addict will be pleased. Although they are quite small they are in scale with the Brachiosaurus also bought."
10335,3239,5," Bought this along with a few smaller sets for my 7yr is at Xmas& always find playmobil great value and my son enjoys this much more than Lego. Highly recommended ðŸ‘"
10336,3239,4," Accurate description..although a big box for relatively few pieces. I was hoping the dino`s would be a little bigger& but pleased all the same."
10337,3239,5," I bought this toy for my four year old grandson for Christmas. He loved it and I'm sure will have lots of fun playing with it."
10338,3239,5," My niece loved this set.  She is only six and a big Dinosaur fan.Usual Playmobil quality and excellent Amazon service."
10339,3239,5," Got this for granddaughter Christmas present and we were not disappointedGood and sturdy. Good size and easy to build"
10340,3239,5," As expected it is well made Playmobil quality and my grandson loves playing with it& what more is there to say."
10341,3240,5," The little one loves this and knew his name straight away so is a good likeness. Quick fast delivery so we are all very happy - thank you."
10342,3240,3," Mapusaurus by Collecta& does yours fall down a lot? Mine does& it's also under scale it's been reported that tis was bigger than Tyrannosaurs Rex& So how come this model is a weedy cheap poor quality and no one else has done a better model of this I'll get rid of mine when a good decent Mapusaurus released by somebody. And why do they call it a Mapusaurus surely dinosaurs didn't use maps did they I couldn't resist that!"
10343,3241,5," Bought as xmas pressie for son who is almost 4yrs old........ loves it as does 19mtv old. Seems very good quality as not broken yet! Delivery good too"
10344,3241,5," Very sturdy& well made toy my .grandson loves it.  I would recommend it to all super hero fans.Good value for money."
10345,3241,5," figure was sturdy and a decent size. 5 year old boy loved it& plus accessories were good too. Good price"
10346,3241,5," Bought this figure for my grandson's Christmas and I know he will love it because it is a proper quality figure and looks exactly like Batman should. Appears to be solid and sturdy and should last the passage of time. Glad I purchased it."
10347,3241,5," This is a great figure& as I've been disappointed in the past with rather small action figures that were very expensive.  Good value"
10348,3241,5," I bought it for my 4yr old son& the size is very good! Sturdy and the gun is an extra bonus. I would recommend it!"
10349,3241,4," my 4 year old grandson really liked this batman and his weapons were fun-and it was reasonable value for money."
10350,3242,5," Service great 2 year old  grandson very happy"
10351,3243,4," Set of 7 very small plastic dinosaur figures in the Megasaurus series. There are other dinosaur figures to collect plus farm and zoo animals. The box is a nice addition. The inner box slips out and has a painted background children can use as a small stage for their creatures to play on.These little figures are a firm favourite in our house. They last a long time and are very durable for their size& I haven't experienced any of the heads& feet or tails snapping off& they're nicely painted and quite realistic. We have a few different sets.Watch out when you open the box. The figures are held tightly upright by a host of tiny plastic tabs and wire - takes ages to untie them."
10352,3243,5," I was very pleased with this set of model dinosaurs when they arrived. They are bigger than I expected& beautifully modelled& but at the same time they look like they will stand up well to being played with.I haven't had any feed back yet from the young man I bought them for but I certainly thought they were great.I also bought a dinosaur sticker book from Amazon to go with them to add to the educational value."
10353,3243,1," Dinosaurs are realistic but made from very hard plastic& so accidents might occur. The main problem: 2 of them faulty& not being able to stand. I tried to adjust their balance by slightly bending their legs or tails but without success. I won't recommend them and I won't buy them again."
10354,3243,5," This set was really good& the only thing I can can complain about is the excessive strapping down of these& you need a very sharp knife to get them off the box& and a screw driver which is annoying. But apart from that my son loved them& he really enjoyed playing with the."
10355,3243,5," i have bought a few dinosaurs for my son xmas this is by far one of the better ones& purchased walking with dinosaurs for double the price half the size. would defo recommend these they are small but for what they are defo worth the money."
10356,3243,5," Purchased as a Secret Santa gift for works kids event.  Everything looks fine packaging wise.  Not sure about items as I don't have children myself but for other staff members kids so am sure that they will have a better idea once opened."
10357,3243,5," Grandson loved this birthday gift& good value and nice and sturdy. Good sizes range from 3-4 5-6 inches some smaller but good  variety."
10358,3243,4," These are very good little dinosaur models. Ideal for little 3 or 4 year olds. Robustly made - look good for the cost."
10359,3244,4," very fast service one day good models& but beware if you are a collector this set is not scaled to the individual pieces also on offer& these are slightly smaller."
10360,3244,5," My son loves them. Although very delicate toys."
10361,3244,5," very nice item"
10362,3244,5," Good"
10363,3245,5," That's what my daughter said about it. She also gave it 5 stars. I bought it as a present for her 6th birthday as she is very interested in dinosaurs. She really likes the dinosaur eggs that open to reveal baby stegosauruses and much fun was had fending off the evil lizard who was trying to eat them. She's not a girly girl (hates pink& princesses and fairies) so I was pleased to see a dinosaur related toy that is maybe aimed more at girls than boys& although her brother plays with it too. It's just a shame I had to pay for it to be shipped from Germany because it's not available here"
10364,3245,5," I ordered this for my son's birthday.  Unfortunately it didn't arrive by the latest dispatch date but I contacted the seller and they responded very quickly and got another one sent to me first class so I still received it on the day of my son's birthday.  It is a lovely set and he loves the fact that the eggs open to reveal little baby stegosaurus's.Thank you for a great customer service."
10365,3245,5," My granddaughter just loves dinosaurs and when she received this as part of her Christmas everything else was put to the side to play with these. She loves them and seem to be well made and she plays happily with them. They are just the right size for her not babyish looking&so really pleased with the purchase."
10366,3245,4," Great toy& my son loves it and played with it for hours on the day it arrived.  Just wish the base was stuck together rather than having to pick up two separate pieces when my son transports it around the house.  We already have another Playmobil dinosaur and plan to buy more from the set."
10367,3245,5," I was very pleased with this dinosaur set as my eldest loved dinosaurs and wanted her little sister to have dinosuars but she is a girly girl our playmobil is fairies& castles etc but she loved this especially helping to look after the eggs and babies. I would highly recommend this."
10368,3245,5," Really pleased with this item brought for my nephew for his 5th birthday. Very easy and quick to put together and all items are very well made. Colours are bright and eye catching. Would definitely recommend this item and other playmobil dinos products!"
10369,3245,5," Our daughter is obsessed with dinosaurs& and has a lot of Playmobil stuff anyway& so we were disappointed to see that their dinosaur range had seemingly been withdrawn last year.  However& they were just getting a new range organised& clearly:) Love this stegosaurus set - the plants and dragonflies are a lovely touch& and the dinosaur itself is the usual fantastic quality from Playmobil.  Being able to put the baby dinosaurs into their eggs is also a lovely idea."
10370,3245,3," Bought this as a gift but found some of the pieces very small for a four year old. It needed an adult to put some pieces together. The dinosaur on it's own was a good size. The eggs will get lost easily."
10371,3246,5," The dinosaurs are very accurate to look at.They are also extremely strong& they have been parachuted out of helicopters without a parachute and not been damaged.The colours we thought were imaginative!The uses for them as small world toys are huge. Our child has used them in conjunction with many other favourite toys& even as helping dinosaurs to Fireman Sam.In essence the dinosaurs were excellent value for money as they are still unscratched& dented or damaged and have been used continuously by a very active and physical two year old flinging them around!The only criticism is that we have not found others in the same range."
10372,3246,5," Bought for a friend who's son is mad about dinosaurs and he loves them& especially the Pteranodon.There's 8 colourful creatures inside from the largest the Diplodocus to the flying reptile Pteranodon"
10373,3246,5," I bought this for my 4 year old godson and he's been carrying them all around for days.The toys are bigger than I expected and really sturdy. They have the names of the dinosaurs on the bottom of each one& and the box even has extra info on each one that you can cut out and keep.This is a great product& I was really impressed."
10374,3246,5," Bought this for my 5yr old grandsons birthday& who's mad on dinosaurs& he absolutely loves it...says it was his favorite present and takes it everywhere with him...the pieces are very detailed and sturdy..very pleased with this purchase."
10375,3246,4," Our 3 year old loves these.They're hard wearing and a nice group.We'd have loved a little more educational info which we had to get from the internet."
10376,3247,5," All the papo figures are amazing my 9yr old son loves them and we can only get some of them on amazon . So thank you amazon for making my life easier ."
10377,3248,4," Another beautiful addition to Sentai/Power Rangers S.H. Figuarts line& Bouken/Operation Overdrive Red in all his fiery glory.Ok some maybe put off due to the gap issues in the paint but don't let it& if you collect Figuarts then you know exactly what to expect from him. He has all the articulation and accessories you could want (including some for a certain Unofficial Sentai).If you collect Sentai Figuarts or just a fan of this Fiery Adventurer you need to have this guy in your collection."
10378,3248,4," cool figure. right shoulder's a bit loose on mine but& if you're a fan of power rangers / super sentai& you probably wanna buy this."
10379,3249,5," While it might look expensive& for what you get this is surprisingly excellent value. The Giganotosaurus lives up to its name and towers over every other dinosaur in my four-year-old son's collection. It's big in a way that defines bigness. The wee 1/48th scale man (a nice touch) that comes with it is 1.5 inches tall& and barely reaches this thing's ankle joint. Despite the size& the model is well finished and beautifully balanced: it really does stand there on two legs and menace everything that comes near it. The plastic (vinyl?) also seems to be as tough as old boots& as it has survived all kinds of small boy treatment. And apart from being a splendid dinosaur& |Mister Giganotosaurus| (and being able to say that has educational value all on its own) has also become the terror of |baddy| knights and Airfix 1/32nd soldiers& and has been incorporated into most games and lots of imaginative play.An excellent buy& then."
10380,3249,5," Love this model so much... This was bought for my dinosaur mad 3yr old and it's just great.The textures and colours are good but the real gem is in the pose with an open mouth he can 'eat' other dinos... what could be better!This is a big model but it's been to preschool& out on trips in the car& to the beach to make foot prints and he loves the bath!I know when my daughter grows out of this dino he will have plenty of life left in him to be a hand-me-down many times over! I know the price tag looks big but it is so so so worth it.I have to say as sad as it sounds I  think I like this toy as much as my little girl so I think it's a must for any dinosaur fan."
10381,3249,5," I have one of the Schleich Gigantosaurus in my collection in my collection that I purchased this summer down in a model shop in Weymouth.And it's a huge model of this Dinosaur& a very impressive model it is& so impressive i'm seriously thinking of adding another as a breeding pair. As I have the later model that Schleich have done a makeover on& this one of the best Dinosaur models on the market what is available at a reasonable price for such a superb quality model of a Gigantosaurus."
10382,3249,5," Our 5yr. is obsessed with Dinosaurs and was absolutely thrilled when his Gigantosaurus arrived& well packaged as usual by Amazon and before the predicted date. Schleich products are scale models and come with a model 'Human' to show the coparative size. They are collectors pieces and therefore worth the price. The hard material used mean they are indestructable even during the most energetic and robust 'Dinosaur encounters.' A really good buy."
10383,3249,4," Not as big as i thought it would be being called giganotosaurus&brilliant detail im sure my son will have hours of fun playing with it. Its a bit pricey when at full price if you can get it for under Â£15 its reasonable."
10384,3250,5," excellent item...very chuffed with this purchase as i loved the film and when i found out these were available.naturally i had to have one and at a reasonable price too"
10385,3251,5," My four year old son loves this worth every penny. Bought buddy aswell and other dinosaur train toys. I think we may be collecting them :-)."
10386,3251,5," my 2 year old dino mad son absolutely loves boris it is as described and i think a really good price compared to other similar products on the market which are over priced! its great that it interacts with other toys from the cartoon series as this gives me options for christmas and birthdays!"
10387,3251,5," Product arrived on time and was as described my nephew loves it and was great that the batteries were included so he could play with it straight away."
10388,3251,5," My son (almost 3yrs old) was bought this for Christmas and he absolutely loves it! We had never heard of the show but my nan got him it as he asked her for a dinosaur for Christmas. It was an instant hit and now two weeks later he still carries about everywhere& mainly dragging it behind him by the tail. It has a small button on the back that when pressed activates the different phrases and a larger button that creates a chomping motion and sound - which my son found highly funny when he shared his pork pie with Boris on Boxing Day! Language can be switched between English& Spanish and Effects Only by a button on the underside. The only downside is it hasn't got a permanent off switch& when left untouched for a period of time he will eventually start snoring and go in to Sleep Mode - it will then be turned back on once the small button is pressed again on its back - this snoring regularly makes me jump so I'm guessing it has to be left for 5 to 10 mins before it activates Sleep Mode. My son has since spent some of his Christmas money on another of the interactive dinosaurs which added an whole new element of fun in to his play - the interaction between them is very entertaining!"
10389,3251,3," I have bought this product for my 2 year old son for Christmas but Boris has started ticking like a clock and isn't working. Has anyone else had this problem? I'm thinking it may be the batteries but don't want to remove it from the packaging incase it is broken."
10390,3251,5," Wow!! My son ( who is 3) saw this in a shop and it was Â£40! He fell in love with it& So glad I came on Amazon to check if I could get it cheaper- it's massive!  now ready to go in his Christmas sack I will have one happy little boy! Thanks!"
10391,3251,5," I purchased boris and tank for my 3 year old great nephew who is dinosaur mad.My husband and I tested them to see how the interaction works and both said how fabulous these are extremely pleased"
10392,3251,5," This Dinosaur talks to the Triceratops which was so good I played with it myself before wrapping it up for my Grandsons birthday .He is totally | into | Dinosaurs ."
10393,3252,4," This is one of those toys that fell into the played with for a couple of days& and then left in the car box category. It makes a rare appearance& the boys like it but don't love it. We own the larger and louder remote controlled version& which has been a hit with them& if not with my hearing.I suspect that this toy will be passed onto a younger cousin within the next six months.On the plus side& well packaged& quick delivery and did survive the initial onslaught intact."
10394,3252,5," Bought for 4 year old& he's very pleased with it!"
10395,3252,5," Grandson loves it."
10396,3253,5," I'm torn& not by the monstrous talons of Therizinosaurus but where to start with the review? Do I tell you about how great Schleich dinosaur models are. The lovely painting (all done by hand apparently). The detail of the construction& which has to be the best on the market. Or do I tell you that yet again Schleich have created a great dinosaur model (albeit without feathers - it seems that they are all meant to have feathers these days?)My daughter& budding paelentologist age 4 3/4 loved this& and has added it to her 10 strong Schleich collection.They are expensive in comparison with manufacturers but they are worth every extra penny because of the quality.Highly recommended.P.s. Have added photo of the dinosaur out the back of my house to keep my daughter happy and to maybe give a better view of quality."
10397,3253,5," There is no getting away from it& this is a quality well made toy. it comes well packaged (including little moulded gloves covering the claws to protect them during transit) its well painted& its very solid and heavier than expected and has articulated arms and lower jaw.Gave it to the 3.5 year old nephew and it didnt leave his side for the rest of the day (its now called Paddy...) He wasnt perturbed by the lack of 'on switch' (he looked for an on switch in a soft toy once - yes& really!) and 'Paddy' was soon rampaging through the houseAny negatives? the tail is strong& solid and quite pointy& it could hurt& should your little one be prone to flailing/throwing toys etcThis is honestly a better class of dinosaur!"
10398,3253,5," My nine year old& dinosaur obsessed son bought this with his own birthday money and was absolutely thrilled with it. Great quality& very inspiring and just a super toy/model.He knows it's proper name& I just refer to it as the clawrasaurus!Go for it!"
10399,3253,4," Schleich make a vast range of animal and dinosaur figures of excellent quality and this Therizinosaurus is no exception. Whilst it is more of a model than a toy this is one of their larger figures and has moving front legs and jaw. The claws are a little sharp so it would be suited more to older children from around 7+. Like their other products this doesn't come boxed but would still make a good& if somewhat expensive& gift for a dinosaur fan."
10400,3253,4," Schleich have a reputation for making high quality dinosaur and other animal models& and the Therizinosaur model continues in that tradition.Though it is described here as an action figure& toy model would be a more apt description& having only articulated arms and jaw. The quality of the sculpture is superb with lots of fine detail and a realistic look. It's nice to see a theropod dinosaur model featuring feathers as well& as these creatures were often feathered.My only qualm with the model is that Schleich have made Therizinosaur look quite mean and raptor-like& and though it may have looked like this& it was actually a herbivore.Overall& this is a great addition to our growing dinosaur collection."
10401,3253,4," This is less of a toy and more of a museum model. It's beautifully modeled& and the colour scheme is imaginative.Just a couple of problems: Where are the feathers? Other members of this family (it's a therapod like velociraptor and t-rex) have been found with beautifully preserved feathers. These are missing from this model.Now my versionfrom vine) doesn't have a box or leaflet& so while it looks like a carnivore& it's actually herbivorous. The only fossilized remains found are the Arm and shoulders plus the lower legs and feet. The rest is based on its smaller family members.If you want a dinosaur that's a little different than the usual& you can't really do better than this."
10402,3253,4," We own a large collection of dinosaur toys from Schleich papo and collecta.This is our latest addition to the collection& an interesting vegetarian therapod with 1 meter long claws.The model itself is large and has articulated jaws and claws.I am not sure how long the claws will last intact with my 2 years old but they seem sturdy enough.It has very bright colours and I really wonder if the dinosaur did look like that in real life& it would have been very hard to get camouflaged like this.Is very well made& with some resin and some rubber in parts to make more durable."
10403,3253,5," Wonderfully made these are the best most detailed dinosaurs& this 1 is my sons favourite sits on a table next to his bed."
10404,3254,4," This was a gift for my 6 year old son. He loves dinosaurs - he loves playmobil. Like all playmobil don't be fooled by the size of the box! it is not so big really& but& my son still loved it and has played with it alot."
10405,3254,5," My 4 year old grand daughter loved it once grandad had spent an hour putting it together (After Christmas day lunch....it wasnt easy!). Once assembled it takes about 2 to 3 minutes to put all the bits of the volcano together and then grand daughter presses a button and the volcano erupts (kind of) and the top pops off and their is an avalanche of sorts as the side of the volcano slides down. The eruption takes about 1 second to be followed by grandad putting everything back in place (2 to 3 minutes) and repeat...endlessly!granddaughter then discovered the trilobite fossil can be eaten by the dinosaur (and gets stuck in the dinosaurs mouth between its teeth) which she found highly amusing. After about an hour she found she could easily fit herself in the box this came in& close the box and then jump out! ( its a BIG box) which then became her favorite game of Christmas for the next hour."
10406,3254,5," Grandson and Grandad enjoyed playing with this playmobil toy.  About right for a five year old or maybe older& any child into dinosaurs really.  Went down well but box was very big!  Luckily son had room in car!"
10407,3254,5," I recently purchased this product for my son's Birthday and I could not be happier. The product itself is a fantastic concept for children over the age of 4 and is suitable for both boys and girls.The box includes lots of small accessories however it also includes some fun dinosaurs and an erupting volcano! I did find it hard to set the volcano up however once it was set up& it was easy to use and seems to be childproof against my son's playing.This set is pricer than most of the Playmobil sets however this is a key set if your child loves the Dinos range. We have a lot of the smaller Dino sets and nothing comes close to how good this set is.The accessories you will find in this set include trees& people& dinos - overall great quality and a well thought out set from Playmobil"
10408,3254,3," A lot of small parts for very young children and was a bit of a pain setting up. But the child likes it although I can safely say half the stuff will be lost in no time. Either lost or hoovered up by mistake.Bought when on offer but wouldn't pay full price."
10409,3254,2," The 2 dinosaurs are excellent but the Volcano and other parts are poor. The box is enormous but what's inside is certainly not value for money."
10410,3254,5," My grandson& Toby aged 4& was so over the moon with his present said& whilst opening it |This is SO cool|.  So it made his grandparents day too.  Thank you"
10411,3254,5," great toy. excellent quality. great detail even in the smaller toys. my 4 year old son absolutely loves this. have added some of the other dinosaur playmobil to it"
10412,3255,5," I bought this for my Grandson for this 4th birthday. Very pleased with it.  Appears to be very good quality too.  I am sure he is going to love it.  Quick delivery as well. Certainly no complaints from me!"
10413,3255,5," My son loved this. It's a great size and very realistic. It's soft enough to be manhandled by a 3 year old without hurting anyone and just soft enough to be a sleeping companion! Great for any dinosaur lover."
10414,3255,5," This is a great toy& my grandson loves it."
10415,3255,5," Brilliant dinosaur. Purchased a few more. Great size my 1 and 5 year old both love them"
10416,3255,5," Bought it for my nephew. He loves it. It looks very realistic and is made of good quality rubbery material.You wont be disappointed"
10417,3255,5," A great softer plastic dinosaur rather than the very hard ones easily found - not super soft though& so maybe 3+."
10418,3255,5," My three year old loves this& safe for him to play with as they are soft& very life like"
10419,3256,5," Pleased with this as grandson will love it.  Better and larger than expected seeing it is a current Disney figure especially for the price."
10420,3257,4," a great figure&realistic and well-made -I wish I could say the same for the packaging- the gun on the outstretched arm broke in the post& ok it is delicate & but the seller should realise and make sure it is properly and securely wrapped. I tried superglue-it didn't work& so my grandson was a little disappointed. However the figure sits well on the horse and the details& such as spurs& almost make up for it!"
10421,3257,5," Well thats the name my son gave him .Not sure who Lewis is but my son must know.Great figure with great detail.He will need both guns he is fighting a t-rex&the hulk&spiderman and the rest.Bring it on."
10422,3257,5," I am really pleased with all the things I purchased  mant thanks"
10423,3257,5," ideal for matching up with our cactus plant."
10424,3257,3," a little small"
10425,3258,4," There aren't a great deal of model pterosaurs on the market and I'm sorry to say that the majority are absolute bobbins. I've seen pteranodons that make me want to weep with despair. Batwings? Christ on a bike.This Tapejara is a proud exception. It's nicely sculpted& beautifully painted and a fantastic reminder of just how weird and wonderful prehistoric nature was. Good price& too. Nice work& Safari!"
10426,3258,5," I brought this dinosaur thinking it would last 2 minutes since it was so cheap but it's fab!! My daughter loves the flying ones and my son just loves everything about dinosaurs!lolIt was delivered very quickly and came with a little label with a bit of info on the tapejara(think that's how it's spelt)I have to add it soft plastic and not like the really hard ones but seems durable so far and is bigger than i thought it would be. Overall a very good buy will deffo buy more from the Safari range!"
10427,3258,4," My son is dinosaur mad and this is great for him as he can happily move the wings without it breaking which is what I wanted as he likes to pretend its flying around the house. Shame it wasn't that bit bigger but then again its quite cheap so thats ok."
10428,3259,5," Bought this as a gift for my class as we will be learning about the dinosaurs next term. Figured I'd buy one as a trial first to check it was of good quality and I was thoroughly pleased with it! The product is of good size (about the size of your hand)& I was worried about it being too small! It took about 2 days for the cracks to begin to show and perhaps around a week to start fully emerging from the egg. I have purchased another one and look forward to seeing my pupils faces when it hatches again!"
10429,3259,5," Such good fun when you waiting for those to hatch& cute little things :)"
10430,3259,3," This was bought for a 7year old boy for Christmas.  He really loved it but I have marked it down as the shell was already cracked when he took it out of his packaging although it still did work to a degree... dinosaur did grow but did not have many features so was just a little lump of plastic without much form."
10431,3259,5," Not taken out of the box yet as its part of a Christmas pressie. It's small but looks quite good. Paid 5/6pounds - I think that's a reasonable price for the product. Arrived well before it should have. I think my niece will be pleased this gift"
10432,3259,5," Amazing my granddaughter loved this& she was so excited watching it every day trying to get out of the egg& have also bought one now for my nephew for xmas& great buy."
10433,3259,5," these are fascinating toys for little ones& educational and hold the child's interest for days while dinosaur hatching."
10434,3259,4," this looks ok&however there were no instructions with it so i have had to copy them off here for my grandson"
10435,3259,5," Were bought as an xmas present for friends two young kids.  They loved them.  Fun wee stocking filler."
10436,3260,5," My four-year-old nephew was thrilled with this. Having already bought him a set of Dinosaur Train toys& we were looking for something different and were a bit worried this wouldn't be so exciting for him but he was very impressed. The sounds and the light-up eyes were a winner. The toy itself looks very sturdy and would stand a bit of a bashing. My nephew& however& prefers to be gentler with his dinosaurs and tucks them up at night to keep them warm. A good toy for any dino-mad child. I would recommend it."
10437,3260,3," Little one is on a |I Love Dinosaurs| stage. So got him this. He loves the sound. Though I wonder how long it will last& since he keeps trying to ride the thing by attempting to sit on it!"
10438,3260,5," My grandson and the dog loved it!"
10439,3260,4," Great"
10440,3260,5," Much& much better than the collapsible 'Walking with Dinosaurs' gorgon"
10441,3261,4," Arlo is the main character in Disney Pixarâ€™s latest movie& â€œThe Good Dinosaur.â€ This poseable figure is suitable for 3+ and is 17.5 cm high. He comes with a little critter& hanging to his tail. I think it would have been nicer& and made more sense& had the figure included a little â€˜Spotâ€™ figure â€“ particularly as the other poseable figures in this particular range (according to the packaging) donâ€™t seem to include him.  Of course& Spot is available with different size toys& so make sure you explore all the options before you choose which one to buy.That aside& this is a fun toy. Arlo can more his head and legs and has a nice expression. He can also open and close his mouth. This is a robust toy which will withstand a lot of play. Sure to be much loved by any fans of the film."
10442,3261,5," This is a small-medium sized Arlo figure& from the new Disney Pixar movie |The Good Dinosaur.| After watching the movie& Arlo was definitely my kids favourite character since he is the main character and sort of the hero of the movie as he starts out as an under dog& and then survives his long journey throughout the movie& making a new friend and learning lessons on the way.My kids love dinosaur toys& and of course a Disney branded one that ties into the new movie was always going to be a hit but I really like how this one has been made so poseable with all of the limbs being moveable& so that you can bend the knees and change the position of the legs - something that you don't get with most toy dinosaurs. We have some that slightly move& but not to the extent of these and this extra pose-ability adds extra play value with this. The small-ish size is also a plus for me since it's very portable and takes up less space& but the boys enjoy it as much as a larger dinosaur& and it's also better value.This Arlo comes with a small |critter| which is very small& and they aren't as interested in this as in the main Arlo figure but it's a nice extra.Overall this toy is a great tie in to the movie& and would be enjoyed by any dinosaur fan regardless if they have seen the movie or not& but they would love it even more if they do - since the character is so loveable.[We went along to a promotional screening and were provided with toys for review]"
10443,3261,4," My six year old companion to the Good Dinosaur was lucky enough to be given Arlo after the movie and was beyond thrilled. Arlo is the unlikely hero who starts off as the youngest& smallest& most scared dinosaur& who's teased by his peers and worried over by his parents. In his Odyssey in the movie he triumphs and learns to be courageous as well as kind and to manage his fears. He is absolutely the top most desirable dinosaur for anyone that's seen the movie. My companion's Arlo has relived his adventures several times and is responding robustly to being reshaped and walked around the bedroom endlessly very well."
10444,3261,5," This is by Luke Lepley who went along to the movie screening then got to play with the toys !!!|This toy is a character called Arlo. It is well made and stable. You can change what  he looks like by moving his arms&  legs and mouth.  He also has a small critter that comes with him. The critter hooks onto his tail. He looks just like the cartoon character. He is made of soft plastic not a really hard plastic. He has scales on his back and front.| - He says it's a great toy so 5 stars !!!"
10445,3261,5," Having thoroughly enjoyed 'The Good Dinosaur' movie with my 7 yearold daughter& we both thought Arlo was a lovable little character set against the stunning photo-real backgrounds of the film. This high-quality toy from Tomy / Disney would appeal to a child whether they have seen the film or not& but especially if they are inspired by Arlo's journey in the tale. He also comes with a little mini 'critter' which only really makes sense if you've seen the film.He is a good size for a toy that might go everywhere with your child& boxed nicely to give his context in the film and made to Tomy's usual reliable high quality. He stands up nicely and can be placed in various postures with his mouth open or closed.At the RRP& I actually think he's rather good value given the usual premium for movie merchandise and Disney in particular. Recommended"
10446,3262,5," I bought the self adhesive Moustaches as part of goods for the party bag for my daughter's birthday and the kids loved it.  It looks so real and they had a big fun& even the girls."
10447,3262,5," Perfect for party bags for both girls and boys oh and adults!!!!"
10448,3262,3," It's ok"
10449,3263,5," I bought this along with 3 others from this range of figures (Brachiosaurus& T-Rex and Stegosaurus) for my three boys aged 3-6. They fell in love with them immediately as they absolutely adore anything Dinosaur related.The models are handpainted in lifelike colours. They're not as detailed or precise as models you'd buy from the likes of Papo& Schleich or Natural History Museum. But then again& I see these more as a toy than a model and they have movable parts too.The dinosaurs arrived well packed and in a nice display box. As a bonus& they also all had a real piece of dino poo (coprylite) inside which my eldest thought was hilarious! I actually wondered what was rattling inside the box until I opened it and made the discovery (but it does say this on the box too!)They are a nice addition to my boys existing and ever growing collection of dinosaurs and look and feel robust enough to stand the test of time.I received these items at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and I am very pleased indeed with my purchases."
10450,3264,5," This toy was aimed for a boy with a very specific wish. The joy in that boys face when he opened his present was priceless.I also want to thank Takara Co.& LTD for their efficiency regarding my order. It took less than 10 days from Japan to Sweden. Excellet!"
10451,3265,5," this was bought as a present and was received with great exitement and pleasure& my grandaughter has played very happily with it since"
10452,3265,5," My son loves playmobil and he was given some of the western sets& so i am getting this for him to add to the sets he has."
10453,3265,3," A good toys with lots of potential"
10454,3265,5," Came on time on problems"
10455,3266,5," Steggiesaurus by Collecta& no actually Stegosaurus a lot of models are made of this famous dinosaur& I wasn't sure if the one illustrated was the one in my collection& as there are so many out there the good the bad and the (no I'm not going to say that!) But even your like mine is of second hand missing some paint it's one of the best and I have no more to compare it against. The model is in a good realistic pose with a good decent elaborate paint job all over the model from the grey green body up to the sand and dark brown edges of the plates along the back to the tiny yellow eyes of the beast."
10456,3267,5," Excellent Toy& Grandson Loves Dinosaurs so I will be visiting Seller again to start collecting . Excellent 5 Star will recommend to all."
10457,3268,3," This is a product review for the Jim Hensonâ€™s Dinosaur Train Mr. Conductor figure made by TOMY. The figure comes nicely packaged which is colourful and easy to open and release the figure from.  Mr. Conductor stands just shy of 8 inches.Sculpt: The figure is very accurate to the tv show character"
10458,3268,5," Purchased for our Grand daughter for her 6th birthday and she just loves it.Mr Conductor probably interacts more than any other Dinosaur& and sings the theme tune too.Can recommend this to any child who enjoys the Dinosaur train."
10459,3268,5," My son love this character and I had to get it for him. My son has the rest of the interaction characters and they all keep him quite."
10460,3268,5," Would recommend this for any dinosaur train fan we have a few of these bought for Christmas and they all talk to each other was rather funny wrapping them for Christmas and they were talking to each other under the tree"
10461,3268,4," Great price& sometimes doesn't work with my sons other talking dinosaurs as its a little larger and it's hard to line them up. Ok on its on says a few phrases. Says it talks more than we have been able to get it to do."
10462,3268,5," 3.5 year old son utterly deluge with this. Bought this and the Ned one and the interaction works really well. I quite like it too! Good price too."
10463,3268,5," great toy& bigger and better than I thought it would be& my grandson loves it&fantastic price and fast delivery& highly recommend"
10464,3268,4," My son has a few of these interactive dinosaurs& its great when they all start having a chat!! Decent size toys."
10465,3269,5," Great"
10466,3270,5," Ceratosaurus dinosaur by Safari first let me tell you a few things& once you have removed it from it's transparent stand it tends always to fall over to the left or to the right. But it's a simple of matter of straightening the legs& The model itself however is a vast improovement on the old green one what AAA use to produce the Safari one is spot on in scale to that of a human unlike the other what was far too large the sand coulouring of the model is faultless. One thing that is outstanding is the dinosaurs eyes they are superb how they managed to get the yellow eye with a black center is astonishing I said the model had a sand body well not everywhere as they have a pink lower jaw and neck blending into a white underside."
10467,3271,4," Came a little slower than I wanted thank you good for kids and parents alike easy fun to Play with anyone"
10468,3271,5," brilliant just what I wanted for my grandsons birthday cake"
10469,3271,5," Brilliant love Bullyland figures."
10470,3271,4," Great fun"
10471,3272,4," well made"
10472,3273,4," Simple but fun& still a favourite toy of my youngest son despite having had it for a while now. Very well made and able to withstand the 'throw everything against a wall' phase of my youngest son."
10473,3273,3," Smaller than I expected for the money. But a great toy all the same my little boy seems to enjoy it."
10474,3273,5," My son loves switch and go dino products he's a great fan and he's only 4 and 11 months old."
10475,3273,5," fun& clever little car-dino. Very strong for hard play and perfect for little hands!"
10476,3273,5," The whole range is brilliant& our son loves them and great value at Â£10 each!"
10477,3273,4," Good quality product at a very reasonable price!"
10478,3274,5," Good"
10479,3275,5," This was very well received by my 6 year old grandson.  The first package arrived damaged (having been dumped at the bottom of the very apologetic courier's sack!) and was INSTANTLY replaced (Special Delivery& flown from Edinburgh to Stansted) by the supplier& at NO cost by the supplier.  I was told to keep the original rather than go to the trouble of returning it and give it to |some little boy who would like it for Christmas|& which I did.  Expensive for what it is& but VERY popular& it seems.  And superb treatment from the supplier."
10480,3276,5," Schleich Kentrosaurus is a superb model and far superior to the totally drab one made by CollectA& the paint work is a total knockout& Schleich's painters have gone to work on this model totally& I got this recently on holiday and was blown away by the pose and stance and not forgetting the paintwork I love it your Kentrosaurus is small and stunning but the model has menace added just see how spooked the Kentrosaurus is nice work Schleich! Here is some more info on this type of beastie& 1 it's over scale! It's a nice model but it's like a Kentrosaurus on steroids Most who collect 1"
10481,3276,5," Lovely addition to my son's Schleich dinosaur collection. It's nice to have a different dinosaur as they do like to focus on T Rex& Velociraptors etc."
10482,3276,5," Excellent range and make& could never fault these dinosaurs best on the market by far"
10483,3276,5," super spikey and realistic"
10484,3277,5," Great value"
10485,3278,5," This is sold as an educational toy& with an added information booklet& which has been handpainted for display. This obviously appeals to adult buyers who like to think that the item they are buying for children will be educational. In truth& I suspect it is far more likely to be used as a toy by the child who receives it rather than a display item.The dinosaur is about four inches high and about eight inches long and is made of a hard plastic. It is well finished with colours that I suspect may be more realistic than many you see. The teeth are big and white with a hinged jaw to make the mouth open and shut. There are no other moving parts on the toy. It is ideal for imaginative play by young children as it stands up well by itself and is big enough to grip and move easily. It seems to be very robust and well made.It comes with a generic booklet about dinosaurs which has nothing in it which won't already be known by a child with an interest in dinosaurs or who has a collection of books about them.The unique selling point of this dinosaur as opposed to the many other models on the market is the dinosaur poo fossil which is included (or poop as they describe it on the box). It's only very small but is mounted on a bit of cardboard and will be a talking point for small children for a long time - it is the inclusion of this small item that makes this unsuitable for children under three.This toy is aimed at the adult buyer who will be attracted by the fact that it is educational and pleased that it is robust and well made. I suspect that it will be loved by small children who will be delighted by the hinged jaw and overwhelmed by owning a bit of dinosaur poo. I received a free dinosaur in exchange for an honest review."
10486,3278,5," I bought this along with 3 others from this range of figures (Brachiosaurus& Triceratops and Stegosaurus) for my three boys aged 3-6. They fell in love with them immediately as they absolutely adore anything Dinosaur related.The models are handpainted in lifelike colours. They're not as detailed or precise as models you'd buy from the likes of Papo& Schleich or Natural History Museum. But then again& I see these more as a toy than a model and they have movable parts too.The dinosaurs arrived well packed and in a nice display box. As a bonus& they also all had a real piece of dino poo (coprylite) inside which my eldest thought was hilarious! I actually wondered what was rattling inside the box until I opened it and made the discovery (but it does say this on the box too!)They are a nice addition to my boys existing and ever growing collection of dinosaurs and look and feel robust enough to stand the test of time.I received these items at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and I am very pleased indeed with my purchases."
10487,3278,5," I absolutely love these dinosaurs! I got both the Stegosaurus and the T-Rex& and both are beautiful. The packaging is smart and shows off the toy. The toys themselves are high quality& beautifully finished& and come with genuine fossilised dino poop& which my husband and I were quite impressed with& and which I'm sure would blow the minds of any dinosaur-loving children. My toddler is a bit little for them just yet& but that's okay& I'm more than happy to look after them until she's bigger. I need to add a raptor to the collection...I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these to anyone.Disclaimer: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
10488,3278,5," This was purchased for my grandson who is 6 this year and loves everything dinosaur! Don't they all at that age. Although quite a garish colour it is a magnificent beast and I know he will be thrilled with it& particularly with the genuine dinosaur poo that is also included . The booklet that comes with it is very informative. As a whole this is a gift that is going to last and last. I couldn't be more pleased with it  and look forward to adding to the collection.I was offered this product at a reduced rate in exchange for an honest review."
10489,3279,4," this is a great varierty set&  great for small world play.  The product packaging was damaged on arrival& but as it arrived packaged in a box i suspect this happened prior to posting& which I think should have been checked& but the actual animals are great.  just a shame we cant keep them in the tube."
10490,3280,4," Great product a bit springy a bit more flexible than other figures and maybe a cupple of mm bigger but my son wont mind."
10491,3280,5," ALL GOOD THANK YOU"
10492,3281,5," Excellent quality toys - my son loves them!"
10493,3282,5," My girlfriend just loved this doll. She collects them"
10494,3283,4," Playmobil always a good choice. Lots of little bits to go with the bike. Bought this to go with the volcano as an accessory. The dinosaurs have been played with the most though! Fast delivery.  No seller complaints"
10495,3283,5," My nine-year-old daughter just loves playmobil. Thet are great quality toys which help children develop their habilities and imagination. Very good service."
10496,3283,5," My Grandson was delighted with this& as he collects prehistoric animal toys& playmobil is very good value for money. Excellent."
10497,3283,4," some of the peices as a bit small for inpatient children but our grandson was very pleased with it as he is only six and into anything to do with the outdoor life"
10498,3283,4," it's resulted in hours of playing and exploring and possibly too many questions about motorbikes and the possibility of getting one"
10499,3283,5," Bought Grandson Playmobil dinosaur volcano for his birthday..was very pleased with quality so decided to buy a few more in the set as stocking fillers.....especially at such a cheap price."
10500,3283,4," I love these play Mobil toys and so does my five year old grandson They are great for imaginative play.cant fault them."
10501,3283,5," bought this item to go with a dinosaur for my grandson& he was very pleased with it.it fits well with the range."
10502,3284,5," Nice and brightly coloured with feathers details also nicely made. It is also in a nice pose to put on a tree branch or arm for photos.Came in good time and condition."
10503,3284,5," Can not wait for it to come bought it today on here on June 28th 2015 my fav dinosaur bird so I can not wait for it to come do i can get my hands on it"
10504,3284,5," What my son wanted& excellent!"
10505,3284,4," Product as described"
10506,3285,3," Disappointed as ordered two in the hope that one might be one of the better more exciting dinosaurs& but unfortunately was sent two of the more boring ones! I don't see how anyone is supposed to |collect all 6| if you can't choose the ones you want! What a shame.Toys are quite good size and should be fun to play with but disappointed we got sent two herbavours!!"
10507,3285,1," After a long search I thought I had finally found the longed for dinosaur. As it stated by the seller that you are unable to choose the one you need and after reading the reviews regarding the same issue i have decided to continue my search. Im not prepared to take 'pot luck' when there is only one i need to buy. As a customer said& how are you supposed to collect the set when you cant select the dinosaur you need. Very disappointed"
10508,3285,4," I've ordered 3 of these dinosaurs and none of them were a T-Rex (surprise surprise).  If you're not fussy about which one you get these are wonderful.  My son loves all dinosaurs hence 4 stars but I have been put off trying to complete the set as you cannot select which one you would like."
10509,3285,5," My grandson was  very excited when we gave him this dinosaur for his birthday and the response from his was brilliant &the only comment I have is that you can't pick the one you want the seller sends out a random one &it would be much better if you could order the specific dinosaur &apart from that they were of good quality and arrived very soon after I put my order in &well worth the money ."
10510,3285,4," Good but wanted the T. rex think u should get a choice"
10511,3285,5," My 2 and half year old has received the brontasaurus for Christmas and it is her favourite present! She absolutely loves it and we will be ordering for here again. Thank you for making my daughters day!"
10512,3285,5," Theses are christmas present great buy love them thinking about getting another set delivery was spot on nice"
10513,3285,3," Very happy with quick delivery even it's pre-Christmas period!!Toys are quite good size and should be fun to play with but disappointed as I ordered three and got two long-necked herbivores!!You can not chose which one you'd like to receive when you're ordering& but if you order more than one you should be able to receive all different types. What a shame."
10514,3286,5," My grandson loves this."
10515,3287,3," Although at first disappointed with the size of the moulds.  All of them fit onto one piece of plastic.  However my grandson was very pleased and he really enjoyed the experience of making and painting the dinosaurs."
10516,3287,3," my son really enjoyed making this up& so i am happy.but i found that the paint was not so child friendly& when it dried it stuck like plastic and wasn't great cos it made mess everywhere.son still smiling though and proud of his little dinosaur badges that glow in the dark.i'd buy it again."
10517,3287,4," This is a great creative toy foe the child who likes to get down and dirty..it is both educational and fun& but once completed needs to be handled carefully.&&&good value and service."
10518,3287,4," A great pack of fun for kids and teenagers. The small detailed features on the dinosaurs aren't as clear as I hoped when released from the plastic mould. However the process of mixing plaster& pouring and painting makes up for the fun we all had."
10519,3287,3," I'm giving this item a low rating as it's not what it looks like in the cover photo. I expected the same item and the box it came is is not as nice. However this was a gift and the boy I have it to was still impressed with it."
10520,3287,5," Bought this for our pre-school.  Was great fun to make and paint& all the children enjoyed it.  The moulds are reuseable so much more fun will be had from this product."
10521,3287,5," This makes nice little models"
10522,3287,5," The kids absolutely loved mixing the plaster and painting these models. I only wish it came with more plaster mix."
10523,3288,4," Used this to make chocolate fudge as its way to small for cake making. However when I posted a picture of the resulting chocolate loveliness people said it looked like a dog poo!  It tasted good though.  That's the chocolate&  not the poo. In fact this chocolate can do the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs!"
10524,3288,5," This is quite small but it worked so well with chocolate! Very easy to remove and came out perfectly& no bubbles!"
10525,3288,5," Arrived quickly& and worked excellent as a chocolate mould. The Star Wars cake turned out amazing."
10526,3288,5," The Kids Love these. They dont last as long as the Death Star ones but they are great for a G"
10527,3288,5," It's so good surprising fellow Star Wars fans with these in their drinks.Bought for me by my wife as a present. Hoping to get the Death Star one next."
10528,3289,5," educational and fun"
10529,3290,5," Paleontological accuracy:The good:As Stegosaurs models go this takes joint first place for accuracy& along with the Schicich.  Almost perfectly proportioned"
10530,3291,5," As described"
10531,3292,5," Awesome pop& packaged well too"
10532,3292,4," Awesome gift many thanks"
10533,3292,4," Good figure& very rare to find...aswell as dark knight rises bane. Figure very similar to catwoman from classic tv series but isn't covered in glitter. However& the figure does come with a hook on the back& as if this was pulled off a shelf...so i removed it. Other than that...good figure"
10534,3292,5," good value"
10535,3293,5," Arrived quickly& grandson delighted with it!"
10536,3293,3," Nice item& but was smaller than I expected."
10537,3293,5," Fantastic"
10538,3294,5," As described"
10539,3295,5," Rajasaurus by Collecta& the first thing you notice is the superb paint work on the model it really sets it of nicely and not another model of one of the ten a dozen dinosaur types what are out there. Collecta have modelled this well but it's the paint work on it's body that make it stand out from the crowd other words a lovely medium seized model of a flesh eating dinosaur."
10540,3296,5," The schleich mini dinosaurs are very small (fit in the palm of my 5 year olds hand) but they are beautifully detailed and perfect for a dinosaur mad child to carry in their pocket."
10541,3296,5," These are teeny tiny but are great love the collect but thought they were bigger that what we got. Bit disappointed but a start to a new collection"
10542,3296,4," This look great - almost lifelike"
10543,3296,5," grandson loves it"
10544,3297,5," A lot smaller than i thought it would be and on first inspection i had to take a second look to see if it was definitely a t- rex& but in saying that it was for my 3yr old son to add to his collection and he loved it so thats what matters."
10545,3297,5," The schleich mini dinosaurs are very small (fit in the palm of my 5 year olds hand) but they are beautifully detailed and perfect for a dinosaur mad child to carry in their pocket."
10546,3297,3," This look great - but not quite lifelike"
10547,3298,5," This was a great buy even cheaper than most stores&my girlfriend loved it & i left it as an whole banner although you can cut it into three& great buy & i&d recommend this& no post and packaging either."
10548,3298,3," Just a banner that you can pick up anywhere for Â£1. Looks nothing like image& which suggests it is bigger than it is."
10549,3298,5," Love it!  Fast delivery& as described.  Good product"
10550,3298,5," Very good quality"
10551,3299,5," brilliant for my daughter's 18th"

10555,3300,5," Perfect for years to come!"
10556,3301,1," Don't know what I was expecting but could have bought same or better in 99p shop or Poundland!!! Problem as always buying off the internet you can't see what  you are buying.My own fault!!!!!"

10565,3304,5," Good quality item& as described and colour as shown in photograph. It comes in one length and you can cut into three pieces.  Item arrived quickly and no hesitation to recommend this product and seller.  The only niggle was the over packing (too much cello tape put on the package and it was difficult to take the foil out and I was worried whether it will damage& but ok at the end)."
10566,3304,5," so much bunting in one packet& enough to decorate doors& windows& walls. Very impressed and excellent value for money& all the children at the birthday party we had loved looking at them and made the house look |party| ready."

10572,3307,5," Brilliant quality & and looks the part"
10573,3308,5," I brought this item to use at my own 30th birthday part and was very pleased with it. I would recommend buying this product and the delivery time was spot on and arrived nicely wrapped up so thank you."
10574,3308,5," Great banner& done great job& liked by the birthday girl. Any local shops has not have such a choice and options& majority very dark background& this worked like a treat."

10581,3309,5," Ordered this bunting to enhance my Australia Day celebrations& and it was better than I had hoped for. Nice quality& good length& big flags and printed both sides with good colour. Made the room look fab!"
10582,3309,3," The Australian flags were very bright and colourful and served the purpose of an Australian relative visiting my family for a celebration& however& two of the flags soon split away from the tape and I had to sew them back together before hanging them up in my garden."
10583,3309,5," Bloomin' fantastic for price!"
10584,3310,4," I got this for my daughters first birthday. Unfortunately no postage was put on the product so i had to pay Â£1.50 to the royal mail to get this sent back to me which considering the cost of the item i wasn't happy about!! The product was nice though"
10585,3310,5," This item was delivered when it said it would be&very fast service&pleased with the banners so will my little girl be when she wakes up on her birthday to see them in the windows."
10586,3310,5," well worth money and would be buying from again when needed. I found these pretty strong and lasted far longer"
10587,3310,5," Fab for our daughters special day"
10588,3311,5," Great banner& looks exactly as it does in the picture. It's nice and light& so easy to stick up with a few bits of cellotape& or it has loops on the ends to hang off things. It's made of thin cardboard& but is good quality"

10600,3313,5," Great banner !"
10601,3314,4," Really good cheap& easy hen decorations that i would definitely recommend for just a little decoration wanted somewhere like a night club."
10602,3315,4," This toy comes and go's. It is a real hit when other children come round& and was a real hit initially. Plays well& there is a nack to it. Fun.Pretty sturdy& it is pushed around in the bottom of a toy box and no broken bits yet& we have had it a year.If your child is musical it is a good one to buy."
10603,3315,4," We bought this a little over a year ago and it is still being played daily! It does take a little puff to get a sound from the notes at the bottom of the sax but my children are too young to worry about playing a proper tune! They love it and it has stood the test of time."
10604,3315,5," great instrument blow as hard as you like and not to loud been played with for 2 years now still going strong"
10605,3315,4," I bought this for one of my grandsons so he can play with the other 2 one on the toy keyboard and the other with a little rock guitar.Hours of fun and they make quite an interesting sound collectively. The boys are 3&3 and 2 years old so we are starting them young"
10606,3315,5," My son loves this toy& he is 2 and 3/4 and quickly picked up how to play it."
10607,3315,5," We bought this toy saxophone for our son& who is 6.  He really loves it& and it's also been great for when he has his friends over."
10608,3315,5," I bought this for my husband for his birthday&he has been on about wanting to play the saxaphone for ages so rather than buy a real one I bought this and he was delighted with it& although he does keep trying to play it in the bedroom!!!!!!"
10609,3315,3," A present for my sons 4th birthday& we bought the trumpet from the same range last year but it sadly got trodden on and cracked.These are not intended to be dropped& thrown or played with roughly.....so not great for very small children. This was given on the understanding that it had to be looked after and so far so good! The noise that comes out is not ear-piercing as with some musical toys we have owned& I paid a fair price and it has made him very happy but I would have happily paid a bit more if it meant it was more robust."
10610,3316,5," This is a bargain and gets the msg out there .covered a few windows a good buy and would recommend to family and friends"
10611,3316,5," Added a touch of pizazz to teenage daughters party. Good length allowed to cut it up and make 2 good sized banners...could easily have made 3!"

10615,3317,5," As advertised"
10616,3318,3," Would have been perfect if it didn't say Happy Engagement. Luckily I'd already bought plenty of others so it didn't matter. Giving 3 stars as the quality is what you'd expect."
10617,3318,5," I ordered this banners because they were cheap they arrived today which was good im very pleased and cant wait to hang them up. Thank You"

10692,3347,5," Wanted a banner for parents 40th wedding anniversary celebrations. Thought some of the banners available looked a bit tacky but thought this one looked quite nice. Was pleased when it arrived - the red on the banner is not bright but a definite ruby and the silver compliments it well. The design is actually repeated 3 times so I cut it into 3 x 3ft banners& but that's personal preference. Not sure the picture online does the banner justice and perhaps confuses the buyer as to how exactly the banner looks. Happy with my purchase and would recommend to anyone with a ruby wedding celebration coming up."
10693,3347,5," This banner is lovely& very good quality and larger than I thought when I ordered it. The delivery was sooner than was anticipated& and the banner was nicely packaged so would not be damaged in the pst. Overall I am very pleased and would& happily& use this supplier again."
10694,3347,5," What a lovely banner& We used it for my parents anniversary and they were thrilled with it! Good value for money and good quality and I would definitely recommend"
10695,3347,3," THey are as described I think they are the most suttle one I have been looking at some banner look cheap but these are quite pleasant"
10696,3347,5," used these to decorate our house for our ruby wedding along with the 40th swirls and it looked great& also very fast delivery"
10697,3347,5," very good quality and value for money. added to the decorations of the room very well. very pleased with it"
10698,3347,4," Just what I  wanted and good value for money.  I got gas filled balloons to match from a local shop"
10699,3347,4," did not arrive in time for my parents 40th anniversary party sadly but good quality."

10710,3352,5," this is for my grand daughter who will be three end of November& she will love it. Cant wait to put it all up for her."
10711,3353,3," 3.5 starsThis vintage looking bunting& does what it's meant to& it decoration for a party.You could add extra colour onto the bunting if you liked by gluing fabric onto the triangle.My only grumble is the bottom points are a little scragglyI received this product for a discounted a price for a n honest review"
10712,3353,5,""
10713,3353,5," These were ADORABLE! I've decided to keep them in our backyard for a while. Thank you!"
10714,3353,5," It was perfect for our event. I would definitely recommend."
10715,3353,5," Super cute! It was really long& great for my bridal shower."
10716,3353,5," Very cute! They were perfect for the wedding of my sister."
10717,3354,4," Pleasantly surprised by this! I'd considered this a bit of a gamble after reading reviews of other identical looking products& but it's really not bad! This was a birthday present for my 6yr old daughter. She's very musical and has been having piano lessons for a while which probably helps& but she's managing to play this really nicely. Quite sturdy& but not too big or heavy. Pitch is pretty good (she can play along with big sisters violin without it being too painful...) it depends on your expectations for this sort of money as to whether it's a good deal - I was not expecting a quality instrument& essentially it's a glorified toy. But it is good enough for her to get the general idea and learn the mechanics of playing. And it's a lot of fun for the rest of us too!!"
10718,3354,4," My grandson was thrilled with this when he opened it at Christmas& the adults liked it as well. A good sound and easy to open and close.  The only criticism is that the little straps that keep the bellows closed when not in use& came off soon after first use. The screws holding the straps on came out.  This was sorted out by using slightly larger screws."
10719,3354,5," Better quality than was expected and arrived in good time"
10720,3355,5," As advertised."
10721,3355,5," Good"

10736,3360,5," Great banner"
10737,3361,4," Graduation coming up and time to celebrate. This banner is not just one HUGE congratulations measuring 2.5m& instead the banner has three |CONGRATULATIONS| written upon it and this means you you cut the banner up into three sections. This means it is quite useful and versatile for parties etc.The material is perhaps a little thin& but good value for money."
10738,3361,5," *** As described& quick delivery& thank you ***"
10739,3361,5," the banner does the job and you get 4 strips."
10740,3362,5," Great for the price done the job"
10741,3363,5," Excellent banners thanks"
10742,3364,5," Bought one banner which was perforated to separate into 3 if desired. Very good quality for the price and ideal alongside other gold decorations."
10743,3364,5," Very good quality were very large."
10744,3364,5," Very nice"
10745,3365,5," Exactly as expected. My daughters loved them& it was just what they asked for& a glittery pink recorder."
10746,3366,5," Good length to have above the table at our daughter's second birthday party. Nice and bright though could rip easily. Speedy delivery."
10747,3366,5," Product as described.  Arrived on time. Thanks :)"
10748,3366,5," Really nice colour and design"
10749,3367,5," Perfect for my little girls christening! 3 banners in one! was able to put in 3 different places - lovely item"
10750,3367,5," good for a christening party decoration& used this for my grandaughters christening&good quality&looked good& plenty of lenth&good all round&useable&looks good."
10751,3367,5," Brought these to decorate the hall for my Granddaughters Christening in June. Ideal to brighten up a room and make her day a bit more special."
10752,3367,3," Ordered these banners for my daughters christening and got these as wanted a pink theme& look good and you get 3 banners out of the strip."
10753,3367,5," This is a lovely banner and went down a treat at the Christening. Delivery was really good and I would recommend this item"
10754,3367,3," Was ok& quite long so we cut in half to make 2 banners :) it is what it is lol"
10755,3367,1," Wrong banners sent. Was sent boy banners and costs to much to send back"
10756,3367,5," Item received looked as advertised and arrived in good order thank you"
10757,3368,4," Very nice but by the pictures I thought they were silver holographic foil and they're actually bright yellow!!"
10758,3369,5," This 15th Birthday Banner was just the ticket and exactly what I was looking for.At 9ft Its a great size and was eye-catching.I have nothing negative to say right down to the cost which in my opinion is better than the shops (thats if you can find one with 15th on).In between ages like 15 are much harder to find and even more so when the timing is not the best.In my case birthday treasures are usually buried away in drawers to make way for the Valentines stock and then straight into Mothers day stock.Really pleased and highly recommend.OOPs forgot to mention My daughter loved it :)"
10759,3369,5," fast delivery && made her 15th special .."
10760,3369,5," Brilliant.Great value for money."

10763,3372,3," Good quality"
10764,3372,5," Good"
10765,3373,5," We bought this great little toy for our son's 4th birthday& because he really wanted a |trumpet|& and it was the perfect thing to get. The instrument is perfectly pitched to 4 fixed notes& which allow children to play a couple of recognisable tunes easily& and the packaging includes finger maps to show them how to play these. I also agree with company's claim that the sound has been designed deliberately so as to not be annoying - in fact it's quite pleasing to the ear and not too loud (much better than so many other musical toys out there& that one ends up hiding away in the furthest cupboard). If you have a child who is musically inclined but too young yet to learn a real instrument& I really recommend this. It improves coordination and introduces children to the notion of being able to play real tunes with an instrument (rather than just random sound collections)& and to the concept of how to follow some kind of score.Overall& this is a really nice quality toy& which I would wholeheartedly recommend."
10766,3373,3," my little boy told me he wanted a trumpet for his birthday& so i looked around and this seemed the best |cheap| trumpet as i didnt want to spend money if he never used it. it was fine and although plastic seems quite robust and the notes are defined. it only came with 2 little colour note music charts& neither of which i had heard of. it would be nice if there had been a little booklet of tunes to play& preferably ones which are recognised tunes.So& he blew it for a bit (quite irritating) and then forgot about it and went back to his train set. still& he was happy to get the birthday present he wanted and thats what matters."
10767,3373,5," Excellent value for money& my 3 year old loves it. Best thing about it as far as I'm concerned is that the noise that comes out of it is not too loud! It also requires rather a lot of puff& so she has to give it a rest after a while! Educational and fun too."
10768,3373,4," We bought a Bontempi trumpet for our son when he was about three. It was almost indestructable and the sound wasn't annoying. He loved it and it lasted a long time.  Our son is ten now and plays several brass instruments rather well.  It was a fun toy and if your child is musical& they'll enjoy it."
10769,3373,5," Bought this for our 2 year old grand son's birthday& having read other reviews. I noted that it's not really recommended for under 3s but he has been showing interest in musical sound encouraged by his parentsHe was able to develop the skills to play and I think distinguish between  the 4 different notes that can be played& quite quickly. The noise given out is not offensive or loud. It has stimulated his interest in other instruments he has been given& but had little interest in playing until now.The trumpet is made of plastic and may not have great longevity& but at Â£10 it's a good buy."
10770,3373,5," Ahhh.  .  .I can see their faces now.  .  .it's 5am on a mid week morning and not a sound can be heard& they're in a deep sleep. He's dreaming about another Everton win& she's dreaming of winning the Great British Bake off& then  *boom*.  .  .  .Cue my 3 year old nephew blasting revellie out to waken his mum and dad up like some crazed version of a bootcamp Dizzy Gillespie!*all together now*You've got to get upYou've got to get upYou've got to get up this morning You've got to get upYou've got to get upGet up with the bugler's callThe major told the captainThe captain told the sergeantThe sergeant told the bugler andThe bugler told them all!Yes! I've bought this as a Christmas present for my 3 year old nephew. I'm nice like that :)  It's not that bad to be honest and quite a pleasant sound.Made by Bontempi whom have been making home musical instruments for over 50 years& this little trumpet should be quite good. At 14.5 inches long its not a bad size. It is plastic with a nice silver finish. There are four colour coded keys which play only one note each so simple tunes can be played. There is one colour coded song printed on the back of the box. It would've been nice to have a little booklet provided with a handful of songs I thought but I suppose it can be fun to work simple tunes out yourself.I wouldn't say the build quality is brilliant but adequate. It shouldn't be too easy to break unless really bashed on purpose. A normal drop and it'll be fine. Getting a note out of it is easy enough& just blow and hold one or more of the buttons/keys down.This is perfect to introduce a child to a wind/brass instrument as its inexpensive and not a big deal if they don't take to it. As long as they enjoy it and just march about playing the trumpet its all good for me!"
10771,3373,2," When this item arrived in a big box well packaged I thought wow this is going to be good& when I opened it the trumpet was very flimsy looks like it could brake if a child uses it& for Â£16 I thought it would of been made a bit stronger as it is for a child."
10772,3373,5," My 2& 3 year olds love instruments! I was given vocuhers to buy them some online and was thrilled to see that I could afford to buy quite a few. Prices are brilliant. My son loves to play with it. It was hard to play one of the buttons at first& but after a few weeks we didn't notice. It didn't always play the note.It is a great addition to our musical collection!"
10773,3374,5," Perfect"
10774,3374,5," Good quality and really cheap :)"
10775,3374,4," brill"
10776,3374,5," Great"
10777,3375,5," Used for our aunt's special 100th birthday party.  Made the party room look very special and very worthwhile buying.  Thank you"
10778,3375,5," I was able to decorate the room using different sections of this banner"
10779,3375,5," As shown. No complaints."
10780,3375,5," Perfect!!"
10781,3376,5," Arrived quickly& price as in shops really [Colchester doesnt really cater for boys birthdays]. Not too flimsey as we have passed it on to friends to use for their children."
10782,3377,3," Looked fine for the job& but I feel the wording is badly done as it seems to suggest that there are three banners per pack 'Party Wall Banner 3 Banners'? I thought I had 6 as I ordered two packs but just had 2. Therefore the price was not great and I could have bought cheaper locally."
10783,3377,5," Instant sparkly decor that can make all the difference"
10784,3377,5," does what its meant to"
10785,3378,5," Did exactly what I needed also gave me three banners out the one very durable I would recommend them to people"
10786,3378,5," Very good"
10787,3379,5," Banners does what thay should do"
10788,3379,5," fab"
10789,3380,5," Great quality and good customer service"
10790,3380,5," Great quality and what I expected"
10791,3380,5," Prompt delivery good priduct"
10792,3380,5," As expected and really long."
10793,3381,5," love it"
10794,3382,5," Very nice banner!"
10795,3382,5," Very nice banner"
10796,3383,5," Qulity that is expected. Did the job. Very happy"
10797,3384,5," This came faster than expected and just what i was expecting they are great quality and will look great with everything else football for my sons 6th birthday thank you will deffo order again"
10798,3384,5," Good quality& nice bright colours. Wish I had bought more now. May be re-usable if taken down carefully. Good product."
10799,3384,5," Arrived so fast and was perfect for my 9 year olds football party. His friends and he loved it!"
10800,3384,4," Brought for my sons football party& fitted with the theme very well"
10801,3384,4," looked good& longer than expected so cut in half"
10802,3384,5," Exactly as described - very happy birthday boy."
10803,3384,3," Just what I needed but came too late to use"
10804,3384,5," Great size. Speedy delivery. Looked great"
10805,3385,5," As described"
10806,3386,4," Good for a banner"
10807,3387,5," A 60th wedding anniversary is a rare event and I was delighted that I could find this banner to use at our celebrations. Arrived quickly"
10808,3387,5," Very lovely diamond wedding anniversary banner. I was so pleased to find this product after hunting the high street  to  no avail I was giving up hope of finding one."
10809,3387,5," I enjoy having this banner for my Mum and dad's 60th Wedding Anniversary.  The fact that it was silver and diamond it was good for their Diamand Wedding Anniversary."
10810,3387,4," Very good length. Unfortunately the light reflection meant the wording was not as clear as I would have liked.  But pleased with the item."
10811,3387,5," Still to use them but was very impressed when i looked at them will let you know what people think in APRIL"
10812,3387,5," Product just as described.  I should have bought two though& because once you've got a 9 ft banner up& it doesn't look as long as that!  So I would recommend that a couple would be likely to show up better (depending on where you put it of course!).  But it was a nice addition to put outside the house on a special day."
10813,3387,4," Banner was faulty in places but the overall effect was OK.Writing was difficult to see in places because of reflections but when cut into smaller lengths it not only provided a good border for a smaller photographic banners but also looked good on the outside cover of a photo album."
10814,3387,4," A lovely banner which can be cut and split to get more coverage.  The only downside is that& as the lettering is in silver& the banner has to be carefully placed so that the words can be read."
10815,3388,5," Bought this for a friends surprise party& which looked lovely when the room was decorated& and she was very surprised"
10816,3389,4," Not used them yet but had a look& they are very girlie know my wee girl will be happy with them for her party."
10817,3389,5," It is what it is a banner came quicker than estimted so arrived b4 my daughters birthday thanks"
10818,3389,3," Even though I received the balloons on time some of them had holes and didn't blow up as much."
10819,3389,4," As expected& we used as 3 small banners but can be used as one large."
10820,3390,4," A little flimsy but did the job a treat. My little girl thought they were fantastic and kept screaming for them every time they got her attention."
10821,3390,5," Very happy with this item. Arrived quickly and sufficiently. A**"
10822,3391,4," This purple banner was a lovely blue colour. Seller apologised and sent another. Excellent customer setvice. Second banner was an equally beautiful shade of blue. Used anyway. Nice and long and sparkly with good printing"
10823,3391,3," Arrived on time... But it's more of a blue than a purple background.....I had no choice but to use it as I had no time to re order!"
10824,3391,5," It is more blue than purple but I was doing purple and blue theme any way but it looks fab well worth the money you get 4 banners"
10825,3391,2," Product says purple background& but background looks blue not purple - so didn't match with the rest of the decorations"
10826,3391,5," My mum loved these purple is her favourite colour. They look really nice just not as bright a purple as the pic."
10827,3391,5," Lovely banner which enhanced the purple theme for my granddaughters 16th birthday."
10828,3391,5," bRILL COLOURS VERY UNUSUAL"
10829,3391,3," it was okie very ideal"
10830,3392,5," Was pleased to find this on Amazon as& despite the fact that so many live to 100 these days& there is a dearth of items for parties for people over 70 in the shops.  This banner was big and strong and looked great on the wall at my dad's 90th party."
10831,3392,5," My mum loved this banner able to cut it and display in her living room. Really helped with the birthday celebrations!"
10832,3392,5," The banner was great - I actually used it as 3 separate banners for a small room by cutting into 3 and worked well. Stuck a photo (close-up) of dad at 90 at each end- looked terrific along the mantelpiece."
10833,3392,5," These banners are very strong and well worth the money they were used for mother's 90th party and then again for a meal we did for her& they are still going strong. Yes I would recommend them"
10834,3392,5," Banners came when they said they would& I think they came the next day.My dad had them in his room& after they were at his party.thank you"
10835,3392,5," Good item for birthday celebrations& brightens up the dullest of spaces.Colourful and robust& what more can I say about this item."
10836,3392,5," Bought these for my mother's birthday lunch and they were perfect. Not too big but adequate for the purpose of the day."
10837,3392,5," Nice and bright - good size for our fairly large room when stretched out but would look equally good in smaller space."
10838,3393,5," i love it will look good"
10839,3394,5," great design"
10840,3395,5," Good value for money"

10842,3397,3," There is no a lot you can say about this item it is made from card board and will do the job but don't expect it to last very long"
10843,3397,1," This banner arrived with the A missing from Happy most disappointed."
10844,3397,5," Very very pretty! Looks wonderful hung up over Easter."
10845,3397,5," Good value with quick delivery"
10846,3398,4," These arrived very quickly and are of good quality& they will need to be laid flat before I use them as bit 'curled up' after being posted. Very happy with the service....Thanks"
10847,3398,4," This does exactly what it says on the tin - It would have been great if it was a little bit longer - but it looked good on the door for our daughters 4th birthday party!"
10848,3398,5," This item arrived the very next day and is really good quality just as it says 4th birthday banner Thank you"
10849,3398,5," Just what I needed for my daughters 4th birthday the banner was cheap and lovely too so thank you very much"
10850,3398,5," great item& very pretty and easy to cut so i can space out. will get more for my other childrens birthdays."

10859,3403,5," Perfect for making a 3rd birthday statement& this was long enough to cut into 2 sections making it excellent value for money"
10860,3403,5," well worth money and would be buying from again when needed. I found these pretty strong and lasted far longer"
10861,3403,3," Pretty disappointed it only said happy 3rd and not happy 3rd birthday!"
10862,3404,5," Lovely banner it has to be my fave baby shower range that's available right now. Sometimes it's nice to break down the blues with some lighter colors for boy decorations! I purchased other products from this range which were all just as lovely to look at."
10863,3404,5," Speedy delivery... Goes well with our other bits for baby shower"
10864,3404,5," Really effective"

10883,3411,4," As expected"
10884,3412,5," Great price and my 8yo enjoyed naming the countries according to their flags. We even looked up some of them in the atlas so educational too :-) We coped without the Uraguay flag - decided it wasn't necessary to pay an extra Â£3ish for the correct / full set form another seller. 19 of the 20 nations at the price I paid served us extremely well and added a bit of fun to the RWC2015."
10885,3412,5," Great- brightened up the office at work- everyone (who likes rugby) loves them"
10886,3412,5," Really made a great impact on my business as if we were totally involved"
10887,3412,5," As described great price too"
10888,3413,4," It was great apart from one balloon had a hole in it. But good quality balloons put them outside in howling gales and not one of the ones we had left burst in fact we had to put a hole in them to deflate them"
10889,3413,5," Brilliant balloons bought for my daughters 18th she loved them. Really big balloons and stay up for ages"
10890,3413,5," Exactly what I wanted thank you very much excellent service and delivered on time"

10894,3416,5," My 8 year old loves this item and is very pleased with her purchase.  Well made and helps complete her set"
10895,3417,4," Back in the 1980s when Transformers began& there was a character called Hound who was the Autobot scout type character.  He had highly advanced sensor detection systems within himself and he loved learning of Earth's culture.Also another character was introduced& though he didn't relaly get a general speaking part until Beast Wars over ten years later.  The character was Ravage& a Decepticon spy who turned into an audio cassette and slotted into Soundwave's chest compartment.Hound was never really seen again after the 80s until the Alternators/Binal Tech lines came and he received a 21st century remake in the form of& well& a jeep.He would later receive another version& again as a jeep& in the second release of the Classics/Universe line as a Legends class and now he's back once again& as a jeep& and as a deluxe.  And Ravage comes with him.So jeep and kitty for the price of the jeep& not bad.  So on with the review:Hound alt mode:  This mode is mostly in one colour& a mid coloured green.  The small hatch where his windscreen is attached is a lighter shade of green.  Other colours used are a small red for the AUtobot symbol on the front& a gun grey front roll bar& a black used for the front grill& under carridge& wheels& back seats& which aren't even seats& tabs on the back and dashboard.A dark green is used at the back behind the seats& the seat themselves are white& the two main ones anyway. And the side skirts are a gun grey& the windscreen is tinted a soft blue as are his headlights with a little yellow on the indicator lights on the front and red used for the brake lights on the back& his weapon/hologram projector is a light green and silver.The colours work well for this mode and the mode looks great.Read more â€º"
10896,3417,5," Missed out a few times getting this but I love the character so when this came up I knew I had to nab it. Little more expensive than what I usually pay but for a toy that's hard to find on these shores& it's worth the money for a die hard Transformers fan."
10897,3418,5," Sits in the van agreeing with everything I say.Gets a bit annoyed at speed bumps.Far better at map reading than the wife.Perfect."
10898,3418,5," I am absolutely delighted with the Stormtrooper  & larger than I expected& approx 7 inches& looking forward to collecting the rest."
10899,3418,5," If you're a Star Wars fan you will love it! Happy with the size as well - others i found online were too small."
10900,3418,5," Now in my collection on my desk& very chuffed and he bobbles like no ones business. happy days"
10901,3418,4," Its ok but we have chosen not to put it in the car as its a bit big for the dashboard"
10902,3418,5," I was really pleased with the storm trooper& it is well made and good fun."
10903,3419,5," Hasbro contnue to celebrate Star Wars 30th Anniversary with the next in the vehicle assortment - Darth Maul's Sith Infiltrator. This is the first time this ship has ever been issued and it was worth the wait.The ship comes disassembled in the box but takes moments to snap together.IT features an opening cockpit with room for Darth Maul& deployable landing gear and spring open wings which can be folded back for landing.Although this is not seen in the film& the front hull also opens into 'attack mode'. The side panels open to each side and reveal concealed missile launchers. There are 2 missiles provided which are actually Sith Probe Droids - which is a nice touch.The paint and detailing on the hull makes it very much like it's on-screen counterpart& even if it is about 30% too small.A great ship and a must for any Dark Side collection."
10904,3420,4," Very quick delivery& well packaged and just what my boys wanted! Thank you!"
10905,3420,5," Amazing& great value as they roughly Â£10 each. Packed well. Quick delivery"
10906,3421,5," Excellent"
10907,3422,5," I am very pleased with my purchase it came earlier than expected looking forward to maybe seeing a wave action figure of the Saracen from terror of the zygons  would like to buy from culture shock again"
10908,3422,5," Yet another figure....but warmly welcomed by the young Dr Who fan who received it!"
10909,3422,5," great item fast delivery"
10910,3422,4," good"
10911,3423,5," Very good"
10912,3424,5," Please do not buy this toy thinking it is the Autobot 'Ironhide'. Closer examination will reveal to you that it is in fact the Decepticon 'Megatron'.Somebody has very cleverly (sarcasm intended) labelled this item as 'Ironhide' when you can clearly see that"
10913,3424,5," Which toy is this. Megatron or Ironhide? I REALLY wanna know! I mean i LOVE how voyager Ironhide looks but i wanna be sure about what i'm buying!"
10914,3425,5," perfect conditions& no complaints at all"
10915,3426,5," As I said it's an ultimate lego. You don't have to have an engineering degree to build it but after you build it you will have a feeling that you have one.Spent app.7 hours on it.It's worth it guys. Be ready to be patient and accurate."
10916,3427,5," As a collectable figure I am very impressed with the quality of McFarlane toys. Great detail and the extras are equally good. Recommended for those keen on starting or adding to a collection."
10917,3427,5," Very cool figure....no pun intended considering he has been burnt to crisp and looks like over done crackling wrapped in bacon."
10918,3427,5," love the sculpt and especially when you hold it to a light.I may buy a few more.Money well spent."
10919,3428,4," this was bought as a present for my nephew who had spotted this in the catalogue and popped it on his Santa List.  The set is well made and detail good.  He has collected the other sets too now.  not too many small accessories so suitable for smaller children of 3 and 4 years old."
10920,3428,5," I bought this for my nephew for Christmas with another set and he plays with them all the time. So much so that I am going to buy another set for his birthday. :-)"
10921,3428,4," The gift was received with pleasure by the recipient. It was something he had requested from Father Christmas and added to his playmobil collection"
10922,3428,5," Prompt delivery& as always not disappointed with playmobil& had a very happy little boy on Xmas day ðŸ‘"
10923,3429,5," COOL AUTOBOT"
10924,3429,5," awesome"
10925,3430,5," Excellent"
10926,3431,5," My son loves anything to do with Ben 10. He liked this when he had it but it has fallen out of favour. it doesn't do much more than launch a car across the floor& but it does it well."
10927,3431,3," Very small figure& but just what my son wanted apparently. It works well but seems a little flimsy. It launches well though."
10928,3432,5," The nendoroid of Golden Darkness from To Love Ru is perfect and spot on with the anime version of her& I would recommend this Nendoroid to any fan of the Anime"
10929,3432,4," The details they've put into this are really nice& they really shows Yami's characteristic displayed in the anime& really pleased."
10930,3433,1," I received this today for my daughter's birthday so I don't know what she'll think about the actual Moshi Monsters themselves but they look fine to me.My issue is that someone has already opened the packaging as mentioned in other reviews - in our case this isn't a problem as we're just starting our collection but I won't be buying any more from this seller - be warned that if you're hoping for a rare hidden moshi you're unlikely to get it here.This is not the standard I would usually expect when purchasing from Amazon."
10931,3433,3," Good product but as per previous feedback the packaging had been sliced open to check the secret moshling& very dissapointed."
10932,3433,1," Very annoyed that the packaging had been tampered with to see what the hidden figure was& I didn't look and don't know who/what the figures are& but I can guess that the fun secret Moshling isn't an |ultra rare|.I want a mint condition toy for my son which still holds the magic of the unknown surprise - after all this is a lot of money for tiny plastic figures the |value| therefore is in the surprise. Very disappointed and a hassle to have to return/complain."
10933,3433,5," My little granddaughter loves this. They are so little she puts them in her pocket and takes them everywhere. Instead of countering about being bored she gets them out and uses her imagination and plays for ages. A lovely present. Arrived I n good time too and in good condition so would buy from this seller again."
10934,3433,1," I am absolutely disgusted that the package has been tampered with to check if there is a rare moshling figure behind the covered part.  know have to return item as was a present."
10935,3433,5," As previously arrived in good time and was well packed.It was part of the set I sent for for my grandson and he was well pleased with all of them."
10936,3433,5," A great Xmas present for my Grand Daughter& I would recommend it for a Birthday or Xmas present& she still plays with now."
10937,3433,4," Just a quick line to say was very pleased with service response. Ordered Monday afternoon - arrived Tuesday's post! Can't get better than that: these Moshi figures are all the rage at the moment with our grand-children (age 5+ and 7+) so they were very pleased to find them here when they came over this afternoon.Martin."
10938,3434,5," I bought this for my boyfriends birthday who loves Tomb Raider and he was after buying a statue but they were all very expensive and in the U.S in $ but this statue was a great price so I went for it and it arrived quickly the box& and packaging all in great condition. This statue feels well-made and the colours are great too. Very pleased!"
10939,3434,5," nice little item& feels well made and sturdy and very good detail for the price. Great addition to any game room"
10940,3434,4," Happy with the product perfect shelf size and didn't take too long to deliver"
10941,3435,5," My grandson absolutely loves these Moshi Monsters!  They were an extra present from Santa under the Christmas Tree! Good buy."
10942,3435,5," A lovely little stocking filler for Christmas& the kids loved them.  Well packaged  and at a great price too. 5*"
10943,3435,5," Arrived promptly very pleased.Minor point - overly large packaging for small item."
10944,3435,5," Another Moshi for the collection. when will it stop!"
10945,3435,5," This item was sent out very promptly and arrived in time as it was a present.  Very pleased with product"
10946,3436,5," i bought this for my nephew& hoping that he will play with this instead of my grown up toys.I have been playing with it so much i dont think its going to have any power for him to see it light up by the time i give it to him.Its so cool i want to keep it and not tell him i bought it lol"
10947,3436,5," The USS Enterprise Plush is great!  My little boy carries it around everywhere and even sleeps with it.  Lucky for us he hasn't quite worked out how to fire the phasers so some relative peace and quiet...for now.  Great toy& highly recommend it.  Delivered quickly with no hassle."
10948,3436,4," As far as being a plush toy great n indestructible. As for knowing what on earth it is supposed to be without the words on it would disappoint grown men. My one yr old likes the flasshing lights. Think first who ure buying for.came in good time though."
10949,3436,5," Well I don't love it& but my trekie brother certainly does!Don't really know what else to say& the geek loves it so it must be good!"
10950,3437,5," What can I say &it's Iron Man :)love it in flying mode&brilliant figure &only one problem &only one set of wrist joints for four different hands &if you lose one &you're  stuffed !"
10951,3437,5," Very good. im Happy with my purchased."
10952,3438,4," My son and I were very pleased with the Predator Bad Blood Figurine& it was exactly as advertised.  Would recommend this item."
10953,3438,5," Fantastic figure to add to collection very detailed paintwork is excellent.....a must buy!!! looks exactly like picture shown in description"
10954,3438,5," Absolutely brilliant figure captures exactly what the Predator is anout"
10955,3439,5," my grandson loves it& he bought it by doing odd jobs to buy it bless him"
10956,3440,4," Good points:Strong build quality (robust)Great soundLooks good in the dark because it lights upVery accurate modeling of handleLightweightCame in just over a week - very good considering that's Japan ~ BritainBad points:The saber only folds in 2 pieces so you will always have about 30cm of the blade sticking out. I think this could have been put forward better in the description/photos. Though not too much of a problem it does make it a bit bulky to carry around with a costume if going to events such as comicon&Also the button that activates lights and sounds is very easy to accidentally press and could be a bit more rigid. However I know that the company don't make the product& they only supply it& so this can't be changed.The blade is a little shorter than expected& but it is a toy so that's fair enough.All in all I am very pleased. If you're living in Britain and on a budget for your Qui Gon Jinn costume I recommend this lightsaber as it's relatively cheap and good fun to use"
10957,3440,5," Great quality my son loved it."
10958,3440,5," Great light sabre. Every boys dream."
10959,3441,4," Bought this as a gift for a yound comic book fan& an excellent reproduction of a classic character from the 'X-men' series. The detail in the product for the size is good quality and is styled as if it has been lifted from the page.Colossus was largely overlooked in the movie run& but fans of the comic books and kids alike will love this version of the hard hitting russian mutant.A good edition to an iconic collection."
10960,3442,5," Looks really great& good likeness and quality."
10961,3443,4," Missing the blue eyes& but still great!"
10962,3444,5," This is one of my favourites from the 3.75| inch line& and I much prefer it to the Build-a-weapon Kylo. The armour isn't great& but the figure itself looks fantastic& and the details make it feel good quality."
10963,3445,5," Glad Mego re-released these super rare Trek figures!"
10964,3446,5," Exactly what I wanted. Two very good Playskool Marvel figures& up to the usual standard with good arm articulation and solid legs allowing young children to enjoy Marvel fun. My son loves these& can the Web Slinger win this battle?"
10965,3446,5," Lovely well made product. These are my sons favourite characters so wents down a storm when he opened them on his birthday!!"
10966,3446,5," My little one loves these. Impressed with the movement these tiny figures have"
10967,3446,1," Really not what I wanted so disappointed"
10968,3447,5," Love it!"
10969,3448,5," Decent quality& attractiv&  functional item. Great price at time of purchase."
10970,3449,5," Series 3 of the Doctor Who action figures continues with this excellent reproduction of a Judoon Trooper.The figure comes in a great black finish and lots of detailing on the costume and like the latest wave of figures& it is really poseable with shoulder& elbow& wrist& waist& hip& knee and leg movement.The trooper comes equipped with a blaster - which fits into the holster fixed on the belt& a translator and a scanner - both of which attach to small holes in the belt.The only drawback to the figure is that you can't remove the helmet and it doesn't move at all but that's only a small quibble.All in all& an excellent and accurate figure and keids will deinitely need several to recreate those moments from Smith And Jones. Look out for the Judoon Captain to go with the troops."
10971,3449,3," Expensive for what it is I thought& when you consider added postage& which I never seem to benefit from free super saver delivery..Well made looks good in the display cabinet surrounded by cybermen&daleks&Tadis and Dr 5| figures.My boy loves it."
10972,3449,3," A good figure that gives one a sense of the threat fullness of the characters in Dr Who. No weapon but it was second hand."
10973,3449,5," As expected"
10974,3450,5," It looks great against my black door. Really good quality. Fantastic present for a Tim Burton or Nightmare Before Christmas fan."
10975,3450,1," Looked fan static to start with but not after a few months! Regular cleaning/polishing/drying and it's mounted under a lean-too away from the elements yet it's still rusted really badly. Shame as it's looked great at first."
10976,3450,5," This is a very nicely-made door knocker. It looks great against our glossy black door! :) Very heavy and feels to be of good quality. I'd recommend it if you want your door to stand out!"
10977,3450,5," Really good gift idea. Quality of the product was excellent."
10978,3451,4," This was bought some time ago for my 8 yr old son and put aside for Christmas (yesterday).  He was originally more interested in the Spartan JFO figure than the rocket launcher.  However& with my finding a Warthog for him to attach it to it became an even better buy.The figure itself is up to the usual standard with steel and blue paintwork that is made to look suitably weathered and the normal amount of articulation for the Halo Reach range of figures. Note.  This figure does not come with any personal weapons.The rocket launcher fits into the warthog with no problems and turns easily in 360 degrees.  Again the weathering is well done.  Both sets of tubes can be moved up and down& with enough room between the two sets of launch tubes for the Spartan to stand but the grips for the operator to hold appear very flimsy and are too close together for the figure to get a good grip due to the design of his hands.  To get your figure to have any type of grip you have to place his arms close in to his body with his hands nearly touching.  It helps to have the nearest launch tube turned upwards to give you more space.  It can be done but it is a bit fiddly.  Such an oversight detracts from what is for the most part a well thought out item.How durable this item will be depends on how its going to be used.  If It's going to be played with then depending on how rough someone is I suspect the grips will be the first things to break.  As to how good a buy it is& then that depends on what disposable income you have& what price you can get it for& and of course& how much you want it.  I think I paid between Â£12 and Â£15 for this at the time along with the canon and operator at just under Â£10 with free p"
10979,3451,5," well it's cool and made okthough I'd recommend the bigger 50 pound cannons for your warthogHOWEVER : after buying a dozen packs - from different series and sellers I can safely say that no two packs even similar are of the same quality.in my moongose gang - 3 - I have seriously different qualitys.I also keep them as models not toys so they should last longer."
10980,3451,5," We bought one of these for our son and he loved it so much that we bought another& this one& as a gift for a friend.  Our so was 8 when we bought it but we bought it for a 12 year old.  He loved it.  Our son needed a bit of help but it was good fun and easy enough to get stuck into."
10981,3451,5," This was purchased for a young enthusiast and meets with his full approval. It is his favourite toy and complements the Master Chief Action Figure."
10982,3452,4," This toy is a vast improvement to the old version of these transforming toys and more simpler too. The paintjob is slightly different to the reissue but it reminiscent of the image of how Starscream looked in the cartoons& the wings are higher on his back& rather than 'slouched' lower in the reissue/G-1 for example he is also smaller than the original but that is overlooked due to the detail of the toy."
10983,3453,3," Quite small.did think they would be a bit bigger.okay for the price.work nice for Little stocking fillers for christmas."
10984,3453,5," My son has lots of the half shell heroes toys. Very pleased with the quality. He loves them."
10985,3453,5," Good value. My 5yr old son will be really pleased with these. Cant wait for christmas day."
10986,3453,5," Sturdy little figures. My 5 year old has added these to his turtle collection& loves them."
10987,3453,3," Not sure these are worth the price for just one figure but they are pretty durable"
10988,3453,1," Supposed to be pack of 2 i only recieved 1"
10989,3453,5," Excellent product& my 5 year old loves it"
10990,3453,3," Smaller than expected but looks good"
10991,3454,5," This is possibly the best Optimus Prime figure I have! Very detailed& very articulated& and extremely accurate to the CGI model! Would recommend this to anyone that looks for accuracy in figures!"
10992,3454,5," My son loves it already in a glass case"
10993,3455,5," come fast no damage"
10994,3456,5," Excellent quality!! fantastic figure! I think this figure is the best one I have got! and i decided to buy Homura 'you are not alone' ver. as well after purchasing this ~ so good!"
10995,3456,5," I bought this as a gift for my soon to be husband and its fantastic. Brilliant condition and easy to assemble."
10996,3456,5," this figure is fantastic the detail is brilliant  so happy i got this figure wow i really do love it"
10997,3457,5," excellent condition"
10998,3458,1," Still not the right product I was after the one that had the spider in it not happy he's had this one now he's had it again not happy"
10999,3458,5," They arrived super quick. Got them for my goddaughter's birthday& I don't have a clue about mine craft but she seemed overjoyed!"
11000,3458,5," My son loves these and plays with them often"
11001,3458,5," Great my little boy loves them"
11002,3458,5," Just as expected"
11003,3459,5," It is an extremely accurate reproduction. The face is exact. Articulation is done in such way that even the character of Adam Jensen is captured i.e. you can pose him exactly as see him in the game. As a trade off the joints are not as tight as you may expect& but my version has no problem posing/standing.See video reviews and get creative! This one is a gem."
11004,3459,3," The item arrived quickly. As this will be a Christmas gift for my son its impossible to rate at the moment& although I was horrified that such a small figure would be so expensive(and not in its original packaging)."
11005,3460,5," GREAT !"
11006,3461,5," Great figurine& posable with lots of detail. Arrived on time."
11007,3462,5," We purchased this for our wedding day to stand guard over the cake. It was easy to assemble and looked great.Highly recommend."
11008,3462,5," Been stood proudly in our living room for a year now! Goes by the name 'Harold'"
11009,3462,5," Great fun item - who can't love a 6ft storm trooper!"
11010,3462,5," Very good and looks real and keeps me company at night and it guards my room in the day and got here in time and very good service and great price and I would recommend to a anyone who is a fan of Star Wars"
11011,3462,5," Our son loved this cut out &. A Christmas present that  gave him the Wow!!! factor"
11012,3462,5," Exactly as expected very pleased with the product& packing and delivery"
11013,3462,5," Nice and sturdy& easy to assemble. Made a great Christmas present."
11014,3462,5," Excellent quality life sized cut out. Very happy with it."
11015,3463,5," One of my nephews must haves on his Xmas list he absolutely loves it! Good buy for any star wars fan."
11016,3464,4," So this is the latest Episode II Anakin figure and I think it is the best one out there. The last Anakin Episode II figure (that I have) was an Evolutions repack in the Legacy collection& and while I liked that one& this one is the definitive figure of the character to date.I had actually been waiting for a more modern Ep II Anakin figure for quite some time& and this figure doesn't disappoint.The good points: Excellent articulation& great detail& And the interchangeable human-to robotic hands' is a nice feature retained from past Anakin figures.The only gripe I have is that there is no Lightsaber Hilt to attach to his peg on his midsection& an obvious oversight that Hasbro is becoming more and more known for.But overall& a very nice figure.9/10"
11017,3464,5," Great toy"
11018,3465,5," love these figures love the hideously deformed &symmetrically challenged clown.and of course harley girloutfit's not as good as asylum but it still rocks"
11019,3466,5," Great fun"
11020,3467,5," My grandson will love it"
11021,3467,5," Nephew loved it !"
11022,3468,5," My grandson loved it"
11023,3469,5," Very cool Cyberman - the corrosion is effective and makes the thing look very real and spooky. My three-year old loves playing with this. The limb articulations are pretty good. There are lots of different Cyberman designs ranging across the years - I think this is one of the best."
11024,3469,5," good value"
11025,3469,4," It's a Cyberman& still in box& a present for Christmas so hoping it will be a welcome"
11026,3470,5," My 6 year old son bought this from pocket money and loved it! Perfect!"
11027,3471,5," The quality is very good and the design is excellent. I have it on my works bag as it is too long to go on the car keys.Highly recommend for the serious Thrones fan."
11028,3472,5," A great item for Star Wars collectors or for kids who like reenacting Star Wars episodes. Well made with fantastic details."
11029,3472,5," My grandson was over the moon with this and plays with it a lot of the time.  I also bought a few other fitures so he is having great fun."
11030,3473,4," Really good& this is my first Play Arts Kai and I really liked how easy it was to pose her and the stand really helps if you want to go for more action orientated poses. The Quality is great and her likeness is incredible.Deducted 1 star because it would've been better if her hips had a better joint. I don't know if this is a Play Arts Kai thing but it's a shame I can't angle her more to the right or left."
11031,3474,5," My son received this for xmas and it was a huge hit! He still plays with it& which is a good sign. I think it was a bit expensive for what it was& but then something is only worth what your willing to pay for it and on this occassion& he wanted it so I got it. It arrived quickly and was well packaged."
11032,3474,2," It doesn't do alot- you can't get the figure out of the vehicle and basically converts to an open glider position showing batman inside. My 5 year old was a little disappointed that the figure is ''STUCK''! I think the imaginext bat would've been a much better buy."
11033,3474,5," Great toy"
11034,3475,5," Great price at the time of ordering (Â£6.99)& great detail and articulation....Little person loves him!!.Incidentally& I got all the other figures in this particular range from Smyths Toys for a dealtastic Â£6.99 each too. All the other figure are more expensive from Amazon :O(. If they the same price& then I would have ordered them through the world of Amazon of course.By the way& with each figure ordered you get a piece of a crazy large Green Goblin / Hulk hybrid. The figure when complete look great& although some of the pieces where incredibly hard to join together!!!Hope this review helps and happy shopping."
11035,3475,4," Great figure however mine had a few one-off QC issues& namely some messy paint which wasn't entirely noticeable& however a slightly more drastic issue (which keeps this from going to a 5/5) is the seam along the left side of the torso was not sealed& nothing some super glue didn't fix. I really wouldn't let these QC issues put you off such a great figure as& given the great track record I've had with Marvel Legends Figures& I believe this a problem to only affect mine."
11036,3475,4," The articulation is fantastic. You can get it in a lot of different poses! It's also a nice looking figure but the gauntlets and spider arms are missing. I would've appreciated some wall-crawling hands as well and the right knee joint was stuck when it arrived. Overall& though& I recommend this figure highly if your a collector or someone looking for a gift for their kid."
11037,3475,5," Sons loved the spiderman(oldest) Batman(youngest) figures. The only thing about the spiderman is when my son came to change the hand it popped out all the way so& i'm not sure if its broken because the orignal hands(shown in photo) slots back in fine but the web sling hands do not???"
11038,3475,5," Great Superior spiderman figure& has great articulation and can do many poses."
11039,3476,5," Package came and was in a good condition. It is an official Minecraft Hanger."
11040,3477,3," I bought this box for my 6 year old Grandson along with some Bakugan balls&I did not think the box was worth the Â£[]& but mt Grandson loves it& and has all his Bakugan stored& the space for the Bakugan cards though is not very good& when you shut the box the cards fall out (we had to put elastic bands around the box& also the triangler shaped Bakugan are awkward to fit in the box"
11041,3477,5," perfect for storing ball and squared shaped bakugan& not suitable for the most recent shapes (triangles& cylinders). looking for most recent case."
11042,3477,3," I agree with the comment that it is not worth the money. I am quite dissapointed with it& its smaller than I imagined and see through (similar size to a kids lunchbox is the best description I can think of). I should have looked into the specifications before buying."
11043,3477,3," I bought this for a Bakugan obsessed 9 year old's birthday! It is a compact sturdy case to house all those other fiddly bits of Bakugan. It's not that big and really not worth over Â£10 but he is happy!"
11044,3478,4," This is an excellent figure that brilliantly captures a key look for Stormtroopers from the original Star Wars movie! Fantastic articulation and a nice set of accessories including: Imperial Staff& shoulder pad& blaster& removable belt cannister& figure stand"
11045,3479,5," Very pleased with this item."
11046,3479,5," Excellent."
11047,3480,5," Cool!"
11048,3481,3," I bought this figure as a Christmas present for my daughter as she loves Batgirl. Although the figure does look fantastic we did have a problem when she came to open the packaging. Unfortunately due to the way the figure is packaged with the Cape slotted through a plastic backing& while trying to remove it Batgirl's head fell off!! How about that then. To me this was caused by the way it was packaged and a lack of good glue to the shoulder and neck joining. That said with some good strength glue we soon sorted the problem out. However to be fair this really isn't what you would expect from a figure that is brand new and not even out of the box so to speak. If you do happen to purchase the figure I would recommend being really careful when removing the figure from the packaging. Other than this my daughter loves the figure."
11049,3481,5," I bought this for my daughter who is superhero mad and she loves it& it is recommended for years 8+ but she was 4 when I bought it because there are no other batgirl figures available.  I told her to be careful with it and she's been fine.  It came with tiny baterangs which we have now lost because they are so small they could have easily gone in the Hoover without noticing.  She now has the Wonder Woman too"
11050,3481,5," It's a girl and a bat and a superhero and a toy. Every 4 year olds dream."
11051,3481,5," bought for a 4 yr old girl. She absolutely loved it."
11052,3482,5," Super quick no issues"
11053,3483,4," After years of trying to get hold of the Bruticus Maximus set from the Transformers Energon series& finally found this beaut on Amazon! And thanks to Toyz And Gamez& I finally got my mitts on it! Some of the coolest looking molds carried over from the energon toyline& the repainted Combaticons live again. Nice easy transformations& excellent detailing& lots of pick up n play potential in a great package set. One slight hiccup with the set I got was that Swindle has two right legs (insert two left feet joke here)& but seeing as how I already own a couple of the Energon combaticon helicopters& I should be able to get around this small detail! All in all& a fantastic set I can highly reccomend to anyone interested in Transformers!"
11054,3484,4," My parents purchased this for my sons 4th birthday as he loves batman. The bike was a bit of a puzzle to put together but once it's together it's fantastic fun for a 4 yr old. The wings"
11055,3484,5," It's true& he is obsessed with super heroes& and particularly Batman"
11056,3484,5," It is well made and detailed& and good value as it can be made into several different vehicles. Highly recommended."
11057,3484,5," Very much enjoyed by my nephew& spends a lot of time playing with his Batpod. He is into his batman toys and is building up a collection of them."
11058,3484,4," 4 year old son got this for his birthday and loves it. The missiles shoot quite a long way and as its brightly coloured it doesn't get lost easily. Great toy."
11059,3484,5," My son loves this it is great quality and can stand a lot of rough play my son likes to think batman destroys things by smashing into them"
11060,3484,5," My five year old son loves this and has played with it endlessly. Even my two year old daughter had a 'go' with it!"
11061,3484,5," Bought this for our Nephew who just turned 6. He's really in to Batman& Superman and super heroes alike& so we bought this for his Birthday. Not a bad little toy for the price& although I think you are paying for the 'Batman' label but lookalikes are 'just not the same'! Favourite part of the toy was definitely the gun bit& which fires out a small-ish plastic bullet. Would definitely recommend :)"
11062,3485,5," Nice looking pop& bought in order to do a custom repaint& turned him into John F. Kennedy (sort of)"
11063,3485,5," great"
11064,3486,5," my son loved it. played with it for two weeks now forgot it. not much more to say really.good though."
11065,3487,5," Happy little girl ðŸ‘"
11066,3488,5," Bought this for my Ewok loving 11 year old& its great and if you are a star wars fan of any age& I am pretty sure you will love it! Nice size& well boxed& good detail& well made."
11067,3488,5," I LOVE Ewoks& ever since I was little& and this little Wicket is SO cute!  Sweet little collectors item and/or gift :)"
11068,3488,5," This lil guy is so cute and was a hit for the birthday boy"
11069,3488,5," Adorable! I'm a star wars fan but this one would be great for anyone!I love how the Star Wars pop funkos actually have bobble heads!Paint is amazing on my one but they all vary! Love it!"
11070,3488,5," Bought for a friend who loves Star Wars and is nicknamed 'Ewok' because of his similarities to the movie character. He got a laugh out of it."
11071,3488,5," Excellent product ðŸ˜Š"
11072,3488,5," Brilliant quality love it very reasonable price and would make a great gift for any Star wars fan"
11073,3488,5," great item"
11074,3489,5," Can't go wrong with a Moshi monster- bought to replace the one he lost in Marks and Spencer! Kids eh?"
11075,3490,5," i ordered this product after my partners trip to Japan& being a huge iron man fan I had to have this in my collection& the product came fast considering it was from Japan& it was well packaged and came in perfect condition& the paint work on the figure itself is near perfection& I could not be happier& thank you very much for the tea& great little surprise."
11076,3491,4," Kids liked it. Not well made& comes apart easily but they clip it to the other bits and seem to like creating different arrangements"
11077,3491,4," very pleased grandson loves them plays with them all the time so much fun with all the funny wheelies etc"
11078,3491,5," Christmas present for my grandson. He loves it and has not stopped playing with it."
11079,3492,5," Love this Funko Pop Vinyl& it's a great quality collect able for any Star Wars fan. Bright colours and clearly well made item. Stands on its own 'Star Wars' labelled base but can be removed if you wanted. Will definitely be buying again!"
11080,3492,1," Purchased this cos it was the cheap and needed  R2-D2 for my collection& but & the paint quality was shocking...wasn't impressed with it even has a blue finger print on. The worse one I have received"
11081,3492,4," Came on expected date. Exactly as described by seller. The paint details doesn't look as good as it does in the picture but still happy with the product."
11082,3492,5," He's a bit smaller than the normal Pop figures& but that's because he is a bit smaller& so to be expected& but looks great and goes well next to C-3PO!"
11083,3492,5," Does exactly what I thought it would do when I bought it....nothing!Epic R2-D2 model& the best character in Star Wars"
11084,3492,5," Bought for my boyfriend now happily sits on his dashboard"
11085,3492,4," A great gift& though the packaging was a little damaged."
11086,3492,5," Goog product delivery times good"
11087,3493,5," I bought this as a gift for my husband (yes& he is an overgrown child) and he loved it - the tiny plastic Kraang is the icing on the cake! I would recomend this to anyone who has a son/brother/boyfriend/husband in need of their own awesome Kraang lab set!"
11088,3493,5," This is a lovely starter set to the lego ninja turtle sets. I can't wait to see my boys face on his birthday."
11089,3493,5," Normally hen you buy the lowest priced set in a particular themed Lego set you are left with a couple of figures and a soon to be forgotten set of bricks.With the TMNT entry level box you are getting more than what you normally would.A very cool Michaelangelo figure& but the best part is the awesome |The Kraang| figure. Also includes a foot soldier and small prison.I have no problems giving this set 5 stars."
11090,3493,5," Not a bad price as lego goes& arrived swiftly and as usual went down exceptionally well with my four year old son.  Turtle is well cute!"
11091,3493,4," Great present for a 6 years old and fantastic price a lot cheaper than in the hight street . ..."
11092,3493,2," This was bought as a gift. It was advertised as brand new however when the item arrived& the box was battered and the corners were dog eared. The contents inside were all fine and luckily it was for a 6 year old who wouldn't mind the box being battered& as I really would have returned this. But I did not have enough time to return and get another as birthday was 2 days& hence paying express delivery. Not impressed."
11093,3493,1," Very disappointed. Overpriced and fragile. My six year old son was SO excited to be receiving this for his birthday& however no sooner had he taken the bits out of the box then he discovered the Kraang lost an arm as he placed it in the mechanical walker. This is outrageously expensive for what you get (a tiny set).  We shall be very cautious in future."
11094,3493,2," Got this for my son who adores Lego. Compared to other sets this is possibly the most disappointing in terms of bricks to cash ratio. In fact i was shocked how small this set was for the price. Cute set but should be half the cost."
11095,3494,5," The 30th Anniversary collection pushed up the bar of excellent ideas and design of Star Wars figures in the late 2000's. Better articulation& finer detail& better packaging construction and card images made the TAC line a line to collect and keep on card& as I did and still have on card.One of the better things about the TAC was that accessories relevant to the character were supplied too& as in the case of this little Jawa figure& we also get another accessory / figure with the Jawa in the form of the LIN Droid as seen very briefly in Star Wars A New Hope. The Jawa figure is really nice& accurate and looks great on display with other Jawa's.With each numbered figure you get a coin too that fits into a carry folder that was available with the No1 figure of Empire Strikes Back Darth Vader."
11096,3494,5," Hasbro continue their 30th Anniversary Collection with figure #19: Jawa and LIN-V8K.A great double pack from A New Hope& the Jawa is one of the best versions of these pesky little scavengers to date. The arms on the Jawa have very positionable joints at hand& elbow and shoulder to allow for loads of poses. It comes complete with a blaster pistol& droid caller and a bandolier with slots for both pieces of equipment.The Jawa is also accompanied by LIN-V8K - a mine laying and demolitions droid. This droid comes with 2 antennae& a scanner and a multi-jointed arm which clips in the front.There is also a coin for the collector's album which comes with figure #1: Darth Vader.A great twin pack and a must have for all those who managed to get the Sandcrawler in 2004."
11097,3494,5," Very good product good value for money as stated fast delivery"
11098,3495,5," My little boy has wanted this figure for a while now as it was the only web battler he didnt have so he is very happy now thank you."
11099,3495,5," I paid a great price for this figure& and my son was made up with it!"
11100,3495,5," great buy&really pleased.."
11101,3495,5," My little boy desperately wanted a Green Goblin figure for his birthday and I scoured the shops in vain looking for one and to no avail. Luckily good old Amazon had one! He was ecstatic on the morning of his birthday& this was the only figure he had missing from his spiderman collection. The figure itself is of good quality and has an arm swinging action when its legs are pushed together& it is the same size as the other current spiderman figures in the shops such as Venom& Doc Ock etc. All in all& very pleased with this purchase."
11102,3496,5," new knight great detail. the kids are going have lot of fun with there new world of knights and fantasy"
11103,3496,5," When I saw this item I knew my child would love it.It has good detail and looks great.My kids have used similar products (a year) and they are still in one peace. However weapons have broken but still usable.The paint wares off especially on the sward after some time but that is due to kids putting it in the mouth.My kids love it"
11104,3496,4," Schleich do griffin knights and dragon nights they are all so lifelike I collect papo and schleich fantasy so they are all big hits for me"
11105,3496,4," Good quality and detail& nice gifts as part of a collection& best of what's available. A mite to pricey in my opinion but kids love them."
11106,3496,5," its a fair price for a static kids model looks pretty good and well made with good detail in the colours and fine painting work"
11107,3496,5," My grandson loves playing with knights and horses. The Schleich figurines are of good quality with a lot of details."
11108,3496,4," a good sturdy product that the children get much joy from& not cheap but somethings are worth paying for i think."
11109,3497,5," These figures are getting harder to find outside of the US.  Great addition to my grandchildrens collection.  Great for kids 4-10 years old."
11110,3498,3," As this is a non-specific character it's kind of a meh figure& but it is a necessity if you wish to complete your TMNT movie figures& and he does have a descent amount of articulation."
11111,3498,5," My son loved this foot soldier as soon as he opened it. Great purchase"
11112,3498,5," Son loves it!!"
11113,3498,5," Great item"
11114,3498,5," All good."
11115,3499,5," the quality of figure is very good."
11116,3500,4," This playmat arrived and was larger than i expected which was fantastic as it meant that my little 6yr old boy had loads of space to put all his dragons and dinosaurs on and still had space to move them about. Most other play mats are not big enough to set everything up on and still have room to move about. He also occasionally sets his castle up on the mat and still has room to play on it. The colours and attetion to detail on it are great too. Everytime he plays on it he notices another dragon& cave or something else that has been drawn onto the mat. We keep it out on the dinning room floor and you can hoover over it and it cleans up really well. We have had it over 3mths now and he plays with it most days. Hi s friends love it too."
11117,3500,5," Very different from the usual streets and buildings... Much more imaginative play on this!"
11118,3501,5," Excellent - received as promised in good condition"
11119,3502,4," kids love these and well worth buying"
11120,3503,5," bought as a gift much liked"
11121,3504,4," I'd like to make it clear that I haven't bought one of these characters from this seller.However I have been down to Forbidden Planet and out of about 6 Vaders they had& one of them actually talked as well as breathed.It does about 4 phrases.I noticed its labels were different and it had a different batch number so I bought it. It's number is 1110 101231.I couldn't tell you what the breathing-only ones number is.I also noticed out of the Yoda's& some just did a Yoda-esque growl and some said one phrase only.I've ordered a Yoda that apparently says multiple phrases so I'll update on that when it arrives.So it seems to me there have been some variations in versions of these characters& without notification.Possibly because of licensing complications& and it appears its the newer ones that have become less interesting.Anyway& thought I'd share my findings because I would be pretty miffed if I'd only got a growling Yoda or a breathing Darth."
11122,3504,3," I like this keyring. It's a good size and quite fun& seems well made and is a sort of cute Vader. But I wish I'd known its 'talking' was in fact just the Darth Vader 'breathing' sound. I did try to find out before I bought it but couldn't find the info anywhere. I thought it might 'say' a couple of Vader phrases& so was slightly disappointed it only snores. It's still good& but I would have liked to know it didn't actually 'talk'."
11123,3504,5," Had read the reviews about different versions of this item& but was pleasantly suprised that this one had the speaking phrases (wasn't expecting it!!)Bigger than expected but my son loves it!!"
11124,3504,4," bought for my 4 year old nephew who is a star wars freak and loves soft toys and this was a super-hit. He loves it. considering how little I paid& I'm very happy with the purchase."
11125,3504,5," I thought this was great& and the person I bought it for agreed. It was exactly what I was looking for& I would def recommend it for a joke or a present for any Star Wars fan."
11126,3504,4," Quick delivery& and a cute little toy for star wars geeks. Its more of just something to collect rather then to actually do much with. I just like buying this kind of stuff :)"
11127,3504,4," I think over all the key ring is pretty cool& but it onlt makes the sound of Darth's breathing and i thought i would have some of his catch phrases too."
11128,3504,5," Service provided good& I intend to buy the Yoda one as well...It's a bit big in size (expected it smaller) but other than that very satisfied!"
11129,3505,5," still cool  figure if kept in card!!!"
11130,3506,4," this is one of the best marvel selects i have seen. Decent articulation amazing paint detail really gives it that menacing look and comes with an amazing base however for every joy there is a trail the toy is covered in little plastic spikes they look dull but trust me and everyone else who bought this product they hurts and can be quite tricky to pose Anti-Venom is best described as a Rose. i rate this product 9/10"
11131,3506,5," Its not a gift for me but I certainly may be stealing this one!! It is just such good detail to the product& for all reviewers...this is NOT a model which I already knew& this is a poseable action figure which can stand as a model and still look just as good. Just great and for the price its such good value"
11132,3506,5," Brilliant figure. Very nice detailed display base. The figure can be tricky posing cause of the spiky points& but once posed it is really nice with the rest of my marvel select figures."
11133,3507,5," Ordered from Dream PlayHouse : An excellent figure that is purchased as desktop enhancer and one stop animation character. This in relation to the Motor bike Spride.07 that is also due to arrive that she sits on. The figure allows separate leg sections to sit on the bike and is jointed to allow full movements. Soft body bend at the hips that allows positioning. Head can be replaced with the helmet as seen held& along with a changing face if needed. The usual 4 pairs of hands for expression and alternative face. Well formed detailed desktop figure that is worthy of collection along with the bike. If anything the colour is not a true representation in that it is much darker than that depicted& not so much white as off white / grey and the hair is much darker.  It must be noted that the item was ordered on the 14 Sept and arrived on 23 Sept almost 3 weeks before expectation and a pleasant surprise."
11134,3508,5," Paid extra to arrive quickly which it did.  Perfect present for my nephew.  No complaints as far as I am aware."
11135,3509,5," As described"
11136,3510,5," I nearly skipped this figure& since I got the Dr Zauis from Series 1. Whilst I think it was an odd move to release two such similar figures within two waves& this second version of the good Doctor is completely different& and in my opinion& superior.The headscan is a vast improvement. The sculpt here is so tight& and the paint on the face and hair is razor sharp. The sculpting on the costume is beautiful and the solid paintwork helps the sculpt& instead of taking away from it. Articulation is plentiful.Dr Zauis attire here is based on his appearance in the second half of the first film.If you own the first version& I would still highly recommend this one. Plus& there are plenty of orangutans in the original Apes films& you could easily display them both as two different characters.His only accessory is his walking stick.Comes in nice cardboard packaging perfect for collectors - the figure can be removed from and returned to packaging with no damage."
11137,3510,5," NECA does it again& this is the Dr Zaius I remember from the original (and best) POTA movie (as opposed to the last Zaius figure with the costume from the end of the movie). Exquisite sculpt and an all round lovely collectable of an iconic 60s character. Some say that NECA do have problems with dodgy paint and articulation but the Zaius that I received was perfect so no complaints there. Display this alongside NECA's Zera and Cornelius& Ursus and his soldiers and transport yourself to The Planet Of The Apes. Long may this line continue."
11138,3510,5," The most accurate and well sculpted figure of Dr Zaius ever produced.I've always been a fan of the ape movies.The original is among my favorite movies of all time.neca have done a really nice job with this range"
11139,3510,4," NICE ONE."
11140,3511,5," Just what was asked for"
11141,3512,5," Bought for my son Christmas last.  The joints on the figure move very well.  My son loves it!!"
11142,3512,4," This is a highly detailed& well manufactured action figure.It is poseable and i would recommend it to all Dr Who fans as a small gift."
11143,3512,5," This toy is superior to its 12|counter part as it is a lot less likely to break at the shoulder joint and has much better detailed the paint work is designed to look like he has just escaped his exploding cyber plant where as the toys r us exclusive cyber throne set with cybercontroller and guards has a much more shiner cybercontroller o and this cyber control is not an Exclusive to Amazon because one you can get it at toys r us but they cost the same I shoud know I have to buy this stuf for my 18 year old in may son"
11144,3513,3," I bought this as it was produced by Nerf and thus was using compatible darts& allowing easy replacement. Overall& it seems to be pretty good. My only issues were that it doesn't have a mechanism to flip out the two dart guns (you have to flick your hand to flip them manually& basically) and& possibly because of that& had no way to keep them locked in place outside firing (so if you just held your arm down beside you& they'd flip out& possibly even dropping the darts). It does fire& but I'm not sure it's been thought through as well as most Nerf products."
11145,3513,5," Arrived on time and exactly as described very please would recommend to others."
11146,3513,5," Great customer servise. Highly recomended. Has to be 5 stars"
11147,3514,4," My eight year old grandson loves all things monsteresque. I know there is no such word& but this fits the bill. He has a collection& and when he comes to my house& he plays with this fantastic transformer. What a marvelous figure.My grandson came to visit today& and he absolutely loved this transformer. He had no problem putting this together in whatever mode he wanted& and he devised new modes. This is the kind of action figure that is wonderful for children. It fires the imagination& and since my grandson does not mind playing alone& he had a great time. He named this one Transformer Tony Grimobot. He played all afternoon and looks forward to his next visit.This is a sturdy action figure& and is available for all sorts of modes. I could not figure it out& but this eight year old did without any problems. If your child has a vivid imagination&than this transformer you is for them.Recommended. prisrob 05-26-14"
11148,3514,4," My son wanted one of these and he totally loves it. One issue was that as they are meant to be pulled apart my sone broke a leg piece off that was not meant to come off. Trusted superglue and damage was fixed for now...........so be warned."
11149,3514,4," Good product. was expensive compared to shops but i couldnt get him im shops. work the purchase my 7 years old loves hulk x"
11150,3514,1," My son loves his mashers but this item is not fit for purpose& it is designed so parts are interchangeable& but after a couple of months the ball joint at the hip has broken& this also happened to his spiderman too again after a couple of months& complete waste of money and a very unhappy child not a recommended combination."
11151,3514,3," The clicky on and off bits are a bit loose and fall off if you articulate them the wrong way. Our Hulk came with a detached leg that continues to fall off of its own accord. They are fine if you just want to take them apart and put them together again& but to actually play afterwards they are frustrating for the child."
11152,3514,1," head falls off constantly would not buy any of the other figures listed"
11153,3514,5," My grandson love this item as he also got a few others in the serise so loves that he can change them around.The item was of good quality for a toy& delivery are packaging was as expected.  I would use this seller again."
11154,3514,1," Only after 10 minutes a piece broke on this toy. Not good enough for a product that is designed to be |pulled about|Not good"
11155,3515,5," great i always wanted one but could never find one and finding this was great the phrases from the film and blaster sound are good anyone who loves star wars then this is a perfect collectors piece."
11156,3515,3," Brought this from JL for Â£20& an amazing figure with some great sounds from the movie. Purchased for a grandson but will be just as fitting on a desktop with the computer. Two buttons& one that fires the gun with flashing red light and sound& the other button on the chest that triggers the voice clips. Excellent figure that can be adjusted and repositioned. Any scratches can be removed with car polish as the figurine is made of hard plastic. Highly recommended and as we do interactive multimedia& music production and photography it will sit well on the desktop and workstations. Update& on trying to get another one& out of about 10 boxes only one was not damaged& the others included scratched body& head& legs. Ripped boxes& cello tape repairs and dust. Awful! Good toy but the box design means that someone will have been playing with it first& so not actually new!"
11157,3515,5," MUST BUY!!! GREAT SOUNDS AND REPRODUCTION& BOUGHT FOR YOUNG RELATIVE& WANT MY OWN !"
11158,3515,3," found the box was slightly damaged but the figure was excellent"
11159,3515,5," probably one of the most accurate looking stormtrooper sculps around today& only the artFX kits look better& only down side is the minimal articulation.Disney have done a great job with these figures& hope they release a sand trooper version."
11160,3515,5," Excellent storm trooper lots of phrases well detailed that's does not articulate very well but still I don't think it's a good toy but excellent item for collectors???"
11161,3515,4," Excellent figure very accurate for this kind of toy& only downside is the phrases it speaks are not in the right order& even so a great figure."
11162,3515,1," Great figure however i was posted a first order stormtrooper from the force awakens rather than an original trilogy stormtrooper."
11163,3516,5," he loved this figure set not alot you can say about it& just nice to add to a collection of monsters"
11164,3517,5," kids love it"
11165,3518,4," As my nickname is Sabe among the Star Wars fans& this is a must have figure for me. It seems to me that it's a good quality& paint is accurate& but it is not much poseable& which is a bit of downside& but I still like it."
11166,3519,5," Ordered for my little as a christmas present looks fab"
11167,3520,5," Great Kamen Rider Wizard Figure. Great Price. Love it!"
11168,3521,4," The figure is yet another great figure. Here's my opinion.Ood Sigma: This figure is fantastically detailed and looks a lot like Ood Sigma from Planet of the Ood and The End Of Time. The articulation is very good& but there's a bit I wish they had added. But& just to sum up& the Ood Sigma action figure is most certainly not a waste of money& and I highly recommend the figure to children and collectors. 7/10"
11169,3521,5," It is an amazing product and amazing priceI would recommend it to people with children that are in to doctor who also people that collect figures"
11170,3521,5," Bought this for son last Christmas.  The joints on the figure move very well.  My son loves it!!"
11171,3522,5," We bought this for our 10 year old son for Christmas& as one of his many Star Wars presents and he loved it. It was already assembled and was good value for money& it arrived on time and was well packaged."
11172,3523,5," Excellent buy. My Boyfriend is obsessed with all Star Wars Bobble Heads and this is the one I needed to complete the collection. Great quality product& thankyou."
11173,3523,5," I love my chewbacca wacky wobbler& looks boss on my desk ðŸ˜Š"
11174,3524,5," My grand daughter loves to sing and she certainly has done some singing with Elsa  a budding  Celione  if ever there was one &What a wonderful toy & I bought a spare one just in case it comes to a sad end . I could imagine the tears if it got  stood  so silly old me has another in reserve  Am I silly or are  there no bounds to the love of a Grand Child .My Grand parents would have done it for me  so it must be bred in !!!!!"
11175,3524,5," My little girl loves the microphone and sings let it go all the time."
11176,3524,1," Microphone doesn't work. Doesn't do what it's supposed to."
11177,3524,5," Perfect"
11178,3525,5," Love this series& they're a great price& lots of detail and very sturdy& keep my 4 year old and his friends entertained for ages! The magnet that holds the rider on is a nice feature too."
11179,3525,5," Really recommend these figures. Solid& weighty& great quality and paint finish. Figure& horse and sword can all be separated. Good value."
11180,3525,1," Not the same as in the picture& the horses' reigns just stick up in mid air. I should have bought an action figure instead."
11181,3525,5," Looks well made & bought as a present for my four year old grandson & who has a collection of Schleich knights and horses ."
11182,3525,5," Bought for four year old son for Christmas. He loves it and plays with it a lot with his knights and castle."
11183,3525,5," Great toy - my 4 year old son and his cousin had lots of fun over Christmas."
11184,3525,5," The item was delivery swiftly and it's a good product."
11185,3525,5," My nephew  loved this. Is great and very sturdy!"
11186,3526,5," Grandson loves this& price was ideal. Quick on delivery& good buying experience from this seller"
11187,3526,2," Head comes off too easily - very annoying!"
11188,3526,5," Excellent....my grandson loved it !"
11189,3526,5," Loved the dragon good price to!"
11190,3526,5," Good price my nephew loved it"
11191,3527,5," I bought this Gemini Smurf Schleich model for my friend's birthday (she collects Smurf collectables) and she loves it. It was good value for money and it came almost straight away. There was no damage on the product when it arrived and overall I'm very pleased with the product!"
11192,3527,2," The paint work on one of the Smurfs was disappointing as the eye was smudged. I was looking forward to receiving this but that ruined that excitement& never bothered to go through with the hassle of returning a small item."
11193,3527,5," Bought this for Christmas to add to my Grandson's collection.  He was thrilled with his 'twin' smurfs and I was pleased with the quality.  I'll certainly buy some more."
11194,3528,3," Definately not great for playing with& the Quad-arms struggle to hold the lightsabers at all.If however you plan on having this guy on a shelf& then you should be able to position him with ease& and he does look great! Jut prepare to have dissapointed kids if you intend to give this to them as a toy& because they WILL find it almost impossible for him to keep hold of all four Lightsabers."
11195,3528,5," Bought for Christmas/birthdays for the nephews who are collecting these sorts of things"
11196,3529,4," Thought it would be a little taller but still great figure."
11197,3529,5," Good!"
11198,3530,5," My grandson will love this"
11199,3531,5," very nice detail so works as an ornament when not lit up at nightnice mood light when it is&would have liked the option to use a poweradaptor as well as the batteries but that is a minor quibble"
11200,3531,5," I love this item& I was born in the year of Star Wars& just thought I'd mention that& its a Storm Trooper helmet! it lights up& its tactile& what more do I need to say?"
11201,3531,4,""
11202,3531,5," This mood light is well-designed and highly portable: it's extremely realistic& it feels good to hold& it's light -but durable- and it's 'wireless' as the light works exclusively with batteries.  It doesn't support a power adapter& but it's not a big deal for me.  The intensity of the glowing light in the dark is excellent.I invite you to watch my full 5-minute video review here on Amazon or in crisp 4K on YouTube: https:"
11203,3531,4," The best mood light any Star Wars fan could ask for. Didn't come with any batteries sadly but it looks really well both on and off."
11204,3531,5," Great night light"
11205,3531,1," smaller than expected but still pretty cool"
11206,3531,5," Bought for a 7th birthday present only to find that on opening the box the istructions warn that this is not suitable for under 14 yrs and not to be used as a child's nightlight!!! This was purchased after reading may review starting its use was by children and in many cases as a night light. Product description by the seller is VERY misleading."
11207,3532,4," The item is detailed and a hefty model making it stable when displayed HOWEVER it is a 7inch model so not to the same scale as most of the other Hasbro models this is my only criticism and thats my fault for not reading the description correctly"
11208,3533,4," I bought three of these little figures as stocking fillers for Christmas& at the moment they have not been given& but I was pleased with them"
11209,3533,5," exactly what i expected it to be - a fun stocking filler. The 2 grankidz loved them.will probably collect the set for them."
11210,3533,4," I didn't buy this as a toy but as a collectable due to being a fan of the smurfs from a very young age."
11211,3533,5," Received the item quickly&  all as pictured and described.  No problems&  check measurements - it is only small - which is what I required."
11212,3533,4," Great gift for children. Even adults can catch a nostalgic glimpse of their past. Not the best figurine& but still better than others."
11213,3534,3," Good pen :) son was very pleased. Just a shame the green pen bit is blue :/"
11214,3534,5," Purchased for a birthday. Absolutely love it! Awesome design"
11215,3534,4," Nice pen but not easy for little fingers"
11216,3534,4," Good pen & good gift"
11217,3535,3," Nice stickers and pictures to colour& however I thought I was ordering a book but it's just a packet of loose pages."
11218,3535,5," A lovely colouring pack. We have the Sophia one as well. Good quality pictures on good quality paper- sheets are loose."
11219,3535,5," 48 double sided good quality coloring sheets - and loads of stickers. Keeps them entertained for hours."
11220,3535,4," Bought for a gift therefore have not opened the sealed outer covering....I am sure the little girl will love this Colour and Sticker Book being her favourite Disney 'Frozen ' creations ! Thank You Amazon for swift delivery ."
11221,3535,5," Wish that that I could have had these books when I was a child& they are lovely."
11222,3535,5," this is going to make a good prezzie daughter going to love it would buy again"
11223,3536,5," More fun than you can possible imagine. Sturdy& cute& tactile& good quality& delicious smell...the list goes on.My 6 year old son loves it so much that he just carries it around empty!"
11224,3536,5," A purple rubbery pencil case.Great size&Great colour&Great price&One very happy daughter"
11225,3536,5," My daughter loves this pencil case and it smells great (as do the rest of the smencils range)- similar to but much more reasonably priced than the Smiggle products."
11226,3536,1," The key ring broke very quickly - expensive for what it is. :-("
11227,3537,5," This is a good entertainment stuff especially for those fans of Thomas and his friends. I bought it in July when we were going on holiday so my son won't get bored on the plane. Yes it did the trick& he was so happy when he saw it and screamed |Thomas| . And now he's got the colouring pencils left! :-)"
11228,3537,5," This set contains 8 colouring sheets& all with different pictures& 4 colouring pencils and a set of stickers.My nephew loves colouring them in& and I photocopy them so I always have at least one clean version for him.A cute little gift for someone who loves Thomas."
11229,3537,1," Arrived quick but a bit disappointed because I was expecting a colouring book. It turned out to be just a few pieces of paper with drawings of Thomas and Friends characters. Well that's what you will probably get for paying such a cheap amount."
11230,3537,5," bought this for a friends 3 year old. He was very happy with it. Good value for money."
11231,3538,5," Ordered for a birthday present for a 4 yr old. She loves it. Well worth the price"
11232,3539,4," not the best paint HOWEVER& if you want to pick up painting again or thinking of giving this new hobby a try& these are perfect because theyre good size for price and great quality."
11233,3539,5," Great acrylics - used them throughout my art A-Levels as a top up of all the colours I use the most. Great quality paint for the price :)"
11234,3540,5," felt pens - buy a better quality set rather than repeat buying of cheap and nasty ones and buy a box rather than smaller sets for even greater valuethis set is tried and tested and used regularly with a group of children on a twice weekly basis.- yes the colour does wash out if accidents happen- yes they can be revived if caps are left off or loosely fitted before putting away- yes they last ages and have a hard wearing tip so nib doesnt disappear with slight pressure- gives good results and cardboard partitions in the box make it easy to keep colours separate for group use - plenty to go round.- if you're wondering to buy fine or broad tips? - depends on the age group but these are more versatile and holding at a slight angle gives great broad line coverage for larger areas"
11235,3540,5," I do Rainbows and bought these for the girls as I needed a large number of pens. This is the cheapest that I could find them and it was a good price. The pens are separated into their own colours in the box& so don't arrive all muddled up which is great. Pens all perfect condition and just as described. I have found from past experience that the Crayola pens are long lasting and sturdy& so even with young children using them with too much force& the tips of them don't get all mushed up and broken."
11236,3540,5," No more fighting over markers and colours for my class - and no more frustration that they only last a week& as the cheap ones did.  4 months later (and very regular use) they are all still working - even the one we lost the cap for.  Highly recommend."
11237,3540,5," highly recommended! We suffer from all kinds of felt-tip problems: lost lids& dried out primary colours and untouched browns& but by getting them in bulk we can be sure to draw whatever we want& whenever we want."
11238,3540,5," Brilliant bright colours& and lot sof them.  Great for when friends visit& or for simply having more than one& so if you child uses up one pen& there are eleven more still!!!"
11239,3540,5," Brilliant colouring pens that seemed to have lasted forever. Great for children and adults alike. Colours lovely. Recommended for any art and craft box"
11240,3540,4," These pen's are really good to start with& but they dry out way to quick. I'm a childminder& and i'm finding that i'm throwing them away way to fast."
11241,3540,5," Quick delivery and the quality was as I expected. These pens are very popular in nursery and the children love trying all of the different colours"
11242,3541,5," Great item. Kids love using these. Would recommend and buy again from seller. No issues."
11243,3542,5," These smelly pencils went down a treat with my daughter. She has shared them around at school with her friends. She loves stationary and these were just that bit better as they have lovely smells."
11244,3542,5," Smell great.Great pencils but very overpriced.I wish I waited for Guernsey to get these in stock due to the almost half the price tag!"
11245,3542,5," Part of christmas present for niece who was very happy with them.  All in individual sleeves to keep their scent"
11246,3543,5," This is the best& most versatile crayoning set I've seen (and we've been through many in our home!).  It has a range of 40 Crayloa crayons with different nib sizes and a great choice of colours.  They're a cross between wax and pencil& you get a nice even colour and can crayon fast!  All a must for budding artists.  I'd made the decision to only buy Crayola from now on as cheaper makes just don't give the colour or coverage.  I'm ordering a set as spare and a set as a gift"
11247,3543,5," Fantastic colouring set. Comes in a great pack that you can keep all the pencils& crayons and pens in neatly. My 3yo loves them and no need for a sharpener& brilliant!"
11248,3543,5," the kids love these& fought over the one pack so much that i had to get another! Good quality pens& pencils& crayons all in the same place."
11249,3543,5," Really lovely drawing / colouring set which has provided hours of fun for my daughter so just had to buy another one"
11250,3543,5," This is a great colouring set with various pencils& pens and crayons.  Saves on a lot of pencil sharpening and the kids can just get on with their colouring without the pencils getting blunt."
11251,3543,5," Happy with the product.  I bought this for my 7yrs old but my 3yrs old also loves it.  Good quality and easy to use.  I ordered another 12 pack for her to take to school."
11252,3543,5," My children love these. They always liked drawing but thanks to these crayons they find easier to colour well and are even more enthusiastic"
11253,3543,5," Good value. Great colouring pencils and crayons that are much better than traditional crayons that snap in half after 2 minutes."
11254,3544,4," Great fun little set. Pad consists of colouring pages and plain paper. Little thin. Sissies actually cut! I was surprised& small so ideal for little hands. Stamping pad is small and the stampers are tiny& they work just small for hands. Overall my son loved it."
11255,3544,5," Excellent buyer& as described."
11256,3544,5," Brilliant!!"
11257,3545,2," Owl came with 1 eye missing and looked like it had been banged a few times as had marks on front and back. Shame as bought for a present"
11258,3545,5," bought as a gift for a friend who loved it !"
11259,3545,4," Bought for an owl loving friend who loved it"
11260,3545,5," a gift for Christmas i'm sure she'll love it"
11261,3546,5," very good"
11262,3547,5," Nice christmas present for a small boy& lots to do and most importantly packs away tidily& so mum was happy"
11263,3548,5," Very good quality and long lasting bold colours& they have quite a fat tip that goes to a point so ideal for very young as well as older children. Successfully washed of skin& dining room table& cloths and the living room wall."
11264,3548,5," Crayola Bright Supertips are good quality felt tips with an excellent range of colours including a 'flesh' colour much appreciated by the older children - and yes& they wash easily from hands and faces.  I can't say from personal experience that they wash from clothes& being a granny means I no longer have to cope with the laundry mountain& but have had no complaints.....well& not about felt tip on clothes!"
11265,3548,5," This buy has made everyone in the family happy people. The grandchildren can enjoy themselves& we don't have to worry about pen marks anywhere& and their clothes don't get ruined! Big people and little people are happy people"
11266,3548,5," Great pens for young children. Wash off hands with soap and water without lots of scrubbing. Come straight off clothes in wash."
11267,3548,5," These were ordered for children aged between 6 and 8& they were nice and easy to use they worked well on card and paper and were fine enough that they could use them for small colouring in pictures."
11268,3548,5," For all those times you found pen written all ouer ur furniture walls etc.Not anymore with these babies there excellent it just washes away with soapy water yay no more pen marks!!!!"
11269,3548,1," Unsure if they are defective or I just got a bad pack but bits broke off the tips so wasn't that happy with them for my little girl who could potentially eat them. Would buy elsewhere in future as the product itself when in good condition is great and they are washable from clothes but not some surfaces in your home (so keep an eye!)"
11270,3548,1," Don't bother wasting your money on buying these as they don't last. My 6 year old colours and drawers pictures every day and he was needing some new pens. I ordered these and they arrived in a couple of days. He had only had them for about a week when they started running out! I couldn't believe it. I've since bought some from our local supermarket and they are still working."
11271,3549,5," I liked the product. Was exactly what I wanted and hoped for. Can absulutely recomend it to others. Worth the price."
11272,3549,5," Absolutely fantastic!"
11273,3550,5," I can't comment on whether these are washable or not because luckily my 2 year old has only drawn on paper or his own skin so far!  These pens are the best quality felt tips I've bought.  The cheaper ones' nibs seem to disappear into the pen with him whacking them onto the paper& but these ones seem to be resistant to his force!"
11274,3550,5," I am a childminder and the children I look after just love art and drawing.  These felt tips are a little more expensive than |own| brands but are worth every penny.  They last much longer and their colours are vibrant.  Most importantly - they are washable too!"
11275,3550,5," good value and washable really does mean what it says& they water down to do pale colours and don't make as much mess as finger paints"
11276,3550,5," Fab for little messy toddlers that like to draw on everything and everything and fairly long lasting! Shall be buying again!"
11277,3550,5," As always great pens to use. I childmind so appreciate any felt tip pens that wash off easily! So these are ideal for me."
11278,3550,5," Excellent quality and nice and big. Being washable is a big attraction and thankfully if my little girl colour s all over her clothes& it does come out when washed. They are worth the extra money because they usually last longer than cheaper felt-tip pens. Great to buy them when they're on offer too."
11279,3550,4," I had been hunting for some washable felt tips for my 2 1/2 year old - many of the shops dont sell them. So these are a great find and they do as it says on the box 'they are washable'.  Which is essential with a toddler using felt tips!  Easy to hold pens& durable.  Very good would buy again."
11280,3550,5," I bought these felt pens as I HATE thin tipped pens> My son and daughter find it so difficult to colour pictures in with thin ones. These are fab and they do not run out quickly and come in great colours and a great price and wash out of clothes and do not mark tables! need i say more!"
11281,3551,5," very good value for money& I bought them online as I couldn't get them locally to go with my Granddaughters Dotty doodler."
11282,3551,5," Amazing value for money. These made my 5 y old very happy as she is very into drawing and colouring in at the moment. The makers are half-zised to the standard Crayola markers& but the sheer choice of colours makes it a perfect all-rounder. Washable too."
11283,3551,5," Very pleased with my Pipsqueaks Skinnies although it was a day late"
11284,3551,5," Great pens for little hands and they do wash out"
11285,3552,5," Great item shipped directly from japan!"
11286,3552,5," Uesfull for gundam."
11287,3552,5," Great product."
11288,3553,4," Great pen! would be ideal for decorating Christmas crafts.Coats pretty much anything in thick gold. Only let down may be the price and the strong smell of the ink/paint."
11289,3554,5," The pencils were a gift for Christmas and although the delivery could have been after Christmas. The pencils were delivered in plenty of time. The presentation was good and the packing excellent.I have used this product for more than 30 years and when my 7 year old grand daughter showed an artistic trait I considered these pencils would add another dimension to her drawings. Whilst I have had ne feed back from my grand daughter& I am evidently pleased with the product having experienced their usage all that time ago."
11290,3554,5," very well made pencils&quick delivery"
11291,3555,5," Kids felt pens"
11292,3556,5," Nice colours"
11293,3557,5," It looks so real that I am tempted to eat it every time I use it. I would definitely recommend to buy it."
11294,3557,5," I bought these rubbers to use at the school I work in& the children love them& they are great value for money."
11295,3557,3," This really is tiny. While it's a cute idea& I think it's pretty over-priced. However it arrived quickly with no issues"
11296,3557,5," Just like a real biscuit. So funny.Modes4u has loads of different rubbers& I'll buy a lot for my collection."
11297,3557,5," Gift for my sister&she thought it was great. Very detailed"
11298,3557,4," My daughter is collecting rubbers and is very pleased with the 8 erasers we bought.  Possibly better to buy a small amount at a time due to cost of p"
11299,3557,5," Beautiful& fun product& as other reviewers have said& much smaller than expected."
11300,3558,1," I bought these for my 2 years old son. Even it says that they are washable& they don't go from the hands even after the daily bath!!Horrible product and definitely not for small children!"
11301,3558,1," These pens are definitely not washable! They took ages to wash off my 2 year olds hands and have stained my wooden table and my childrens clothes! These pens went straight in the bin!"
11302,3558,4," These pens are nice& good size and colours& very comfy for my toddler to hold and draw& but I find it is a bit difficult to clean them off hands& clothes& table& etc. Clothes require a couple of machine washes to get rid of stains. We've had an alternative brand which were much more washable than these."
11303,3558,5," Nice chunky pens great colours...but did take a long time to wash off my grandson s fingers.Are they washable as in wash off clothes/hands easily because that's what I need?"
11304,3558,4," Bought for the Playgroup where I work.  Easy to use& long lasting& value for money.  Not quite as washable as the Crayola ones we had before."
11305,3558,5," Lovely pens& our two year old daughter has been using these for a while now and they are still going strong!"
11306,3558,5," great washes out of clothes but takes ages to come off hands ...."
11307,3559,5," Great fun& my son loves it and is learning so much.from it. Product arrived quickly and well packaged& will use again."
11308,3559,5," I was extremely pleased with the price of this storio e-book as I have paid much more in the past.  I bought my Granddaughters Vtech Storios last year and they love these products.  It is educational as well as amusing."
11309,3559,5," Nice addition for our library of Storio games.Bought it with sale so worth the price.Would definitely recommend the product and the seller."
11310,3559,5," great value for money at just a fra|ction of the high street price.great addition to my daughters xmas pressie..would highly recomend it"
11311,3559,5," very good"
11312,3560,5," Huge is what it is...I didn't see the dimensions and bought it as part of a 6 year old boy's birthday present. It's poster sized and the birthday boy looked thrilled to receive such a large gift. Considering it cost under Â£3.00 it's an absolute steal for anyone who loves The Trash Pack and colouring. Feedback from his mother was extremely positive."
11313,3560,3," My son loves anything Trash Pack related. I have to say& this wasn't great. The pens were rubbish and barely worked and the paper is wafer thin. But in fairness& my son noticed none of this and just loved it because it was Trash Pack."
11314,3560,5," The size of this pack is amazing. This was a well loved gift. Great item& but would advise that you have better pens at hand."
11315,3560,3," Ok"
11316,3561,4," I bought many packs of these pencils as part of a set of a number of presents for people at work. They are neatly presented in a cardboard box& (which is easy to fold and recycle/dispose of!) and contain the 4 rounded pencils.They are slightly smaller than I was expecting& however& they worked perfectly and made the presents complete! When using the pencils& they last an adequate amount of time for their purpose& and can easily see through a full days colouring.I would recommend these as stocking/party bag fillers for children over the age of 36 months. A well made and presented product."
11317,3561,4," did worry that wax pencils would arrive but they are defo pencils (and defo MINI ). When spotted i decided to combine them with colouring books for toddlers santa sack"
11318,3561,4," Good priceExcellent choice for party bagsKids love them& especially with different colours in each pack which gives them variety"
11319,3561,4," Brilliant! Good quality and the boxes are not too bad for kids (not tacky). Would definitely recommend for kids party bags."
11320,3561,4," Excellent price though not as pictured.. they actually come in a clear pack. Though I'm happy for price just why not show correct image"
11321,3561,5," Great to be put in party bags for my toddlers party. Really well priced and arrived promptly"
11322,3561,5," Brilliant for kids party bags and thank you for all your help brill seller"
11323,3561,5," great quantity - enough for my son's birthday bags! will buy again"
11324,3562,4," These pencils are relatively expensive but they are good quality.Sharpening does not result in broken leads& the colours offer good coverage on paper."
11325,3562,5," The pencils are of good quality.  A white one included would have been helpful though. We'll be buying more of these as needed."
11326,3562,5," Very nice product and well made...you can tell they've been made to last."
11327,3562,5," Very good quality pencils."
11328,3562,5," Good quality"
11329,3563,1," Great looking stampers. Unfortunately& within a week two of them had run out& followed by another 2 the following week. Needless to say& I've sent them back and had a refund"
11330,3563,5," My grandson"
11331,3563,5," My 4 year old loves these& so much fun to stamp! Great designs that kids will love and worth the money."
11332,3563,5," Enjoyed by my granddaughter who 2 yrs old& hands came clean after washing just as it says on the pack."
11333,3563,2," The stamps are not clear even when I tried to use them. A child has no chance."
11334,3564,5," Good little fillers for a party bag as a novelty. Good price for buying in bulk. I gave them to children to colour in a colouring competition on a bus trip. It kept them all quiet for a while!"
11335,3564,4," Received on time - product as displayed& although will have to sharpen them all as they are a little shoddy at the ends. Nothing that you wouldn't get in a store though. Great service."
11336,3564,5," Bought for brownies christmas pressents."
11337,3565,5," be sure to shake it up and test out on some spare material to make sure the metallic colour is coming out ok"
11338,3566,5," Bought this for grandson as he wasn't often allowed to share his big sister's ones. Now he has his own and can glitter and glue to his heart's desire. 16 great colours& handy size for little fingers. So he's still no great artist but he's having a lovely time making his imagination shine and sparkle."
11339,3566,2," Great selection of colours& but unfortunately too easy to squeeze for my toddler - the plastic for the pens is so soft that he only needs to give one good squeeze for the whole contents to end up in a pile on his paper.  Would have been better if he'd had to work a little harder to get the glue out ..."
11340,3566,3," These are really easy to use however with being so small they have nearly been used up already (Bought for xmas and now only just past new yr). Wouldnt say they were worth the money. Can buy just the same& cheaper else where. Think in this case you are paying for the name."
11341,3566,4," Great fun for big kids! Bought for a training session at work. Be careful when opening for first time dont squeeze to hard or you'll get a big blob."
11342,3566,4," Good size for small hands but rather difficult to get out of container.  Colours are bright and seem to keep colour over a time."
11343,3567,5," My 8 year old daughter got this and really loves it. There are so many activities you can do&  a nice gift"
11344,3567,2," Very small &and not good qualit for price"
11345,3567,5," Son loves it !"
11346,3568,4," Kids really like thses pens - really good value for money.  All pens worked and no broken tips on the pencils"
11347,3568,5," Crayola is always reliable and the good price made this a very good buy"
11348,3568,5," Good value for money."
11349,3569,5," No more hunting for pencil sharpeners.... cant be bad.  I bought these for my 6yr old daughter and she loves them. Ours have been dropped several times now and the lead has still not broken up inside (unlike normal pencils). Great."
11350,3569,5," Do great job. Very sturdy pencils and easy to write with them. No more sharpener. Bought them to school for my children .First time i bought them in the crayrola colouring pencils set. My son wrote with this pencil nearly one school year ( we got 2 in the set). I ve been looking for them very long time& wanted to buy them separately. Fortunately I found them on Amazon so i bought 2 sets. They come with eraser so it is very handy.I am gonna to check how they will work with pencil leads as replacement. I would definately recommend them."
11351,3569,5," I ordered these for my 12 year old daughter who is very impressed with them& she said they were too good to take into school!"
11352,3569,5," No sharpener needed - Crayola 3 Twistable Graphite Pencils are great.A simple twist is all you need when the lead wears down. It has an eraser top and the pencils are retractable too.The tips are not the finest so these aren't going to replace the traditional HB pencil but they do have strong leads and are great for on-the-go.My five year old likes using them and I use one as well.What will Crayola think of next.."
11353,3569,4," I bought this set of pencils for my 3 year old& and it turned out to be a waste.  After only a few minutes& the graphite was already out of the pencils and broken& it seems that it might be suitable for older children who know how to twist and use it.  In hindsight I shouldn't have bought it for him& however the quality of the pencil is quite good but the lead is quite thick."
11354,3569,5," these are great pencils no sharpening rubbers on top every thing you need ."
11355,3569,5," Originally purchased the coloured twistables for our 3 yr old grandson which were a big success.  He's now learning to write longer sentences so purchased the graphite pencils which are so much easier to use not only for grandson but also for grandad doing his crossword puzzles!!A very good purchase."
11356,3569,3," My son wanted these and they are great writers& his writing definitely looked neater with these pencils however 2 of them stopped twisting after 1 week&  a real pity as could have been so good !  Dont know if they were faulty or he was just too rough but they are for kids and should be more durable"
11357,3570,5," I bought this as a gift for my brother's 14th birthday. He's not a serious artist& but he does like to do a bit of artwork in his spare time& on rainy days and with the Summer holidays approaching& I thought this would be ideal. I was not disappointed. Although I live in a different city from my brother and have not seen the art set first hand& I am told that it is more than satisfactory for young& budding artists. My Step-Dad& who knows far more about art than I do& said that Reeves are a well known and reliable brand& and he was impressed with the set himself.Unfortunately& I am no expert in the field& but if you want to buy this as a gift for a young person who likes drawing and painting& then I cannot see you going wrong with this."
11358,3570,5," I bought this for a friend of my 8 year old who loves art and is now experimenting with different types of paints and papers. She loved it and has talked about it so much with my daughter that she now has one as well& and is having great fun exploring painting techniques."
11359,3570,5," Bought this on behalf of my mother when my youngest brother started secondary school and art homeworks started. The kit is excellent& all the art supplies you or your child could need or want& from paints to crayons! This set has proved to be a lifesaver to us as my brother is autistic and very fussy about doing his work to the letter& and with this kit that is never a problem! 1 issue tho is that the wooden case is a little cheap feeling so we transferred the supplies to an art drawer in a work desk."
11360,3570,4," My 9 year old daughter loves this....its hidden under her bed where the younger members of the family can't touch....its a grown up art set...I like its all together in one place."
11361,3570,5," Got this for my daughter's 8th birthday and she absolutely loves it. The items within the set are lovely quality and the box is sturdy. My daughter has used it almost every day since receiving it and is so pleased with it. Because it is a proper art set and not a kid's toy she is all the more happy and she has produced some lovely pictures as a result."
11362,3570,5," I chose this art box set for my 8 year old granddaughter and she loves it. It is very suitable for her age group ."
11363,3570,5," Its a great buy but the oil pastels are quite hard to use. I did not get an instruction manual which was a let down for me. The rest of the resources were great and"
11364,3570,5," Fantastic value& quality art set. Son is very pleased with the quality of the products within& hopefully this will assist him with his art homework."
11365,3571,5," My daughter spent hours playing with this& great for taking when we go out for dinner& kept her amused."
11366,3572,5," Great& i needed the variety of grey and these worked the charm"
11367,3573,4," G8 for price& quite creamy (prefer this)&and choice of colours.  First lot of oil pastels I have bought so can't compare with top brands.  Definitely happy with purchase."
11368,3574,5," I love the Alex Little Hands craft box range. This is the third box that I have purchased for my son and daughter and yet again it delivers. Both of my children& ages 4 and 5& are able to complete the crafts on their own which they love. Also& as well as improving and developing their fine motor skills the end result is something that they are proud of and which looks great. This cupcake box contains very cute fairies& flowers& butterflies& and crowns. Great for rainy days!"
11369,3575,5," This art set was a Christmas present for my daughter and it made her very happy. She is studying art at school and the set gave her an amazing amount of good quality stuff at a good price."
11370,3575,5," Just bought this for my son for his homework and such like& when it came i had second thoughts of giving it him for one of his christmas presents and just keep it myself.well worth the money for the well made box the stationary comes in its bigger than i thought it would be."
11371,3575,5," The packaging is of a very high quality& the sort of box you would expect on an adult product. The kit has high content and definitely suits creative and art focussed children."
11372,3575,5," My daughter does art and she wanted a colouring set for her work.  I saw this and thought of my daughter& when she got it she was so happy and as long as she is happy I am happy.  She uses it for her Art work at school and so far its doing a good job."
11373,3575,4," good for price& gave them as xmas presents and kids liked them. seen more use than the tech toys they got!"
11374,3575,2," This arrived today and when I opened it all the top layer of crayons had come loose during transportation.  Not a problem as such& but whilst putting them back I noticed some colours repeated.  This led me to investigate the bottom layer and although there ARE 60 colouring pencils in total there were less than 30 colours!  All four of the oranges were the exact same shade with the rest having 2 shades of each colour.I admit I feel a bit cheated.  This gift is for my daughter's birthday next month and I'm contemplating sending it back for the above reasons.Probably a great 'shared' gift where both kids want the 'dark blue'& but certainly not what I was expecting."
11375,3575,3," I bought this for my niece who was over the moon with it. When I received it I opened it up as I had read previous reviews& some good& some not so good. I was glad I did& the pencils are not held in so it looked a complete mess. I rearranged them and Sellotaped a piece of card over each layer. This held them in place for when my niece opened it herself. She will always have to keep the card on the pencils or they will always be all over the place ach time she opens the box. I think this could have been easily overcome when the pencil holders were made and at probably no extra cost. Otherwise it looks to be good value for money."
11376,3575,5," Good case& and a great variety of pencils.  Lots of different colouts.  Bought for a 7 year old& however would be suitable& for older child."
11377,3576,4," Great buy& my nephew who loves drawing like it very much."
11378,3577,5," Just what I was looking for& great for a little Despicable Me fan& it should keep him occupied and happy when stuck indoors."
11379,3578,4," Bought as a present for Xmas& so haven't used these yet& but by the looks of them& my daughter will be very happy& the outer design is great and having used blopens previously& I'm sure she'll be very excited to use these."
11380,3579,3," Good quality stencils& delivered on time and as described but there is no lid on the box so everything falls out once you've opened the protective plastic wrapping. Think the price is a bit high."
11381,3579,5," This was a Christmas gift for my 5 year old dinosaur mad nephew.  Suffice to say he (and his parents) thought it was 'BRILLIANT' on Christmas day.  With the rubbing plates this is so much more than just stencils& and I must say this was larger than I imagined when ordering.  Well worth the money."
11382,3579,4," My grandson had a big operation on his back was on his back for 6weeks allowed to sit 35degrees for a while each day these kept him from getting majorly bored"
11383,3579,4," A bit fiddly to start with&  but once we used it with a standard clipboard it worked a treat.  Happy to recommend to anyone who loves dinosaurs."
11384,3580,5," Love it"
11385,3581,5," These pens are absolutely brilliant. They are great for writing& and it encourages my 4 year old to write. I actually love them myself! The colours are strong and& well& sparkly without being messy. My daughter does colour with them& but I think they are better suited to writing. The yellow is perhaps a bit wishy washy for writing."
11386,3581,4," I bought these to use for writing my Christmas cards- the colours are vibrant and bright. Easy to write with and clear to read& apart from the yellow which is not great for writing with.These are perfect for adding a bit of interest to greeting cards and envelopes."
11387,3581,5," Loved by my 5 year old& if you have a little one that loves |glitter& sparkles! these are the pens to buy.."
11388,3581,5," These pens are great! We first bought a pack of these ages ago& (over 2 years)& and they have lasted and lasted. Finally& a couple of them seemed like they were going to give up the ghost& (after a huge amount of use)& and so I have just invested in a new pack. I hope that these last as long!Whilst you might think that glitter pens would be a bit...well...girlie& these pens really aren't. The only |girlie| colour in there is pink& and my two little boys enjoy using that to write cards to their girl friends& or grandma etc. The other colours are gold& green& blue& orange& and purple and they are all wonderful& vivid colours. The sparkle& whilst clearly there& is fairly subtle. The pens produce a lovely& relatively fine line& so they're not great for colouring in but for producing writing that you want to stand out they really excel! We absolutely love using these to write cards as they really do make the writing look so special. A minor issue that we've come across is that you get a lot of colour out of these pens and the writing can be wet for a little while - not so much a problem for most perhaps& but my little left-hander often struggles not to smudge his writing when using these. Of course& that would be the same with a lot of other pens too& and he loves these ones so much that he persists with them.When the ink in our new pack of pens runs out& we will be buying more. For us they have been amazing value for money...so much so that perhaps I should buy my own pack& instead of constantly stealing the kids pens!! :) Highly recommended."
11389,3581,3," Nice colours& didn't go blotchy as some gel pens do.  7yr old who loves writing has used them a lot since Christmas and has discovered they don't last long if you use them for colouring!"
11390,3581,4," Lovely pens for youngsters. Nice size for little fingers and pretty effects from the glittery colours. Washable ink& so easy to clean up any mess or drawing on the walls!"
11391,3581,5," This item arrived promptly. I love using them for colouring in one of the many lovely colouring books for adults that you can get now. This is a rewarding and very relaxing hobby. The glitter pens look really pretty and add a lovely dimension to whatever designs you are colouring or drawing."
11392,3581,3," I bought these for my daughter to use at school and she has complained that they blot and smudge a lot. She claimed to have used a friends one which is a different brand and which works far better...asked her to check which brand it is next time round. Will not be purchasing Crayola again."
11393,3582,5," Our little scientists (8y and 6y boys) love the marker maker& which they call their laboratory kit. The refill pack offers hours of extra fun and great opportunity to widen the colour experiments. The coloured bottles also offer extra fun after the marker tubes are all used. we have then used the colours in other art work as well as some chemistry experiments... two thumbs up!"
11394,3582,5," As another reviewer has said"
11395,3582,5," My daughter and i love this. It's so much fun and fascinating to watch too! This is the best price I have found to date all-in and the refills arrived very quickly! Winner all round"
11396,3582,5," A great way of making the Marker Maker Kit last even longer.  Good value for money and gives an extra lease of life to marker that have already been made and used up.  Think Green!"
11397,3582,4," Good fun& this is the second refill kit my son has had& but we can never use all the dyes before we need some more pens& nibs and felts etc. Also& it would be good to get a different set of colours to base the mixes on please. My son and his friends really love it though and it is great quality."
11398,3582,5," Bought as refill pack to Marker maker for Grandchilds birthday& well worth the money for maker"
11399,3582,5," Nicely priced and do what it should."
11400,3582,3," Had to buy a refil pack as the dye runs out quickly if you are inventive with your colours. Larger bottles should be supplied in both the marker maker box and the refill pack."
11401,3583,5," I adore Adventure Time and I purchased this item to go with my AT notebook. I thought this would be a quirky little stationary set and to be honest I wasn't expecting an amazing product due to the low price. I was pleasantly surprised however. The pencils are of great quality. I was expecting them to be cheap pencils with a patterned wrap which was of poor quality and fall off. However this pencil is not at all cheap and scratchy like I was expecting. It is a great quality pencil and I haven't had any issues with it. The lead is strong and does not break. The AT pattern round the outside is great too. It is of high quality and has not worn at all. I haven't used the rubber yet but I look forward to using it. It feels like a rubber should and not one of those plastic coated ones that smudge rather than erase. I have used the sharpener and it does the job. I love the fact that it has a little cover that can hold the sharpening waste until I go and empty it. A very nice little stationary set for a big child like myself"
11402,3583,5," Really nice item that was bought as a gift. Really lovely set& not sure on the quality of the items as they have been used& but exactly the sort of the thing expected of this sort of item"
11403,3583,3," Pencil sharpener lasted about a week before breaking...overall the product quality was a reflection of the price rather than being the bargain I'd hoped for."
11404,3583,5," Bought as a birthday present and they loved it! Great value and lovely items& good dispatch and delivery times from seller& thank you!"
11405,3583,4," Bought this for secret santa at work as a joke"
11406,3583,5," I recived excellent customer service and the set is just like the photo. Very happy. Thank you :)"
11407,3583,5," Bought this for my 6yr old son as a stocking filler.  Excellent value arrived quickly"
11408,3583,5," Came really quickly and are good quality products - so cheap for what you get!!"
11409,3584,5," Lovely item& and quick delivery& very pleased."
11410,3584,5," Love this product. excellent for the price"
11411,3584,4," There ok for the price"
11412,3585,5," Nephew was thrilled and delivery was swift!"
11413,3586,3," Bought as a gift for Christmas - but as yet& not managed to see the recipients who these crayons were meant for."
11414,3586,4," Kept me colouring for hours"
11415,3586,5," Excellent quality"
11416,3586,5," Excellent"
11417,3586,4," Good"
11418,3587,5," Lovely little item& my girls will love these. Great value for money. Fast service too"
11419,3587,5," Decent enough product for price paid& bought as part of gift for kids party."
11420,3588,5," Item came well very packaged (had a recent bad packaging experience elsewhere on Amazon) and was dispatched promptly within the seasonal rush. It's actually bigger than it looks in the picture and in a sturdy box. Given as a gift to someone who asked for this set& so can't comment on quality of what's inside."
11421,3588,4," This art set includes an art pad (of plain paper)& three stencil sheets (pirates& Egyptian patterns& castles/swords)& ten postcards& four metallic paints& six paint pens& five markers& a watercolour tray and paintbrush& sixty wriggly eyes and sixty stickers. On the plus side this is a nicely packaged set& which would appeal probably more to boys and it is hard to get art sets for older boys (this is suggested for ages 6+). So& if you do have an arty boy â€“ or indeed girl â€“ with an interest in the Horrible Histories books& then this would be a lovely present. However& although it does have a lot of positives& there are a couple of negatives. Firstly& the pieces do not pack back inside easily& unless your child are careful and keep all the plastic inlays (mine are not that careful!). That is a minor gripe& but I always do prefer toys where you can pack away the pieces so they donâ€™t get lost. Also& I thought it was a shame that were not any colouring sheets. It would have been nice if there had been some posters to colour or if the art pad had had activity/colouring sheets& rather than just plain paper. Overall& though& this is an interesting set with lots to do and will appeal to all lovers of the Horrible Histories â€“ with particular appeal to boys."
11422,3588,5," I got this expecting a small box with a few bits in it. I was suprised to recieve a very large box with a fair few bits in it. Paints& felt tips& paint pens& sticker sheets... and the list goes on. All in all a great set for the price."
11423,3588,4," Very handsome art set. The actual components& paintbox etc are unremarkable but the tie in to the popular Horrible Histories books/TV series will& I'm sure make this a hit with younger artists."
11424,3588,4," This set contains a good collection of art materials themed around the very popular horrible histories books and tv programmes. There is an Art pad& paint pens& stickers& stencils& metallic paints& marker pens& paintbrush& watercolour tray and wiggly eyes. No complaints from my 8 year old horrible histories fan about the contents of the box. However& I think this set could have been improved if a bit more information/project ideas linked to history had been included to tie the materials together with their theme a bit more strongly."
11425,3588,5," I really only wanted to leave feedback about the packaging and postage of this item.  This toy is fantastic and it is great value& however it cost me much more due to the completely oversized box it arrived in!  We had to take time off work to drive to the other side of the city to collect it& as this toy was packaged in a box which was approx. 10 times larger than the actual toy box!  Therefore& it was oversized and far too big to fit at the local parcel motel!While I can recommend the toy itself and the great value& I would ask that the sender relook at how they package them up for shipping!!"
11426,3588,5," Well done the Horrible Histories team for producing this - just the job for a dreary day in halfterm and it entertained 3 grandsons admirably.  They are HH fans so pounced on it with glee and their Mum was equally enthusiastic when she realised that the paint is washable. A nicely packaged sensible art set."
11427,3588,4," It doesn't have to be history-linked& that's just pretty much the branding and packaging on the box. Certainly this kind of thing goes down well in our household where we are just getting into the Horrible Histories& but any kid who likes art should be able to create something with this& historical or not."
11428,3589,5," Lovely set of pens which we've bought before and love (they're actually washable!) in a sturdy carry case with paper. Great for in the car or taking on trips. Very happy daughter!"
11429,3589,5," My son loves these and the case is great for making sure he keeps them all tidy and all with lids on. His friends also like playing with these"
11430,3589,5," Bought as Christmas present so although not used I am happy with the quality and price and can't wait to give it to my child"
11431,3589,5," Excellent and enjoyed using them.  Case is good and they return them to the proper place."
11432,3589,4," Not used yet but will make a lovely present."
11433,3589,5," Very useful when out in the car or visiting"
11434,3590,4," I think it's good& but it's a bit small if your wondering about size. chocolate donut eraser from Japan by Iwako"
11435,3591,5," the little man I got this for absolutely loved it! his mum was ok with it too as it was to be used in a confined area and washed off well."
11436,3591,5," well worth the money..."
11437,3591,5," loved it"
11438,3592,5," This has been so useful in my art work. there is a wide variety of hair colours and skin tones. Recommend"
11439,3592,5," Product as described& arrived before expected delivery date. Very pleased& would recommend."
11440,3592,4," My granddaughter loves them for her art work"
11441,3592,5," My daughter loves them...very good colours"
11442,3593,5," Bought this for my 7yr old daughter and for one of her friend's as a birthday present.  Both absolutely loved them and have spent hours making lovely pictures for everyone. Easy to use and highly recommended.  We actually saw these demonstrated at Hamleys (but preferred to buy them from Amazon!)"
11443,3593,5," These pens are excellent! They work really well and make some fantastic effects. Can make you a bit light headed with a lot of use lol. Got these as a gift for my daughters birthday and thought I have to get some for my daughter as well! Defo recommend"
11444,3593,5," We as in A 6year old and myself Just a Smidge over 21 I got these as a Gift I Checked the insides before Wrapping"
11445,3593,2," The stencils are made of very flimsy card which is a shame. They certainly won't last long& you would have thought for the price they would have been plastic that can be washed and reused numerous times! Not only that& you have to pick out all the perforated bits of card before you can use them! For this it should be Â£10 at the very most. Disappointing and frustrating for my young children!"
11446,3593,4," Great but a big box for 8 pens. If you offered cheaper refills would easily rate 5 stars. 7 year old loves them and plenty of scope for older kids& lovely colours and air-brush affects. Obviously you need care where you use them but washable/ easily wipe off surfaces like the laminate floor."
11447,3593,3," Have had the frozen blo pens in the past and they had a plastic type coating over the stencils-the fantasy as great pictures but plain flimsy cardboard-not sure how long they are going to last so disappointed"
11448,3593,5," My daughter loves blow pens& although they don't seem to last very long& and if she doesn't put the lids back on they dry up pretty quickly. I was quite surprised how accurate she can be with them."
11449,3593,2," Bought this set& along with the animals set&  for my daughters 7th birthday after she had seen them advertised on the TV and although they have been a hit with her I was left feeling a little unimpressed with the contents of the box.Firstly there was an expectation of the stencils being at least the size of the box (just proud of A4).  This was not the case they were more A5 in size.Secondly the quality of the stencils were found to be a little wanting as they are made from rather flimsy card and I would question the life span of the stencils being made from such a cheap material (the box actually states that the stencils are 'reusable' although I'd question their longevity).Thirdly& and most annoyingly& the stencils are not ready to use out the box.  Essentially they arrive with the pattern/picture perforated into the card and you then have to pop each of the pieces out.  This posed three problems... 1) due to the flimsy cheap card used each stencil is easily damage if due care and attention is not paid... 2) my 7 year quickly lost interest as she wasn't really able to perform the intricate task of removing some of the pieces of card and... 3) it took myself& and the wife& a considerable amount of time to remove pieces of card from each stencil (okay a rather small point but rightly or wrongly I assumed that they would be ready to use).Despite my 3 groans above the stencil sets were well received by my daughter however I will not be purchasing any further products from John Adams without prior investigation."
11450,3594,5," really good hello kitty stuff as my daughter is crazy about it& its alot smaller than what i thought and was expecting it to be alot big for how much i paid for it& but kids love it and not that bothered by the size"
11451,3594,4," My 8 year old daughter enjoys using this. She makes beautiful patterns and spends ages colouring them in. Was a bit disappointed there was only one wheel& but she can still make lots of designs. Good value for money though."
11452,3594,5," Bought for my neice who loves just Hello Kitty combines a child's live of drawing with a girls love of pink and Hello Kitty. Great little present for a little girl 5-10 Is say"
11453,3594,5," Brought this for my 8yr old and she loves it"
11454,3594,5," Brilliant"
11455,3595,5," got gthis for my son when we went abroad to use on the plane&  Couldnt believe how many colouring sheets came with it.  My son coloured for nearly 2hrs on the plane& took it out for meals every night& coloured in the apartment and on the flight home and still ahd a couple left!  The colouring pens excellant quality too. Highly recommend"
11456,3595,5," Great little product. I bought this set for my daughter and its been such a hit that I bought another one for one of her school friends. Great individual pages to colour at home or out and about to keep little ones occupied. Arrived in super quick time. Thank you."
11457,3595,4," Great little travel present bought for my son although the carry box didn't last very long but then what do you expect from a paper box?"
11458,3595,4," Handy for car journey pens are good quality and a bonus that they are washable. Passes the time on journeys."
11459,3596,5," I have got 3 children so I did think these would get some use from them. However& I actually bought them to add some sparkle to my home made computer greetings cards at Christmas.I wasn't expecting them to work as well as the traditional glue on paper& sprinkle glitter& shake off method but they actually worked much better.The easy to hold pen design allows for greater definition and control for the placement of lovely sparkly glitter. They come in some really beautiful colours and once dry (takes about 2 hours or so to be totally dry) can create some stunning effects. The glue starts off raised up on the paper after application but you should find it settles down to near flat so that all that is visible is the glitter.Great product for both adults interested in home crafts and children for play and fun."
11460,3596,2," Very disappointed as this is a crayola product and was expecting their usual good quality. The pens are more like glue pens rather than glitter glue pens. Apart from 1 or 2 pens the rest didnt not work properly because all the glitter had dried on one side of the tube and only the glue was pumping out. So in the end I cut the tubes and mixed the glitter glue to use it.I would not buy this product again as I saw some cheaper quality ones in sainsbury's today and they seemed to do the job well."
11461,3596,3," These glitter glue pens are so much fun to use on cards and pictures. My only problem is that 4 out of the 9 pens only have a centimeter of coloured glitter and the rest is glue. The glitter sits at the bottom and won't mix in with the glue. The other 5 are brilliant to use."
11462,3596,1," Was expecting easy to use pens for xmas labels& it takes alot of strength and the gel does not come out steady& so your left with blobs on your letters& very disappointing more in view of being crayola."
11463,3596,5," Lovely glitter glue pens which have come in useful for many craft activities. They apply smoothly and easily through the small tip on them& meaning that it is quite easy to be precise when applying it.I was very happy with how quickly and well they dried& and the range of colours that came in the packet!They have lasted well considering how often they have been used& and have been well worth the money."
11464,3596,2," Difficult to open pens..no instructions....top had to be unscrewed with pliers& then a green stopper had to be removed.  Children would need adut help unless they were budding engineers.No point in complaining to Crayola..."
11465,3596,5," Excellent value and great selection of jewel like colours.  Easy to apply in thin or thick layers& dries fairly quickly according to depth.  Not quite 30 minutes& so recommend leaving to thoroughly dry for 1 to 2 hours. Very pleased with this item."
11466,3596,5," Thought it maybe slightly more pricy than the other types available on amazon& it is definitely better !!I got two packs of glitterglues from amazon. The cheaper one was half emptied prior to start using it. This one is much better !!"
11467,3597,1," I can only assume the ones I received were faulty because from reading the description and reviews I expected mess free and fast drying liquid chalk suitable for my preschooler to use on his black and white boards. Instead the liquid pours out of the tips when he draws& dripping down the boards and staining everything it comes into contact with when wet. It doesn't even give good coverage - when it comes into contact with a shiny surface it just separates like any normal paint would. After waiting ten minutes for it to dry on the whiteboard I eventually gave up and wiped it off still wet& only to find it had stained the board. I also got some of the blue on my fingers when I was cleaning it off and have walked around looking like a smurf for two days. Tried them on paper and they dried quickly& but he can use crayons for that. Really can't understand the good reviews for these unless I've got a faulty batch. They're going straight back!"
11468,3597,5," I loved the whole texture of the chubi chalk as we used them in nusresy i got them for my daurter and she loves them and now she wants to do more creative things the best thing i got for my 2 and a half girl. Fab fab"
11469,3597,5," My granddaughter uses these at her Nursery and they are brilliant.  We've now bought them for home& they are not messy and they provide hours of fun."
11470,3598,5," This is like the aquadraw mats except it is all conveniently bound by a ring binder.  The water filled brush works very well and is a good shape for tiny hands.  I like that the colours fade ready to be painted again& very eco friendly.  No mess& no fuss colouring in.  I'd recommend this to any parent of a toddler."
11471,3598,5," I purchased this book for a little boy of 5& who& because of a physical disability& has limited use in his arms and hands.  I have been waiting to hear from his mother to learn how he got on with it before writing this review.  She told me the book was a good size for her son (A5)and the pages& being thicker than normal& are reasonably easy to turn. The dabber supplied with it was a good size for him to hold and does not run out of water too quickly& therefore he was kept amused for ages.  He loved watching the different farm animals appear and the picture revealed was bright and cheerful.  After about 10mins the picture disappears as it dries and is quickly ready to use again. She considers these books to be a good idea for children that have limited movement in their hands and/or arms as they feel a sense of achievement knowing they have made the picture appear themselves.  There is no mention in the description of this book that it is reuseable and I think that should be added as it is a big bonus. As for me& I have more young children to buy presents for and I will certainly have this particular one on my shopping list again& and will be looking for more of the same!"
11472,3598,5," bought one each randomly for twin 3 and a half year olds. brilliant. they love them. no mess. dry and repeat. twin 1 asked if his masterpiece could be put up on the wall so his face dropped a bit when he looked again and the picture had 'disappeared'! i explained it was a magic picture and he could play tricks on other members of the family. his face lit up and he began 'colouring' again then 'doing magic tricks' with the pics to family members - they haven't left them alone. cheap and easy. recommended."
11473,3598,3," Good to keep them busy for a short amount of time& keep one in my bag if we go to a restaurant or in the car& too much water does damage the pages slightly and we use an aqua doodle pen rather than the one supplied because it leaked a bit"
11474,3598,5," Every parent should have one of these!  There will always be times when you want your child to sit quietly - visiting the grandparents& going to a restaurant or just letting their dinner go down and these are just the ticket.  A practical alternative to messy activities like painting and drawing& they just use water.  The pad is A5 size so easily fits into a changing bag and can be whipped out when boredom sets in.There are 8 different pages and when they are drawn over using the water pen (included) the colours come to life to reveal lovely farm pictures.  I had some of these books as a child which I remember being a bit green/grey but these are for the new generation - the colours are vibrant and they quickly dry out and can be reused.The farm scenes are appealing for all children and suitable for both boys and girls.  There are some lovely |hidden| details too.These are designed to be used by children 3 years + but I have bought it for my 18 month old and she loves it.  She initially used a paintbrush dipped in water but now uses the water pen provided.  I remove the cap of the water pen which is the only obvious hazard.  Really cannot recommend highly enough."
11475,3598,5," We were given one as a present and i've since bought several as gifts for others. We already had a Aquadraw mat and like the concept of using a pen which fills with water to draw / doodle / play& as there is no mess& its reusable and handy to take to friends houses& restaurants and in the car.This is more of a colouring idea than the Aquadraw mat but still great for our 2 year old daughter to doodle& chat about the pictures she is uncovering and generally distract her for chunks of time. They are relatively cheap& durable and a good size to take out and i'd definitely recomment them. The only thing i'm not so keen on is the size of the lid of the pen (as we have a younger baby) and comparing the pen to the Aquadraw mat pens i'm not sure why these ones have lids which could potentially be swallowed while Aquadraw mat pens don't have lids at all. But isn't a big issue - just means we are careful about not leaving it lying around."
11476,3598,4," Love this concept and would buy this product again& but there are a couple of minor downsides to aware of to prevent frustration. Mainly& my little figured out that she could scratch the surface of the pages and removed the |film| that makes the picture appear& so on the first day ours was marred by fingernail scratches on a couple of pages. The other less problematic bit is that the backing of the pages is a compact cardboard-like material. That means that when the pages get wet from the water the page goes a bit soggy temporarily. We have however used this over and over again and it dries out with no problem! The pen with water has worked well& though occasionally dispenses a bit too much water. All in all& this is a great product with a couple minor flaws. I would recommend this product and the seller as it's been quite useful and was delivered early! :)"
11477,3599,5," Have had the office in stitches with this. Had one of these when I was about 13& they are a lot of fun. ðŸ˜¸ðŸ˜¸ðŸ˜¸"
11478,3599,5," Childish and immature. (Apparently) I ordered two!"
11479,3599,5," Good joke product which produces loud bang."
11480,3599,4," It's good fun& could look more realistic."
11481,3600,5," Another fun eraser I took for my daughter's Iwako collection :) Very happy with it. Highly recommend it. Very reasonable price too."
11482,3600,4," My daughter can not get enough of these& and they are the latest craze at her school. She loved it"
11483,3600,2," This product was as shown in the picture but I hadn't appreciated how very small it was. It was tiny. Would be a bit fiddly for a child to hold."
11484,3600,5," Great quality& they're really cute and great for a gift and rub out well aswell. I love them! Awesome colours!"
11485,3601,5," i wanted to get my toddler something that could be of use to him as is recep and starting t get colouring homework.when i got this product i found it in pristine conditition with no dents scratches. the delivery was surprisingly quick and my kid loves it. it'll take him a while to wear away all of the colouring equipment there is in there"
11486,3601,5," I was looking for a gift for my son's friend from school who is a Peppa pig fan& I didn't want to pay too much as he had already been invited to four other party's! This is a good set with a lot in it& a mix of paints& pencils& felt tips& oil pastels plus ruler etc. Looks a lot more expensive than it was. It folds up into a plastic case with a popper fastening so you can take it anywhere. I bought it along with some Peppa pig posters& it was a real hit and the mum came up to me in the play ground and said how much she love it!"
11487,3601,5," Got for a friend for christmas& she loves it& had to order another elsewhere as this wasn't available as she had used to use it everyday"
11488,3601,5," Bought for a gift for a 4 year old girl. Well received."
11489,3602,5," I have got 3 children so I did think these would get some use from them.

11497,3603,5," Great pens. Lovely bright and intense colours. Have a ridge on the lid so they are classed as non roll. Never found this a problem before but as it's Melissa and Doug they do aim to be different!  This feature aside they are great pens and I will look out for a bargain price on them again."
11498,3603,5," Lovely pens - good quality& as to be expected from Melissa"
11499,3603,5," really good"
11500,3604,4," my granddaughter will love it."
11501,3605,5," We were at a friend's house with a 2 year old and three 5 year olds and she had this set up in the middle of the playroom. What a genius idea!  The girls loved it& enjoyed colouring and came back to it the whole afternoon.  Great that the colouring pens are included& and they slot into the chimney.  And out 2 year old managed to get lots of colour on her top& which washed out no problem.  They played inside the house and it is still up now 3 weeks later& but perhaps the best thing is that when it stops being useful& it goes in the recycle bin!"
11502,3605,5," Very useful for our christmas production& and could be used again for something else with the brownies."
11503,3606,5," Good quality"
11504,3606,5," good"
11505,3607,5," Who ever thought that it would make any kind of difference what markers you buy?! Well& wait till your 3 year old becomes obsessed with colouring. Turns out& there are quite a few features you can want in a marker (other than: it works!) and these seem to have them all.Demand no.1& 2 and 3 (for me at least) washability!!! Turns out& many manufacturers are liars& but these wash out of anything so far. Clothes& faces& hands& hardwood floors& table cloths and furniture fabric.The colours are vibrant and with 14 in a pack& lot's to choose from. They colour at any angle (unlike the Crayola Beginnings& which seems to work less at an angle). They fit tiny hands well but because the caps are large and fit tightly on the other end& you can transform them into grown up size markers if your kid wants you to help out (also like& stated in an other review& the size makes them less of a chocking hazard). The last very long (had them since xmas and my girl colours A LOT) and so far& seem to be crush-proof.Lastly& because they are small& they are ideal to pop in little compartments of (hand)bag& car door& stroller& etc. with a few sheets of paper as instant entertainment on the go.(oh yeah& and my girl loves to stick them together tip to end and make long towers :-) )Brilliant value for money& will be buying them again and again (though so far& the first pack is still working fine& knock wood)"
11506,3607,5," I'd add to the above review& which is spot on& that these pens have the added bonus of very large lids - If you have one of those 'keep you on the edge of your seat' kids who insist on trying to choke themselves on(or put in their eyes& ears and up their nose) anything to hand these are brilliant as they simply can't fit them in!!! They've lasted awhile too."
11507,3607,4," These pens are great for little fingers. My daughter is 19 months and holds the pens really nicely because they are not too big. They have the benefit of being washable which is in my opinion a must. I would really like to see some pens that are triangle in shape as the only downfall as with most pens is that they roll off the table."
11508,3607,5," These were bought for my 3 year old and have proved to be a bit hit - the colours are lovely and bright& the pens easy to hold and they have lasted well.  From my point of view& I like the fact that the lids click on securely and fit on the end of the pen when in use - this has prevented the lids being lost& as has happened with countless other pens.My 16 month old has also started using these - they are chunky enough for her to hold and have no small bits she can swallow.  The thick nibs have also stood up really well to a more heavy-handed approach!The only downside (for those of us with kids that colour everything except the paper!) is that the ink is a bit of a pain to get off of skin.  It does come off& but not before I have a very grumpy toddler!  However& it washes out of clothes fine& in my experience.Overall& highly recommended for all budding artists!"
11509,3607,5," Love these mini markers.  Just the right size to carry around permanently in a handbag with a small notepad& and hey presto! Instantly quiet children when out and about in the cafe& in church& at the doctors... Lovely bright colours that seem to last for ages."
11510,3607,5," In a nutshell these 'Pipsqueaks' are fab little pens. Lots of colours in a set that have good felt nibs to them.For my daughters I keep them in the car for car trips as I find they are ideal to use and don't take up a lot of space.Not only are they washable (I found marks on the carpet and they came out quite easily) which is good news for Mums& or any parent/carer but they are colourful"
11511,3607,5," We have these and the Crayola Beginners markers& and these are much better. The fact that these markers are smaller& enables the child to have better grip and control over them. They come with 14 colours so plenty to use and loose! It is great they are washable& as my daughter draws on her fingers/hands/feet/clothes& and we have been always to remove the stains by a simple rinse.Highly Recommended."
11512,3607,5," My son can color with these markers all day! The size is perfect for his little hands and he loves the bright colors. We are learning the names of the colors while he draws.They are extremely washable too& just a quick wipe with a cloth and any marks on the floor/wall/table go away. Washes out of clothes easily and washes off skin right away under the tap& if he chooses to color his arms!I am very happy with these. Crayola is a great company."
11513,3608,5," These Twistables coloured pencils by Crayola are very good. Useful with never needing to be sharpened and a great range of colours..and lots of shades.  I first bought a pack of 10& now increased with a pack of 30.  I mainly use them for the adult colouring books and it's so useful not having to sharpen& plus& after use& they twist down into their casing& away from risk of breaking the |leads|.My younger grandchildren love them too so they have their own packs of 10"
11514,3608,5," I use these for adult colouring books. Love this product because it's affordable and I don't have to sharpen the pencils (the best part). I haven't had a problem with the lead breaking& my only guess is the people got unlucky and the lead was already broken when they received it. I wouldn't hesitate to buy again.I only hope they bring out more colours/ shades and make the lead thinner for finer details. Great purchase and fast delivery& thanks!"
11515,3608,5," The best set of Crayola Twistables that I have bought yet. A really good colour range except for the browns& wish there were at least four different browns& it is so hard to colour all the trees in the background as well as the earth with just one brown."
11516,3608,5," Brilliant bought these for my daughter for school instead of felt pens and shes very happy with them uses all the time no sharpening or smudges lots of colours will be buying more of these ."
11517,3608,5," Excellent crayons. Really handy for slightly older kids.Thought these would be gimmicky and not hold up to regular use& but I was wrong.Would definitely buy again."
11518,3608,4," My 9 year old assures me that they are very good for drawing (and Perfectly twisty) but it is difficult to get a sharp point.  Probably slightly over-priced."
11519,3608,3," Was not as good as I had hoped. More like thin crayons than pencils as advertised& ends kept breaking. But the colours are good."
11520,3608,5," These are great& no mess& no fuss& my daughter and her classmates loves and uses only these for colouring& great idea!"
11521,3609,5," I haven't used them personally as they are gifts but they look great and the extra pens included was a good deal."
11522,3609,5," Made my daughter very happy"
11523,3609,5," Excellent product"
11524,3610,5," Prompt  delivery&  good value"
11525,3610,5," Great pens. Tip is quite fine and good for intricate bits on your drawing. Will be buying more."
11526,3610,5," Nice pens& arrived on time.."
11527,3610,3," Thin felts and light hope last a while"
11528,3611,5," Look good and hopefully the children I bouiight them for will love them too."
11529,3611,5," My son is an avengers fan"
11530,3611,5," Good quality pens"
11531,3611,5," Great product and great service"
11532,3612,5," the kids loved it hours of fun / quiet time& love the peace and quiet. told others about it. ??"
11533,3613,5," fab gift - couple of hours of fun!"
11534,3614,5," the colours are better and the covering power far superior to many more expensive |professional| pencils."
11535,3614,5," Product is excellent& service was excellent."
11536,3614,4," Good colours and easy to colour"
11537,3614,5," good all off them 10/10"
11538,3614,3," Missing a few colours - some were repeated!"
11539,3614,5," Perfect"
11540,3614,5," budding artist over the moon"
11541,3614,2," I returned this one because the pack is 24 pencils with 22 colours. I got 2 blue and 2 yellow pencils."
11542,3615,4," Great pens& bright colours and love the double tip& one finer than the other for great colouring!"
11543,3616,5," excellent just what I needed. delivery very prompt.excellent value for money"
11544,3617,3," Okay but not the way I remember it in days gone by. Relatively few pieces& possibly less robust than it could be and no longer affixed by pins - come on people - blue/white tack just doesn't work as well as the pins in a proper inboard backing used to. Probably a result of the overly protective health and safety people or some absurd EEC directive. Youngster hardly used it once a few failures with holding down the gears. Shame& I used to spend hours with mine as a kid.."
11545,3617,3," This brings back memories. The blue tac stuff that comes with it is essential to hold the outer wheel in place although you also have to use your non-writing hand to more fully secure the outer wheel. This can be tricky for younger kids. The real frustration is the carrying case - as other people have mentioned. The plastic wheel housings are too small& this puts pressure on the wheels& causing them to warp& which makes drawing more tricky than it ought to be. My recommendation is to throw the carry case away& so that no further damage occurs to the wheels. This is such a basic design fault in an otherwise fab craft toy. And it is annoying because I imagine the case is the biggest element of the cost. Eeeee by 'eck& they don't make things like they used to do."
11546,3617,3," This Spirograph would be great if it wasn't for one vital fault. The compartments in the case where the wheels are housed are too small. This compresses the wheels at the sides& warping the larger ones and making them all very difficult to get out of the box.Warped wheels are a serious problem because& during drawing& the notches on the wheels and on the ring don't meet& leading to slipping and ruining a pattern. As this appears to be caused by the box& the simplest solution would be to removing all the larger-medium sized wheels from their housing and store them elsewhere. But this then defeats the object of having a nice carrying case. Maybe the compartments could be user-stretched? I've been trying to do this and it's not working. So I may find another way of storing this set& something easy to carry round.Hasbro/Kahootz need to address this issue as it ruins an otherwise excellent set.My recommendation: purchase a vintage set."
11547,3617,5," This Deluxe fun Spirograph has all the wheels and cogs that I remember as a child. I bought it for my granddaughters 10 birthday and she has had hours of fun.The only down side is the price but I suppose you get what you pay for as this will last for years."
11548,3617,5," Great product. Its a classic that every kid will love but i feel that considering there isn't that much in the box & the price tag is a little high.Other than that i'm positive my daughter will love it and have hours of fun creating."
11549,3617,5," A great toy& I was never fortunate to have one as a child& but gave one as a Christmas gift and has given hours of fun& that doesn't involve a gaming station! Recommended"
11550,3617,5," Great toy just as I remembered as a child and my 9 year old is loving it as much as I did and still do& hours of fun& as described&  prompt delivery& faultless transaction 100% total ssatisfaction."
11551,3617,3," I bought this hoping to create some mandalas but it's not suitable for professional artwork& unfortunately.I had a Spirograph as a kid and enjoyed spending many hours creating colourful patterns& hence my decision to purchase one for my adult self. I was excited to receive it but& when it arrived& the parts seemed smaller than I remembered them - or is it just that I'm bigger? - and there are also fewer pens. Is it unreasonable to expect a wider selection of colours and larger parts in a 'deluxe' set? Apparently so...I wish someone would produce an alternative with the potential to create larger patterns& and with smaller holes for fine-tipped pens - or including specifically designed quick-drying gel pens in a range of colours. You could create some beautiful artwork with the right tool. Unfortunately& this isn't it.Still a good toy for kids& however& for whom it was obviously designed. That said& the inner parts do slip far too often - more often than I remember as a child& thus ruining the pattern& which is pretty frustrating. This could easily be avoided with a more complex design and& given the longevity of this toy& you'd think the producers would invest some money into redesigning it. If they don't& it will soon become obsolete as people instead turn to computer programs.3 Stars"
11552,3618,5," gotta have a steady hand to write on this... which I dont but geat gift idea nontheless."
11553,3619,4," My six year old loves it so I will not question it. Only think is& the side pocket does not really fit anything. It's supposed to be for the water bottle& I would expect but not even a pencil case fits.It holds A4 notebooks upright only."
11554,3619,1," My daughter does love the bag& however this is not good value for money.  She was given a duplicate gift from a high street catalogue shop.  The same bag was sealed in plastic and inside the bag was a stationary set and a purse....same price too.  Seems it is taken out of this bag when sold on Amazon.  Feeling ripped off!!"
11555,3619,5," The bag came very quickly and it is really nice product. My niece love it so much and she uses it for school."
11556,3619,5," My 7 year old loves monster high and so this was a sure-fire hit. She uses it as a school bag and she can fit everything in it with much trouble. Nice item. Very pleased with the purchase."
11557,3619,5," This is a brilliant item it came well within the estimated time (even at Christmas) it looked exactly like its picture and well worth the money.  Would recommend this item and seller."
11558,3619,4," my daughter loves her monster high messenger bag though maybe i should have read the deminsions before i ordered it was slightly bigger than i imagined but a good buy all the same"
11559,3619,5," bought this for my daughter to keep her tablet and charger and headphones in. Also fits colouring book& pencils and other important modern 7 y/o girl stuff. Well made. Recommend"
11560,3619,5," Better than expected for the price. Really good quality and my daughter loves it. Free delivery is good but be prepared to wait a week. Not a problem unless in a hurry"
11561,3620,5," My niece loved it."
11562,3621,4," Superb fun. Great smell. Huge interest in pencil case ("
11563,3621,5," Bought as part of christmas present for niece and she loved it.  Good price and delivered on time"
11564,3621,5," 10 year old daughter loves this. Great for the Smencils."
11565,3622,4," Really good markers. Washes out easily from clothes and skin. Unfortunately had to knock off a star as my 18 month old daughter managed to bite the tip off! Didn't think it was possible with it being flat& but she's always surprising me! Apart from that little blip& can't fault this. Need to grow a pair of eyes behind my back lol"
11566,3622,3," I think these are probably better suited for older toddlers. My son is 18 months but as soon as he gets these he draws all over himself or the carpet instead of the paper! They are washable& but it took several washes to get the darker colours off his hands. I now stick with the large crayola coloured pencils!"
11567,3622,5," You just cant beat crayola products. My 1yr old uses these well& these wash out of clothes so a happy mummy I am. The flatter nibs definately help my little one draw& colours are vibrant."
11568,3622,5," My son is nearly 2 and these pens are really easy for him to use. The nibs doesn't get damaged easily as he is quite rough with it. Washes off hands easily& not tried on clothes though."
11569,3622,4," These pens are quite good although that don't easily wash off! My daughter is able to use them and take the lid on and off"
11570,3622,5," These pens are great. Easy to wash off little hands and big enough for little hands to hold then. Well worth the money."
11571,3622,5," Great items& my 2 year old love them. Bright colors& easy to use. I love crayons& because it is always good quality."
11572,3622,4," Great for small hands and first step in encouraging colouring in a fun way to start using pens and pencils"
11573,3623,5," Well they certainly smell! Glad their packed into individual tubes as I would have been able to smell them through the box they arrived in. My son and daughter like them very much."
11574,3623,5," My 7 year old is now the envy of all his friends in school as these seem to be the latest craze - alot cheaper than some of the high street shops are selling them at!"
11575,3623,5," Great pencils. They smell absolutely brilliant and whenever I open my Son's bedroom door the smell hits you& in a good way!! Would highly recommend."
11576,3623,5," For my eldest- he loves them! And he loves the smell! (I don't). Delivery was good"
11577,3623,5," Very please with these they smell great"
11578,3624,5," Lovely gift set"
11579,3624,5," Fab little kit and great price saw this for double the price in mother care&"
11580,3624,5," Lovely little gift for my toddler"
11581,3624,5," Nice"
11582,3625,5," These pens are great for little hands as they are quite fat. My 2 yr old grandson loves them and finds them easy to use. No problems either with kids getting ink on their hands etc as it just washes away. Lots of lovely colours too.When my grandson uses them he tells you each colour he is going to use next& so they can be educational when they're learning to identify colours. All colours are very vivid too and a great amount of pens for the price!All in all a great buy!"
11583,3625,5," Great colours and so far are lasting and maintaining very accurate drawing.My son thinks they are great.Many&many thanks for good service"
11584,3626,5," Smiles all round on Christmas day with this fun and amusing pen. Good product that arrived very quickly and well wrapped."
11585,3626,3," I bought this as a joke for my brother after Movember. I must say I was a bit disappointed with it."
11586,3627,5," Fantastic"
11587,3628,5," Tried this as a replacement for a notice board I bought& found it to be great. This one has a fine nib so is better in some respects than the original& that is: the writing is easier to read.Will recommend this to anyone in the same position of having a notice board but no pen. It comes with it's own eraser within and is easy to use and wipe clean."
11588,3628,5," I have a big white board on my wall and a small A4 white board that I can carry around with me and jot on. The A4 board came with a little pen& but that broke soon after purchase so I had to use one of my big thick markers that I usually use on the big board. If anyone has used these before& then they will know how much they stink. It's not so bad when using them on the big board& but when your using them close to you& like I was when I write on the A4 board& then it becomes a problem. It came to a point where I was getting headaches& so I decided to get another pen. A smaller pen. I got this pen.It is perfect for writing on small surfaces. You can hold it exactly like a Biro and have maximum control. The nib is small so you can fit a lot of writing in if you have a small white board. It even comes with an eraser on the end. I have been using it for 4 months now and it is still going. Remarkably the eraser is still working too. I thought it would run out of use fairly quickly as it is not that big& but it is great. It doesn't reek like the big pens so this is exactly what I needed."
11589,3628,4," I don't know why this is rated as a toy. It's a very good white board marker and I was amazed at the speed of delivery and free postage. My own marker had dried up and I needed one urgently before Christmas. It came by return. Brilliant service."
11590,3628,5," This pen is not a toy& as other reviewers on here have commented.This is a basic-looking whiteboard pen that has a nice fine tip and the added benefit of an eraser on the back of it.  There's nothing particularly special about it& but it works really well and we're very happy with it.I cannot comment on the durability or lifespan of the product as we've only just received it& but all the indications are that it's good quality and should last a while.It's a bit bland looking& but looks like the picture.  If you're getting this for a child it wont excite them much& there's no pretty pictures on the pen."
11591,3628,5," I bought this pen for my niece to use with a 'Learn Your Times Tables' book. We had great fun.  Loved writing the answers& checking they were right& and then rubbing out and starting again.  Everyone in the family got tested. The pen is great& not too thick a nib& clean to use& and the fluffy eraser at the end so you can rub out and have another go.  Definitely recommended to make learning fun."
11592,3628,5," The nib is fine enough to allow for acceptable handwriting& but not so small that it would match a handwriting pen. Ink flows easily and judicious use of pressure should ensure that the nib/point doesn't 'fatten' out too soon. Ink is easily rubbed off when required and the included eraser pad is a nice touch at this price point. Used recently (but not often) so cannot comment on longevity."
11593,3628,2," The pen sounded like a great idea in principle& buy my son soon removed the eraser on the pen end just trying to use it and& although I was intending to stick it on with more glue& it was so small it got lost before I got the chance. The nib also got pushed into the pen barrel far too easily making the pen redundan within a matter of days. Save your money on this one!"
11594,3628,3," I needed this pen as my kid has one of those books where you trace the letters and then rub them out again afterwards. Unfortunately after just one hour& the rubber top had come off and I had to superglue it back.I would say that this pen is more suited to adults& as kids are heavy handed and this isnt going to last long."
11595,3629,5," Buy Melissa"
11596,3630,4," This is great for a night in! I always want to play this when I have friends around. It not a short game so make sure you have some time to finish playing it. The music clips are not too hard so it doesn't get boring (We hate it when we can't even get one question correct don't we?) but it is still challenging for the most ardent music fans. You will play this game again and again. So you music buffs buy this and have a few friends around and enjoy!"
11597,3630,5," We own Spot the Intro 1 and 2 and I'm just about to purchase number 3! They really are great fun for all the family& especially at Christmas although we dig ours out at regular intervals. All ages can join in as several decades are covered. Hilarious watching players hum to themselves with their hands over their ears trying to remember a tune when the next tune is already playing! A good |quality-time| game for all the family."
11598,3630,1," Not what I expected - after reading the instructions still didn't make much sense& you guess the name of the song& band or singer& but some of the answers were name of movies etc& but nowhere was this explained.  Very confused and found it too difficult for anybody under the age of 50 as not very many recent songs.  Maybe if I had brought the proper game with the board then used this as the extra music section only then would be worth buying& unfortunately we didn't."
11599,3630,3," Purchased game to play with adults at christmas.Good fun and stimulated lots of youthful memories and laughter. Downside is that intros are played very quickly after each other necessitating constant replays and pauses or it becomes frustrating as players have little time to write answer before next intro begins."
11600,3630,3," Not a bad game& quite fun but to be fair needs more up to date songs as well as some more well known older ones& we had a range of ages from 19 to 73 years old and the older generation did not know any of the answers and got bored and left the game heading for the kettle :("
11601,3630,3," This one was quite a bit cheaper than Spot the Intro 1 so that's  why I ordered it but on going through it the Spot the Intro 1 wasset out better and with better categories so made it easier to use for any age group."
11602,3630,4," Played this at Christmas with my family (aged 19-50) We all enjoyed it after a few drinks. Looking forward to round !!!"
11603,3630,5," Good service all round& arrived in time for christmas& kids loved it& purchased with spot the intro 1 and 2"
11604,3631,5," i bought this as a christmas present for my son but would be perfect for a girl too. got everything they need for class or home in n eeverything is moshi monsters these days so you can't go wrong"
11605,3631,4," Bought for grandson as he loves moshi monsters. It's a good pencil case& but could've had more items inside. But at least he's happy."
11606,3631,5," A great buy and it came thro the post in plenty of time. Will be able to add more pencils"
11607,3631,3," I've got this pencil case on sale when it was costing a bit over Â£4 so it was good value for money& I would definitely not pay more for it.My daughter who is Moshi Moster fan loves it of course& she can finally see at the end of the day when she is missing some pens or crayons and look for them what was impossible with the barrel style case she had previously.Although she loves it we are aware that it is not of the best quality. It feels quite flimsy and zips go all the way under the back of the case so we had to connect pieces of ribbon to them to make closing easier. The inside is made of canvas covered cardboard& it won't last.The crayons are very poor quality& covered in foil with Moshi Monster name& some of them had to be sharpened half way as they lead was all broken up inside.THe case comes with 8 crayons& 8 felt tips& 1 ball point pen& 1 pencil& Katsuma eraser& sharpener and a notebook."
11608,3631,5," Bought this for a Christmas present for my 5 year old nephew who is Moshi Monsters mad and he loved it"
11609,3631,4," My daughter loves the 2 compartments and all the stationary it comes with.  good quality case and adequate pencils and pencil crayons ."
11610,3631,4," Nice coulrful case with lots of room in it. Quality of included pencils isn't wonderful& but at the price perfectly good really."
11611,3631,4," purchased 3 of these as christmas presents& although a bit pricey they were good quality and colourful.i think they were filled with everything a child would need for school."
11612,3632,4," Fast delivery and the paints are exactly what I needed"
11613,3633,5," Great just what they wanted thank you"
11614,3634,5," If youâ€™re like me you can find being restricted to 1 or possibly 2 shades of a colour frustrating& especially when itâ€™s not the right shade!! Well this set of 100 different colours/shades is the answer! An incredible range of colours"
11615,3634,5," I have tried many felt tip pens and these are so much better than any of the others. Great choice of colours in lots of shades and true to the lid colour which really helps as some pens bear no resemblance at all to the lids.They are not dry like some can be& they have a fine tip for detail but if you tilt them slightly for filling larger areas they have enough juice to do that nicely."
11616,3634,5," Have previously always bought Staedtler just because I've used them before but the range of colours is really limited. Bought these on a bit of a whim as I liked the colour selection but they are brilliant. Great colour range although the lids really don't always correspond to the lids but this is not a big problem. They are nice to work with and the ink does not seap through the page. A great purchase would definately buy again for friends or family."
11617,3634,5," These pens are fantastic. The colours are vibrant& and colour beautifully  .I would recommend these & you would not be disappointed."
11618,3634,5," These are very nice& water based markers in a good range of colours. There are really 100 different colours in this set. I have recommended them in a colouring for grown-ups group on Facebook."
11619,3634,5," These were a stocking filler for Christmas& my daughter has used them a lot since then they seem to be of very good quality and have a nice thin tip.  They are a nice size to not to big and chunky great for small hands. She also loves the amount of various colours. Also it's good that they come in there own box."
11620,3635,5," These are absolutely great!!!  They are lovely and chuncky for gripping.  They arrive not too pointed& so they are not dangerous.  The pencil itself is softer than a normal pencil& but harder than a crayon& so they are safe& but give them a different writing experience.My daughter is nearly two and has had her crayola chunky crayons since she was 12 months& so we have just progressed onto these.  I would say this is about the right age as they are less chunky than the crayons& so a bit harder to grip and I think I would have been more nervous of her poking it in her eye at a younger age.  She loves these as she loves drawing and she finds these easy to hold and loves the diffent animals on each one.Every morning when we come downstairs I get asked for the pencils and she tells me their colour and the animal and even makes the animal noises...so they are much more fun than a normal pencil and so much safer.I have just ordered a pack for Nannie's and a spare for ours she loves them so much.Very highly recommended!"
11621,3635,5," Lovely pencils& very solid and the colours are bold. My 2 year old loves them& they are her favourite drawing tools! It would be good if Crayola made a pencil sharpener for them as they are thicker than a standard pencil& so far we have used a sharp knife which is not very convenient."
11622,3635,5," Bought this for my 12 month old after trying out others.  Am really pleased with the product as these are virtually indestructable"
11623,3635,5," I have an 18 month girl who loves drawing with aquadraw so I thought the next stage should be colouring pencils (also nice to be able to stick the pictures on the wall instead of her drawing on the walls!)The pencils are great& chunky enough for her to grip& they have pictures of different animals on the pencils so we use them too as a learning tool.Really would recommend them especially at the price they are."
11624,3635,5," My little one is only 16 months but she loves playing with these pencils.  THey're easy for her to grip and the animals on them mean you can ask her to bring a colour or an animal pencil.  I'd definitely recommend these."
11625,3635,3," My 3 year old grandson absolutely loves these pencils - they are easy to hold and the colours are vibrant.  We have enjoyed hours of fun using them and they are by far the best drawing materials I have found to date.  In fact his mum was so impressed that she bought a 2nd set for him to use at home.All the fun came an abrupt end when they needed sharpening because I have been unable to find a sharpener that fits the pencils& so I sent an email to support@vividstore.co.uk the customer service link on the Crayola website.  I have just received an email from Crayola suggesting I buy the swordfish plastic pencil sharpener priced Â£3.87 from Amazon or find an alternative in Rymans& Smiths or Staples.  At that price I would sooner buy a new set of pencils.  Poor show Crayola how about including a pencil sharpener in the set since it is unlikely that the sharpener would fit any other pencils."
11626,3635,5," As in all the comments above& these colouring pencils are just great for little ones - easy to grip and don't slip.Our daughter has had them for 6 months& since she was a year old. We started off with crayons but she ate them and broke them in half. Then tried these -won't go back.The tip of these does not break so easily& even when she throws them and they land on the tip. Meaning you don't waste the pencil sharpening it to get a tip. In fact this is the feature i love most about them. Definitely worth it!"
11627,3635,5," These chunky pencils for children are really lovely. They have a natural wooden appearance with little pictures printed on them - ducklings on the yellow pencil& monkeys on the brown etc. The |lead| is quite soft and gives a great intense colour& especially if they are pressed firmly. The thicker than usual size means you can't use a normal sharpener& but you can easily buy a sharpener for chunky pencils here on Amazon! Here are some Portable Stationery Snail Shape Dual Holes Green Clear Manual Pencil Sharpener Blue Clear Handheld 2 Holes Flip Top Pencil Sharpener"
11628,3636,2," Sorry but I feel they are Not worth the money. the size of the actual pen is very  small more like the size of the free pen you get in Argos& the tips  are very thin you can only use them to write with not colour in a picture."
11629,3636,5," Good value and arrived quickly.  Grandson's extra birthday present - he seemed pleased with them."
11630,3636,5," Haven't used them as Christmas gift but they look nice."
11631,3636,5," All looks fine.  Not opened as they are a present"
11632,3637,4," pleased with product just wish you hadnt stuck your returns label onto bottom of item as when i tried to remove it it tore the pink cover such a shame but luckily wont show good value"
11633,3637,5," For a five year old wanna be princess this was heaven in a box she loved it. It had more than I expected was wonderful."
11634,3637,5," Fab xx"
11635,3638,5," I bought a couple of these kits along with fabric pens and several t-shirts for my 11 year old grand-daughter before christmas.The pens are easy to use and surprisingly with a little care mess free& although they do require a fair bit of puff!The stencils included stick to the shirt well and peel off after painting& this means that the stencil shape is left the colour of the shirt rather than the shape itself being painted. We did manage to remove the stencil shape and leave the hole so that the shape itself could be painted but this was little more difficult especially with the more intricate shapes.She made 3 t-shirts as presents for her little sisters and cousin and has just created two for herself. The results are excellent and very wearable.I would recommend placing card between the two layers of the t-shirt before spraying.The garment has to be ironed after spraying to make the paint wash proof& two t-shirts have been washed and come out fine.I also purchased some Giotto fabric pens for fine detail which is also an excellent product.Excellent value for money product at the price I paid which was less than Â£3 per pack. At the current price which is double what I paid I may have hesitated not knowing what they were like. However I will be purchasing more (but maybe not so many) as my grand-daughter wants to make t-shirts for her friends."
11636,3639,5," Weirdly it has been these pens that have really sparked my son's interest in getting down to do his homework. He has produced some magnificent posters for science& history and geography as well as his favourite hobby of cartooning. He even looks after them and puts them away afterwards which is a first. The pens blend well& are easy to handle and the colours are vibrant. I would definitely recommend investing in these over any number of cheaper felt tip colours for the same cost. The pens will bleed through standard paper and mark the surface underneath so either invest in a good quality ream of A3 or make sure that your table is otherwise protected. Have yet to run dry despite extensive use."
11637,3639,5," Great pens& they have a pointed end for detail and a flat end for colouring larger areas& they are great& blender pen is a good extra and fades colour out well. However they won't last long as my son has been doing graffiti styles in his black book since arrival and the mauve is nearly run out. Will be ordering more for sure."
11638,3639,5," These are not your average Felt-Tip pens. The price might lead you to that conclusion anyway. They originated as - and still are - professional tools for Graphic Designers who were / are familiar with Letraset's Pantone (R) colours& which were the standard for Print. These are serious Artist's tools& (hence the 'Pro' in the name perhaps) and are manufactured with that in mind. So don't buy these if all you want to do is block-fill the inside of the black lines in a child's colouring book. The ink is specially formulated and the Blending Pen is a useful tool for avoiding having to purchase other Pens in intermediate spectrum colours. The Blending pen needs to be cleaned to eradicate unwanted colour that it will accumulate.Letraset's original Pantone Markers (single tip) and their follow-up |TRIA| format (with 3 standard& ultra-fine and wedge tips) also had the option of using a specifically-designed Airbrush attachment. Although the Pens here look exactly like the Tria& I don't know if they are tooled to fit the Airbrush adaptor for the Tria range& but I'm sure I'll soon find out. The adaptor is one of my prized possessions. It may be long out of production& so might be worth quite a bit :-)Durability: When used sparingly& for their intended purpose& they can last almost a lifetime. I have 3 original Pantone Markers which I've had since 1975 and even though I've used them sparingly they all work perfectly today. (2011)Educational: They do offer more realistic and subtle colour options with which to work. If a 12 pen set - all grey - makes you scratch your head& then they will help in teaching a child to look at colours in real life and to use the pens to realise shadings& tones and such. You never know...Read more â€º"
11639,3639,3," I really like these pens& and I will surely purchase them but different types in the future. The ones I got where alcohol based and I didn't really understand what that meant but probably they smelt like permanent markers. When I used them they leaked through pages and this was annoying when I was doing my card designs and journal work."
11640,3639,5," I love these pens.  I have used different ones and they are all similar.  The blender pen allows you to make light and shade effect and even my enhances my 'colouring in'Seriously& nice pens for the craft enthusiast  I use mine for card making"
11641,3639,5," Was very pleased with these pens as the had a thin end for that more detailed work and a wider end for the larger areas. I used these pens for my art project and it produced a very good quality. Great value for money."
11642,3639,5," Great colours and quality of ink/marker.Not only great for starting illustrators but also for professionals.Worth the price.Quick delivery& great condition.Recommended."
11643,3639,5," Had these a while now and they nevr fail to impress. about as far removed from the old felt pens as you can get. Easy and quick to use with great results. I'll be getting more colours soon."
11644,3640,3," not worth it postage made it pricey"
11645,3640,4," Nice but smaller than expected."
11646,3640,5," Great for grandchildren"
11647,3640,5," Great Christmas prezzy"
11648,3640,5," A*"
11649,3641,5," Smell great& bright colours& my daughter loves them. Highy recommend buying them."
11650,3641,3," these were lovely - I split a couple of packs out to put individual pens into party bags - but& out of 16 pens& 3 were dried up and useless on arrival.  Not good."
11651,3641,5," Came really quick! Love them& although the orange runs out quite quick.I highly recommend! :)Buy them they work great!"
11652,3641,5," My visually impaired daughter loves these!! We always have a game of |guess the smell|!...."
11653,3641,4," The grandchildren just love these great value for money and order was delivered very quickly"
11654,3641,4," They are very good pens and i really enjoyed them but i didn't get the bubblegum but instead got watermelon (which is my favourite but my friend has a bubblegum one and its amazing which made me dissapointed ):  )And they don't really smell that strong when i smell them on paper."
11655,3641,4," If you cant get hold of the better quality brand& due to expense then this is the brand that I would try.The scents are nice& but one or two arnt that great in scent& but young children wont be disappointed.Great colours& good scents. Good price. Quick delivery"
11656,3641,5," Super fast delivery and great pens. One happy little girl! A+++++"
11657,3642,5," I bought this pen to work with the Orbis Revell Airbrush Power Studio as the airbrush itself didn't come with a green pen and I have recently bought some flower stencils and needed a green colour for the leaves. Depending on how many layers you use you can get a reasonable dark green shade with the pen (although not as dark as I would imagine the actual dark green cartridge pen to go) and it obviously works perfectly with the Airbrush itself. My only 'niggle' I have about it is that the pen literally came as it is and with absolutely no packaging on it and not even a plastic seal around the pen and so potentially it could have been opened in the past by accident and have dried out before it reached me. Thankfully it hadn't and I can understand reducing packaging for the environment but even a plastic seal around the lid would have been a nice reassurance. The markings I have given are for the pen when used with the Airbrush and not for the pen alone which you couldn't use without the Airbrush anyway. A nice colour and at a reasonable price to work with the Airbrush. This cartridge pen is to use when doing drawings/shadings on paper and cardboard with the airbrush and you would need to buy other cartridge pens if using the Airbrush for tattoos& material or glass."
11658,3643,5," Love these and they are great for my latest addiction colouring in intricate patterns. Colouring is great relaxation therapy put somenice music on sit out in the sun and create beautiful patterns. Great range of colours and they don't run out straight away."
11659,3643,4," Lovely pen to colour with only wished they lasted longer"
11660,3643,5," I only ordered these pens yesterday and they were delivered today ( i.e. next day.) thank you& brilliant service. The colours are lovely and bright and I have tested them& they all work. I am really pleased& can't wait to start colouring with them."
11661,3643,5," They were for my daughter to do her course work& and she was over the moon with them& just what she needed."
11662,3643,5," Good range of colour too and includes glittery ones as well my 7 year old was thrilled with them ."
11663,3643,5," Good quality pens& delivered on time& and good range of colours. They were delivered safely and efficiently. Most pleased with goods and service."
11664,3643,5," Great for new hobby of colouring gives the pictures a different look"
11665,3643,5," Great item. A brilliant range of colours!"
11666,3644,4," I bought two of these. The only reason ive rated it 4 stars and not 5 is one of the boxes was very damaged !"
11667,3644,5," Great xmas gift for any child&has everything in it to be a budding artist&great value for money."
11668,3644,5," Nice item"
11669,3645,5," Great."
11670,3646,5," Brilliant"
11671,3647,5," these are really great new pens makes colouring in so much more fun"
11672,3647,5," Children got them for Christmas& great for a rainy day& the pens work as describe they are excellent"
11673,3648,2," The pencils are great but after being used for a while& realised that no sharpener will& fit these bulky triangular pencils...so unless you want to sit with a knife to sharpen& wouldn't recommend. Wish I'd known.."
11674,3648,5," These pencils are great for young kids or children who have difficulty grasping pencils correctly."
11675,3648,5," I bought these pencils for my 2 year old daughter& they probably a bit too big for her hands& but I was quite disappointed by all other kids-size pencils that you can't use for a long period time as they become too small. The triangular shape is what I was looking for& it really helps to teach the child how to hold the pencil. I like these pencils& they are bright& of a good quality and my daughter likes and uses them every day"
11676,3649,5," Chunky& bright& rich& vivid colour crayons& this brand is the best I have found yet. My 4 year old daughter loves them. Highly recommended."
11677,3649,5," I got these colouring in pencils for my 6yr old girl& well worth the money& keeps her out of mischief &â˜ºa word of warning tho&watch how you sharpen them&you will need a bigger sharpener because they could break quite easy"
11678,3649,5," Magnificent pencils& the colours that they produce on paper are great. Well worth the money when compared to some pencils that barely make a mark on the paper."
11679,3649,5," Perfect for a two year old and upwards. They are large and you will need a special sharpener& try the |Staedtler Double Hole|."
11680,3649,5," I've seen these pencils at my son's school and decided to buy as they looked so soft and nice for tiny hands. We both love them."
11681,3650,5," I have bought it for the second time for my grandson. It's very easy to use and to erase if any mistake is made. I have also purchased for other kids that really enjoyed it.Crayola products let the kids have fun whilst drawing and painting without making a mess."
11682,3650,5," My son who is 8 has always hated colouring until we had these pencils& now if he makes a mistake he can rub it out he is colouring alot more pictures for my wall than he used to&  his little sister is 2 and loves them aswell& even though she is more interested in pens at the moment. The colours are good"
11683,3650,3," These pencils are truely erasable - which is really unique. However I did not find the colours as intense (when marking glossy papered books - I underline books when studying) as with ordinary pencils. I found I had to push very hard to achieve a result - and still not good enough. I have not used them much because of this.However I think children would enjoy using them (on plain non glossy paper) as the erasable nature adds an extra dimension."
11684,3650,4," Bought this Crayola Erasable Pencils for my little boy to use to practise his penmanship. Let's face it& practise handwriting is boring stuff. Erasable colouring pencils is a good idea to raise his interests. I have to say these colouring pencils are not very good for writing& the tips are too soft and break easily. They are& however& very good for colouring. The colours really are erasable. They are also the cheapest erasble colouring pencils I can find. Overall& I am happy with it.P.S. I have since found a better erasable colouring pencil which can write well and colour well and erase well - Staedtler Noris Club Erasable Colouring Pencils Pack 24."
11685,3650,5," These are by far the best coloured pencils for kids on the market as they rub out !  Genius"
11686,3651,5," Much better than any I've seen in the shops. The Easter hat came back from school with all the chicks on it& but& strangely& the chocolate eggs I glued on next to the chicks were all missing!"
11687,3651,4," These chicks are very pretty though cost more than i wanted to spend but I wanted to get my daughter coloured chicks for her bonnet.I tied the chicks on to small nests with eggs with craft wire and added them to the bonnet."
11688,3651,5," it is a good item especially for easter bonnet parades. However they do not stick easily but what you should od is to stick themonot some tissue paper. overall it is a good product. Very young and colourful"
11689,3651,3," Not terribly good quality but only Â£1.50 so should not really complain.  Took ages to get here and missed my deadline to give to grandchildren by a week."
11690,3651,4," These are nice and cute.  I like the fact that they are different colours and not the standard yellow that you see everywhere.  I would buy again."
11691,3651,5," Many thanks for the quick response to my questions and fantastic customer service! We were really impressed and would definitely shop here again."
11692,3651,3," Nothing special but what we wanted to make my son's Easter bonnet for school. Nice to have a selection of colours rather than just yellow"
11693,3651,3," Received these in time for my Easter Egg Hunt with our grandchildren. These are so cute and colourful and have saved some for next year."
11694,3652,5," One thing everybody ought to know before they purchase these is that they are paint markers& NOT felt-tip pens or any variation thereof. As such& they can be purchased at most decently-connected art shops& and are by no means unique to this producer. That said& the price is quite good (regular paint markers can run up to 4.95 GBP each)& the colors are strong& and the application easy. I can't really think of any negatives here at all& although the panel-liner is a felt-tip that doesn't have a great deal of precision"
11695,3652,3," I haven't got much use out of these yet. The coloured markers come out quite vibrantly"
11696,3652,4," doesn't really stick that well& dpending on the surface& and two pens with the same silver (more like gunmetal actually) is a bit unnecessary& even them being different thicknesses. Otherwise& pretty good. Also keep in mind these are pretty thick& so not really meant for fine detail& although with a little fiddling and good precision you can get away with it."
11697,3652,4," These pens are ideal for colouring small areas that are not so easy with a brush.  The white however was a little patchy."
11698,3652,5," if you're not good at painting i greatly reccommend these pens! going have to buy more soon as i've been using it alot"
11699,3652,5," thanks for the great item perfect seller will defo use again A++++++++++"
11700,3652,4," nice quality pens& just waiting to use them"
11701,3652,4," Great markers. For painting only."
11702,3653,5," Great product& fast efficient service"
11703,3654,5," just as described!it is a Xmas present for my 7 years old nice so I don't know if she will love it but it looks great& beautiful one and it arrived well packaged and promptly."
11704,3655,5," What's not to love it's pink& holds stationary"
11705,3655,5," :)"
11706,3656,5," Met all expectations"
11707,3657,5," Super soft pencils& bright and colourful.  A little bit more than your average pencils but& last quite a long while as they don't break everytime you sharpen them!"
11708,3657,5," I am impressed with the quality of those pencils. They are really soft and the colours are bright and strong. I highly recommend."
11709,3657,3," bought these to accompany the books.  My little girl loves them but they really are top priced crayons nothing special."
11710,3657,5," These are a good quality set of pencils which work brilliantly with the Top Model books.  We also bought the skin and hair colours too.I think you pay a little extra for the name but as it was for a present I wanted them all to go together.Would recommend this product for any Top Model fan"
11711,3657,5," My Daughter has a vast range of the TopModel mags an bits n bobs and have bought many sets of the felt tip pens. She gave these a go and was very pleased on how it blends nice with soft tones instead of always being bold with the felt tip ones."
11712,3657,4," I bought this set and the 'skin and hair' set& bit pricey but offers more appropriate colours. Although for clothes designs ordinary crayons would be ok. This was part of a christmas present so was worth the extra cost."
11713,3657,5," My 5 year old girl looks these pens& I bought them with a few of the top model books and we have spent hours painting.. ( I love it even more than my daugher.. ha& ha!)"
11714,3657,5," Great colours. Good details achieved.  Daughter really enjoys using them.  Creating unique designer clothes for her top models.  Used them along with top model book."
11715,3658,3," This item is not as described! Clearly says on Amazon description (and on the box) that it is over 3' tall when it is inflated.Someone needs to learn how to use a tape measure as it is actually only 21| tall - not even 2'.Can't believe the other reviews fail to mention thisApart from that the product is pretty good and will do the job. However& I am slightly disappointed as it lacks the impact I was hoping for and I feel misled. Can't be bothered returning it etc. Would have  given 5 stars if it was truly as described. Don't understand why people need to blatantly lie about their products - really puts me off buying online anything I haven't seen in person before-hand."
11716,3658,4," Bought this as a bit of a joke as the skittle team I play for had just won a promotion.Stood and went down well (not literally) on our last game of the season. Could not find a marker pen that wouldstay on and able to wipe off after. Nice size and served it's purpose. Maybe we will need it again next season!!"
11717,3658,5," Very good quality& have bought two so far. You can write on the trophy with a non-permenant pen but if you write on it frequently it is hard to remove all traces of the pen!  Great for the purpose I purchased them for."
11718,3658,1," air hole was blocked so had to dig around with a pen for ages to make one& and then a hole appeared from no where so had to put a plaster on it so it stayed up for at least 3 mins while we gave it to recipient"
11719,3658,5," perfect trophy for our tell a joke competition at our christmas party&this is the second time i have purchase this item cant bet it&Fantastic product for a blow up trophy"
11720,3659,5," Those crayons are nice. My little daughter is exploring her world and paining everywhere... well& this crayons are water soluble& meaning I can get it off most surfaces. Amazing."
11721,3660,5," Stocking filler for my Lego loving daughter.  She loves them because they are Lego.  Good novelty present& not much else to say!"
11722,3660,5," Stocking filler for my lego addicted daughter - quick delivery"
11723,3660,5," Put in my daughters birthday party bags for her friends. Good quality pencils and all the girls seemed happy with them."
11724,3660,5," Used as party bag items along with the lego friends lego brick rubbers. Girls loved them and they were good quality."
11725,3661,5," Excellent quality and very easy to use. If you want more fine lines easy to put on different size nozzle. Happy with purchase."
11726,3661,5," Lovely& the flow is fine and smooth& great product& thank you."
11727,3661,5," Great product - works well for its designed purpose."
11728,3661,5," Easy size to hold and control the use of"
11729,3662,5," Great fun! These pens work brilliantly to create fabulous stencil pictures. Only downside for me was that the box shows an Aerial stencil and this isn't included in the pack which annoyed my 3 year old!"
11730,3662,3," Nice colours but a couple of the pens didn't work luckily those were the colours we had left from a previous set my granddaughter loved the stencils"
11731,3662,5," Great fun. Pens can be used on their own to colour as well as to blow through. Good choice of stencils."
11732,3662,4," Gift was for my 6 year old niece's birthday& She really liked them and so did her little sister.. Delivered on time and kept a 6 and a 4 year old out of trouble for a while!I think the stencils would be better made out of plastic or something& not sure they will last that long but do wipe clean nicely."
11733,3662,4," My 5 year old loves these! Once she got the hang of how to work it she created some cute pix"
11734,3662,3," Brought my little girl great idea as remembered them from when I was little but these were really hard for her to blo"
11735,3662,3," Daughter of 5 found them quite hard to use... Enjoyed them but she got bored and puffed out after 15 minutes"
11736,3662,2," Ridiculously expensive for a tube of plastic with an ink pad in it. Paying for the disney name."
11737,3663,5," This was a brilliant buy! My children absolutely loved it! The pens provided were fantastic quality and after being a bit worried it wouldn't be very sturdy& i was pleasantly surprised. After 3-4days of pretty much constant use it did start to break a bit& but nothing a bit of gaffa tape didn't fix! I plan to get another one for the summer holidays and will probably just put gaffa tape on to begin with."
11738,3664,1," would not reccomend  this very expensive price for a few pencils picture very misleading looks like a box of pencils when only just a handful very poor"
11739,3664,5," The other reviewers are giving these pencils low marks just because the price is so high.  Yes& the price at Â£5+ is high (it does dip down occasionally if you watch it)& but you have to keep in mind that if you buys these pencils& you are paying a PREMIUM for having gorgeous horse pictures printed on the sides of colouring pencils.  If you have an art"
11740,3664,1," You only get a few pencils with this. The picture suggests a beautifully boxed& packaged gift. It is worth about 50p not nearly Â£6 including postage. I would have sent this back were it not so close to Xmas and it's too late now. I will never use the Internet for shopping again. It's just a way of off-loading tacky rubbish and charging vastly over the odds for it. Please& nobody else be fooled like I was."
11741,3664,4," These pencils I felt were a little bit expensive for what they are& but I guess its because they have horses on them! My 11 year old horse mad daughter was very happy with them I would have been happier if they were more reasonably priced!"
11742,3664,5," ordered these as a birthday present for my daughters friend.  the looked good quality and were reasonably priced so I'm sure she loved them.  Have ordered again for another friend."
11743,3664,5," good pencils& girls love the pictures as well.have done a lot of colouring since getting them. can recommend them to  any body who wants special pencils for horse mad girls"
11744,3664,5," Horse mad daughter Christmas stocking gift (good old Santa) came sharpened too so no mess or early morning hunting for a sharpener. Great colouring pencils too."
11745,3664,4," Bought as a gift& so don't know how good a quality they are but the little package is quite cute and the detail on the pencils means that at least they won't be mixed up with others pencils at school."
11746,3665,5," kids loved the smell& me - not so much lol. lovely items and comes individually with their own little boxes& amazing."
11747,3665,5," I bought these as a present for my colleague for her birthday. I couldn't resist smelling them myself& the cupcake one smells amazing! The price isn't to bad on them and it does make a nice little gift for someone. My colleague enjoyed smelling them and guessing what scent it was. All in all good smallish gift for a cheap price."
11748,3665,5," Bought one in USA looked around then found here&great Wife likes"
11749,3665,5," excellent service& product and value"
11750,3665,4," My daughter was thrilled with these pencils. They appear to be the latest craze amongst her friends!  Each pencil comes in it's own plastic tube which seems to apeal hugely to users. The pencils have kept their scents and she has had a lot of fun guessing which smencil she chose by smell alone."
11751,3665,5," My Grandaughter loved them"
11752,3665,5," love these& smell lush"
11753,3665,5," Absolutely fantastic they really do smell packaging brilliant"
11754,3666,4," These markers were a lot of fun and easy to use. They also come with good instructions. I don't know how they wear in the long term& but the directions were easy to understand and easy to do. I also used them at another party to decorate t-shirts and they were a hit there too. They are easier and less messy than the puffy paint fabric paints."
11755,3666,5," great pens great to use for personlized presents for my friends really unusual quality really good  would recommend this product. ten out of ten"
11756,3666,5," Great product - I thoroughly recommend these markers for all small projects!!  The colours are vibrant and easily transfer onto any fabric I have used."
11757,3666,5," really good colour and easy to use washed the item and the colour was still vibrant& excellent for use on t-shirts."
11758,3666,5," I bought these fabric markers to draw the designs for mine and my friends leavers shirts and have been quite impressed by the results they have given. I have drawn desings onto three shirts& all A4 sized& and the pens have not run out yet. The pens do not bleed easily if you allow time for each layer to dry (blending pens is a little more difficult). Hopefully we shall get good compliments on the designs on our last day!"
11759,3666,4," We decorated some onesies.  The black marker bleeds quite a bit.  The green marker was a bit dried out even the first time we used it.  But the results were beautiful anyway.  I'm not sure how well they will survive the wash."
11760,3666,3," The pens are not that good the yellow ran out immediately I may just be unlucky though as Crayola is a good make"
11761,3666,5," Bought for 11 year old nieces to decorate a dance bag - perfectEasy to use - would recommend placing item to be drawn on onto a piece of protective cardboard"
11762,3667,5," ... and these little things helped our little cherub feel and see the difference when he holds a pencil using these grips& rather than just wrapping his fist around it.  Still got a way to go before he always writes letters and numbers legibly& but he now knows he can."
11763,3667,5," Excellent. Has helped so much"
11764,3667,5," I bought for my son (5 year old) 5 types of grips (as he has a serious problem to hold pencils& problems with his co-ordination and grip)& this one is the one he prefers and really helps him the most"
11765,3667,5," great item"
11766,3667,5," great"
11767,3668,5," Cheap pens. Washable. My 18 month old draws on her face& hands& my fabric sofa& rugs& but if you use wet cloth to scrub it& the colour comes off easily."
11768,3668,5," Fantastic."
11769,3668,4," Nice chunky pens for little hands but he large nibs and wetness of felt tips mean they get everywhere. The toddlers love them though and thank goodness they're washable!"
11770,3668,5," These are excellent.  They really are washable from every surface.  They are also very robust so toddlers can't damage the nib by pressing too hard."
11771,3668,5," these are great can let the 2 year old play  with them and it all washes off"
11772,3668,5," Very pleased and so is my grandaughter easy to use with small fingers"
11773,3668,5," Perfect for what I wanted! Wash off really easily& even fabrics"
11774,3669,5," Wee girls loves it as it's FROZEN. what else can I say. All works without any problems. Quite thin and cheap looking but does the trick for a wee girl and that price"
11775,3669,4," Ok pens plenty of colours daughter liked them"
11776,3669,5," Good. I got a full refund. Would recommend."
11777,3670,5," My son loved this"
11778,3671,5," I bought this as a christmas present last year for my nephews and they have had a great time roll playing with them - bit expensive for what they are but the kids like them!"
11779,3671,3," Outfit is ok but very cheap looking& will do the job for world book day. The glasses are far too big and very wonky so can't be used. Probably would of been better to buy the cape"
11780,3672,5," children love it"
11781,3673,5," Very good toy for children's development."
11782,3674,5," 2nd one of these I've bought now. First for my son& second as gift. Nice bright object. Great for 1+. Keeps them busy but also good looking toy for the home."
11783,3674,3," Not as nice as the cheese and mouse as the string is simply tied to one of the holes so always comes off.  Nice attractive toy otherwise."
11784,3674,3," Brought for Xmas for a 1 year old and a sibling of 3 years but so far not been played with much. Its a lovely solid item and tactile to touch. I'm hoping it will have more interest later on as they grow up....or maybe they won't!"
11785,3674,5," A fab bright chunky toy& bought for my 2 year old who is loving the Very Hungry Caterpillar story at the moment& so we use this as a prop when we read it. Looks good enough to eat!"
11786,3674,5," Awesome little Buy& Perfect for hand eye coordination& Brightly coloured and really fun"
11787,3674,5," We have been spending a lot of time 'sewing' with this apple& great stocking filler!"
11788,3674,5," Very good quality product. Agree with other reviews about needing to secure the chord well& but is not a problem. Ideal for young nephew - easy to hold and manipulate with adult help."
11789,3674,5," Excellent quality toy. Good for co ordination and motor skills. Great price would recommend."
11790,3675,5," Decent size& great price"
11791,3676,5," This is a lovely music box.  The triangle and tambourine are great.  The cymbals are not very loud though! I bought this set as I was looking for wooden sticks& as my daughter loves banging sticks together at the music group we go to.  All in all the set is of great quality and well worth the money."
11792,3676,4," We've bought quite a few Melissa and Doug toys over the years and have been very happy with them so my daughter bought this as a birthday gift for her four year old cousin.In the very nice velvet lined box you get several basic musical instruments.- Clacker- Cymbals- Tambourine- Tone blocks- Maracas- TriangleThe instruments are well made and feel nice in the hand. In use the clacker& tambourine& tone blocks and triangle make a good sound. The maracas are a bit quiet and could do with more rice or seeds inside them to give them more of a 'shic shac' and the cymbals are a tad tinny to be honest. But overall this is a great little set to introduce music/sounds and rhythm to a child.Recommended"
11793,3676,2," The material quality is good but the scales of the instruments are relatively small compare to the real one. The best thing in this box is the triangle which is same size as the real one. The worst item in this box is the cymbals& they do not make a noise."
11794,3676,4," It's the best quality I have seen so far for instruments. I gave 4 stars due to lack of cover on the box. My daughter loves sitting in the box herself while playing instruments-just what you would expect from 1 year old."
11795,3676,1," This set looks fantastic and comes beautifully packaged in a lovely wooden box& but once it's unpacked the quality of the instruments is disappointing.  The tambourine is tinny& the cymbals are flimsy& the maraccas are very quiet& and the clacker didn't clack.  It looks like great value but you get what you pay for.  In future we would buy individual instruments that might actually get played with since they make a good sound!"
11796,3676,5," The quality is great. wish maracas made more noise but overall very satisfied. packaging is great and instruments colourful and adequate for children."
11797,3676,4," This is a great little set and it's good value for money.  We only received ours today but it seems well made and compared to your average children's instruments& they all sound good too.  The shakers are disappointingly quiet (but we have a house put of plastic bottles filled with pasta and rice so shakers are not what we need!!) but the selection of intruments and their sounds make up for it.  Very pleased with this set.Big Zing time :o)"
11798,3676,5," Bought this for my three children aged 4&6 and 8. They all love it and enjoy making music and noise together."
11799,3677,4," This is a fun toy that any Disney Princess/Palace Pet fan will enjoy. It is very responsive to touch so younger children won't get frustrated trying to press the pictures to get a response. The slide at the bottom is also easy to move."
11800,3677,5," Granddaughters love this"
11801,3678,4," Much more robust than others I have bought for my granddaughter (other than the red version of this one) but it has yet to become her favourite.  I'm hoping that this& in being more robust will& therefore& last for more than a little while."
11802,3679,5," on time and excellent condition& a gift which was very well-received!Exactly as advertised& a beautiful little top& well worth the cost."
11803,3679,5," This is a great little spinning top& small and robust and ideal for my grandchildren.  A four year old can easily operate it."
11804,3680,5," The blocks arrived safely and come in a sturdy wooden storage box. They are beautifully illustrated and are just the right size for little hands. I bought two& one for a friend of my daughter and one for my nephew. I am sure they will love them and I will definitely buy another set. The blocks are super value for money& no bells& no whistles& or batteries needed! I adore Melissa and Doug products they never fail to delight!"
11805,3681,5," This is the second Tangle I've owned.  The first was the Tangle Relax& and I'll compare this one to my Relax.This Tangle is durable.  The Tangle Relax has a rubbery (but not sticky) texture& this Tangle is made of hard plastic.  I still love the Relax& and I bought a replacement for it& but it's not going to last forever. I assumed that would be the case when I bought it.  If long-term durability is important for you& this one is better.This Tangle is easy to keep clean.  I love the way the Relax feels& but it's surface makes it less than ideal at times.  It would get dirty& and after awhile& it started looking permanently dirty.  This one is better for taking out and about& shoving in pockets or purses& and for places with lots of germs.This Tangle stays posed.  I don't know how to explain it& but the Relax is floppy.  You don't even have to shake it to get it to lose it's form.  This Tangle can be posed and will stay put.This Tangle doesn't necessarily match the picture.  This is a big deal for some& and not a big deal for others.  I enjoyed the surpise& but others may want something more specific.  Also& if you want |girl| colours or |boy| colours& there are other sellers who offer that.This Tangle doesn't lay flat.  The Relax comes with exactly 20 pieces& and you can put it in shapes that lay perfectly flat.  This one has 18 pieces& so I'd either have to remove two pieces or buy a second and add two peices to make it lay flat.Buying a second might be a good idea anyway.  If this is your first Tangle& be prepared for people to ask to hold it and play with it.  This always drives me a bit crazy& and I like having a |backup| when possible.  Also& it's not good to have one break when you rely on it like I do.Read more â€º"
11806,3681,5," I brought this for a little boy with autism he loves the tubular feel of this and it seems to work at calming him down for short periods which is helpful to his mum. This was great for him because regular toys do very little to engage him."
11807,3681,5," I ordered theses items for my son who has asd and also for my  resource bag as i work with special needs children absolutly fantastic to keep them entertained will deffenetly be ordering more ."
11808,3681,5," really good for my neuro-typical 7yr old who has destructive tendencies when his hands are bored. arrived within a week and was smaller than it appears& but just the right size for my son& pretty good all round :)"
11809,3681,5," My son has ASD and suspected ADHD. This little thing is amazing for fiddle value - you can twist it& take it apart& reconstruct it - its fabulous! Great for improving dexterity as well. Big hit."
11810,3681,3," I bought one of these for my 3 year old autistic nephew& and my sister reports it does seem to ease his stress at entering new situations - but is easily lost as it is so small.  I also expected the tangle to have different textures - but mine was just a smooth&hard plastic with black and yellow sections.  An okay product."
11811,3681,5," Great product. I will be getting many more for all my students with ADHD& DCD (Dyspraxia) and Aspergers/Autism/NLD. This seems most interesting to people with Aspergers& autism and NLD (some Dyspraxics too if they have issues regarding heightened sensitivity. This one can pop apart a bit too easily if the untextured ones are not evenly distributed between the textured ones."
11812,3681,1," The product was not what was pictured& the product shown has differently textured portions&the toy that arrived was completely smooth. I it bought from midco toys and would advise anyone to be weary if this seller."
11813,3682,5," Set includes:Dumper TruckCement MixerBulldozer ('Digger')The construction vehicles in this set each consist of 5 take-apart pieces (supporting early numeracy  targets of counting up to 5 using 1:1 correspondence). Everything is chunky and well-made. Where the vehicles have been painted& the colours are bright and appealing& but it's nice to see that some sections retain their natural wood effect. Once assembled& the scoop section of the bulldozer can be moved up and down."
11814,3682,4," Our 3 year old grandson really liked this very solidly constructed toy set and was soon trying all possible ways to assemble the individual vehicles. It clearly helps to improve shape recognition and assembly skills."
11815,3682,4," is a firm favourite of mine when it comes to buying gifts. My Son now has around 10 different puzzles and toys from them and they look nice& withstand his sometimes aggressive play and always ensure there is a fun learning aspect at the same time. These stacking vehicles are no different but I do prefer the Train which we have and have given as a gift twice and always becomes a firm favourite. None the less this is money well spent and any little boy would be happy to receive this."
11816,3682,5," Bought this for a Christmas gift so have not actually opened the packaging. However& through the cellophane it looks like a sturdy& well constructed toy. It looks larger than I thought it would be and I think the 2.5 year old boy we bought it for will love it! My daughter has the Melissa and Doug stacking train& which is really good quality and an excellent toy too"
11817,3682,5," I bought these for a friends child but wish I had bought them for mine too as they are lovely. Well made& nice colours& not plastic and interactive as there are components that come off in order to stack again. Lovely."
11818,3682,5," It is a Christmas present so the child hasn't seen it as yet.  It looks well built& the colours are nice and bright and the size is just right for little hands. I am sure he will get lots of play out of this."
11819,3682,5," I cannot recommend these toys enough. My construction vehicle mad 2year old adores them and they have become a firm favorite. When they arrived I was suprised as they are alot bigger than I expected& which is great for clumsy little hands. Nice and chunky and easy for little ones to disassemble and reassemble and lovely bright colours. I really love these and any toddler would& I will certainly be purchasing more similar ones from M"
11820,3682,5," My grandson age 2 loves these and plays with them every day. Sometimes he stacks them (always in their original order)& sometimes he races the bare bogies. They are one of his favourite toys. Well made and strong for little hands."
11821,3683,5," I bought these for my son last Christmas (he was 4 months old).  As soon as he was crawling he was able to play with them - rolling them and following them across the floor.  They kept him amused for ages considering a baby's usual attention span.  He also loved peek a boo games with them (hiding smaller pots inside bigger ones): cue squeals of delight as the smallest pot reappears!  He is now 15 months old and they are still a favourite: he can stack them or spends up to 20 minutes just working out which ones fit inside each other |nesting| them.  They are great for learning about colour and size& as well as developing motor skills.  The cups work well as bath toys as they have holes in the bottom.  Forget about flashing noisy toys& these cheap but durable cups will provide hours of fun.  I will be buying them for friend's babies from now on.  I can not recommend them enough!"
11822,3683,4," Not much& really. Simple& colourful& appears durable and more lasting enjoyment than the box (which is more than can be said for some expensive toys)."
11823,3683,2," Good stacking cups& my little one loves them. When I opened the pack& one of the cups was disformed and cracked& which meant I couldn't give it to my little boy. Also means that they won't stack properly& as it is now missing one."
11824,3683,5," These are just normal stacking cups but have animal figures at the base of the cup which really intrigues my then 9 month old. She is 14 months now and its still her favorite toy...what else can I say? Total value for money."
11825,3683,5," My 5 month old Grand Daughter loves watching me build them for her to knock down but as she gets older I will enjoy teaching her to build them herself& teaching her colours and counting the cups. Very versatile toy can be used any where (bath&sand pit etc) easily cleaned and stack inside each other so don't take up room in her toy box. Definitely would recommend this toy& great value for money."
11826,3683,5," I bought these for my 8 month old& he is still fascinated with them at 9 months and can't get enough of hiding them inside each other& knocking over towers& and feeling the animal outlines. I like the bright colors and the fact that they are not made in China (made in India) which is so hard to find with plastic kids toys these days."
11827,3683,2," I don't know why these have such great reviews. They only stack if you push them together (very firmly) to form a solid column that is no fun to be knocked down by a baby. She watches me stack them and always likes to try and remove the one I just put on& and the whole tower comes with it."
11828,3683,4," Quite a bit smaller than i though it would be but my daughter loves the bright colours and feeling the little animals at the bottom of them. Had to clean"
11829,3684,4," Really like the design of these cars"
11830,3684,4," Decent enough product. They came up when I searched for items suitable for 6months plus though& and the packaging says 12m. So that was frustrating and worth being aware of."
11831,3684,5," Ideal gift encourages interaction and stacking aspect helps hand eye coordination"
11832,3684,4," Bought as a gift. Looks nice and well made (was smaller than I thought it would be). Haven't had any complaints."
11833,3684,4," Bought as a birthday present& they are a good size for little hands to hold."
11834,3684,5," Lovely set of wooden cars& would make a great little gift."
11835,3685,4," Brought it as a present for my 5 year old son. He loved it"
11836,3685,3," My dughter is beyblade crazy and she asked me to purchase this for her.When we received the item the delivery was quick and well packaged.You get 2 beyblades with the set and the arena the beyblades are of ok build quality but the arena has a domed bottom and rocks all over the place when the blades are fighting.My daughter didn't like the area and replaced it with a flat bottom one.All in all its an ok set for beyblade fans but i would look at other sets before this one."
11837,3685,2," My 10 yr old son really wanted this but has played with it only once. Not much to it. At least the price wasn't too bad..."
11838,3685,5," Placed my order on a Saturday and was delivered the following day!! Have a very happy little boy.....thank you"
11839,3685,3," Would never have paid full price for this as you only get two bay blades and a cheap bit of moulded plastic."
11840,3685,5," Purchased for child's xmas present. Delivered v quickly within 2days. Looks good."
11841,3685,5," Great toy. Son loves it and plays nearly daily alone as well as with friends."
11842,3685,4," My grandson enjoys playing with Bey Blades. Value for money."
11843,3686,5," Bought for my 1 year old for Christmas - he loves it. I was impressed by the quality for such a low price and was really pleased that it's made from wood rather than plastic.Overall& very happy."
11844,3687,5," This is the 2nd product I have ordered from this supplier and whilst a long delivery is quoted (7 - 23 days) both have arrived within 7 - 10 days.  Very well packaged and protected especially since they come from China.  Son is very happy with beyblade and is the envy of his class mates."
11845,3687,5," This beyblade is a really strong and fantastic beyblade.Both me and my little brother love it!I would definitely recommend this beyblade to all balance type lovers."
11846,3687,5," This was my first bey and I really enjoyed playing with it.It is a good attack strategy type.I have more beyblades now though and fang leone beats them all&I have kerbecs& screw capricorne&basalt horogium and meteo l Drago it sometimes beats. I love it!"
11847,3687,5," Nice product& nice little note from the company explaining why the delivery time can be somewhat extended. The delivery was a few days left but I think was more up to the postal services here in Sweden.My son will totally enjoy this blade. Original package and working and looking great!"
11848,3687,5," The timescale given for delivery was after Christmas which was both helpful and fine with me. The packaging used was good quality and the item arrived in brilliant condition. My Nephew loves it! I will order from you again! Thank you very much!"
11849,3687,5," He gave it 5 stars as it met his expectations. Thinks its the coolest thing since it beat out his friends beyblades. Even more so& I will order another one if he does well at school. Already ordered another as another gift to his friend."
11850,3687,5," My 9 year old son was over the moon when he received this beyblade from Hong Kong& the price was very good compared with other places we checked. The only snag was that when it first arrived it had a manufacturers fault and so needed a replacement performance tip (it contained no holes in order for it to connect). The seller was very prompt in whizzing over the needed part to us very soon after receiving our complaint. Everything was done and dusted within a couple of weeks. Happy Customer - thanks!"
11851,3687,5," This bey is gorgeous.Its mode changes work perfectly &they do what it says on the tin. :)Get this bey its very powerful and is in my top three beys.No bey is the best there's always going to be one which is better due to a really good Combination or blader.I suggest using a metal-facebolt to aid balance and weight.this bey is beautiful and is really the KING OF THE BEAST THIS IS A MUST BUY!!!!!!!"
11852,3688,4," well made& as described& well packaged with quick delivery."
11853,3689,4," Was a hit with my son. He's a bit young to peddle it& all the parts are nicely madeCons- Instructions are treated as 2 parts one for the tractor one for the scoop. If like me you leave the stickers till last you find you have to take off the scoop to put the tractors stickers on.- The rear mud guard has minimal clearance from the peddle this is defiantly a big flaw and painfully catches little ankles. I cut 4cms off both sides with a dremel and buffed down the edges"
11854,3690,5," Bought for my Son to play with at school break times& he loves them.  Apparently the children at school are playing with them so these are popular now. The Tornado type is much taller than the older flat Beyblades"
11855,3691,5," Great item.I do recomend it. My son loved it and goes with it everywere.The chamber keeps the beyblades.It is easy to assemble the beys."
11856,3691,5," I'm not sure I know much about Beyblades but my son was having trouble piecing some of them together. The fitting seemed tighter on some than others& apparently this is a good thing as it creates a strong fit for when they are spinning and crashing together. Frustrating for little hands though. My son is 9.5 years and I've noted that some Beyblade items have a 12+ rating? I'm wondering if at the age of 12 these toys would still be attractive? Anyway& this odd looking thing popped up in my searches and was a low price so it was added to the stocking list. It seems to do exactly what it says and my son was delighted he didn't have to hurt his hands or ask me to help. You basically pop all the components in the chamber and twist& out pops an assembled Beyblade. It also stores some Beyblades inside. Good invention!"
11857,3691,5," I bought this for my grandson for his birthday& his elder brother has one and he wants to join in with the other boys& I looked on line because I didn't have a clue about what I was buying"
11858,3691,5," Brilliant !!"
11859,3691,2," Way overpriced for this plastic chamber that doesn't do much other than open and close. But I guess that's brand names for you."
11860,3692,5," Bought this during the holidays& and it served its purpose. Of course& with the rampant swapping going on in school& it changed shape immediately once school re-opened.The metal bottom tip apparently helps with the spinning!!"
11861,3692,4," The bey blade is nice and my son liked it. The price was also very good. Worthy to have it."
11862,3692,5," very good the boy i brought this for loves it i would buy it again and send it to him"
11863,3692,5," well what can i say where my grandsons are concerned thay are the best toys ever. beyblades thanks a lot"
11864,3693,4," Great game& fun  way of learning balance etc& only gripe I have is.. although all the pieces in the box were present& there are not enough bamboo columns to hold every single platform& you are always left with 3 left over!!!"
11865,3694,5," My 2 and 5 year old children love this& i also bought the number magnatab and they love them. it is sturdy& fun& and educational."
11866,3695,5," My children love it :-)"
11867,3696,5," Absolutely cute and worth the price! Our little girl loves it!!!Easy to build and it looks solid. It would be great if you could change the volume as it is rather loud.I would buy it again and rate it with five stars!"
11868,3696,5," We were delighted with the rocking horse as was our grandson. A wonderful gift. All as described and fast delivery. Would recommend this item."
11869,3696,5," fabulous...well made sturdy and a lovely gift."
11870,3696,4," My Granddaughter loves it"
11871,3696,4," Good value for money& toddler loves"
11872,3697,4," My 7 month old loves this as does his 3 year old brother!!  Great to have a toy that isn't plastic or battery powered and the humming noise gets the wee one's attention.  Great gift."
11873,3697,4," I have to buy this every so often as I love playing with it with my daughter& but I don't think it's really designed for use by an adult. After a while the gears (or whatever is inside them) starts to slip and they break. I love these though& showing the gyro affect as you hold it by the knob& or putting plastic dolls cups on the knob and watching them spin round. Baby Jennifer loves it and the humming noise too.A brilliant old school traditional toy. Don't expect it to last long if an adult uses it all the time!"
11874,3697,2," The top is supposed to have | humming| effect to it when spinning. It just about |hums| a bit when an adult manages to spin it hard enough. The one I had delivered is not for a kid to get any joy or fun out from it."
11875,3697,5," my little boy loves this&  it is so pretty and makes a lovely noise.  it takes me back to my own childhood as toys like this are few and far between now a days"
11876,3697,5," old fashioned and greatly appreciated by parents and children alike. This together with a kaleiderscope were hits of Christmas. The old things still please."
11877,3697,5," excellent present for my grandson to keep and pass onto his children colourful and a traditional toy can't fault from buying to receiving"
11878,3697,1," Brought for my Grandsons second birthday and the internal workings broke within two days& no excessive force used very disappointed"
11879,3697,5," the top is very bright and i am sure that my two gran-sons will be delighted with them on christmas day"
11880,3698,5," My 2yr old daugher is totally addicted to Toy Story. We actually had a Buzz and Woody from 1997 when our older children were small& so we hunted them out when she started her addiction to these films. It was her 2nd birthday last week and we wanted to get her something of her own and ordered her this Jessie. Its a bit smaller than the orginal toys but compliments them& it would not be as sturdy as the older ones which have obviously stood the test of time& however she has carried it around with her every day since her birthday and it is still in pretty good shape. Jessie only has a few sayings so it does get repetitive. Initially I thought it was a bit expensive for what it is& however when i see how much my daughter loves it& it was well worth the money. The only thing that really disappointed her about this toy is that it does not have the Name  ANDY on the sole of the boot& as it does in the film and as the other older toys have. But that is a small detail. All in all& a good buy& worth the money for a child who is very into Toy Story. My daughter simply loves it."
11881,3698,5," Perfect size for little hands and bang up-to-date with the latest Toy Story 3 film.  Kept the little one happy for hours.  Highly recommended."
11882,3698,5," well worth the price paid. both my sons enjoy playing with her. very durable. has even survived being dunked in the bath"
11883,3698,5," the talking jessie from toy story 3 my intl my grandaughter is over the moon with this toy& it takes a lot of punishment. and is good value for the money"
11884,3698,5," Purchased for my daughter for Christmas& she loves Jessie and the fact she has |real| hair. Her phrases are great and just like the movies."
11885,3698,5," I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. Daisy is 3 years old and adores Jessica- as she calls her. This& her mummy says. is her favourite of all her many presents and she carries her everywhere. I would highly recommend this doll and the company we purchased her from. No complaints. I am unable to comment on the durability as I haven't physically seen the doll-daughter lives in Ireland- and we have only just bought it hence 4 stars ...... but if it is as good as Woody who we purchased many years ago then I would suspect there will be no problems.  Woody was my now 16 year old sons fav toy and has been passed on to my granddaughter - string got broken through misuse at some point but otherwise in great 'well loved' condition :) got a lil faded through sitting on our window sill .... but hey :) again no complaints at all and both worth the money. Great lil characters and great fun."
11886,3698,5," I bought this talking Jessie for my daughter& and she was an instant hit.  I also bought her for a fantastic price& so really feel I received value for money.  Now need to buy Woody to go with Jessie& as I know my daughter will love him as much as Jessie!"
11887,3698,5," I ordered Jessie on a saturday and she arrived on the following monday&FANTASTIC SERVICE! Jessie is a true likeness of the Toy Story films&so when she arrived I was just as excited as my daughter who absolutely LOVES HER.It was worth getting the pull string Jessie which again sounds just like the film version&just be careful not to pull too hard as it only has a short pull string& which could break quite easily.Her face is perfect&she has soft woollen hair and a large rubber cowgirl hat. Jessie's clothes are made ok and we COULDN'T HELP but WRITE my daughter's name on her boot(just like Andy)!My only CONCERN is the NECK&which appears quite WOBBLY and doesnt seem to sit too deeply into the body. Still a brilliant toy&can't wait to get the rest of the gang :]"
11888,3699,5," After repeatedly being forced by my 2 year old to sit through hours of youtube video's watching some stranger open up surprise eggs& we decided it would be better for all parties involved if we brought our daughter her own stacking eggs to hide 'surprises' in.  They're brilliant....no more surprise egg videos for us! Would definitely recommend."
11889,3699,5," My son (16 months) had some Christmas nesting eggs this year and loved them. They were aged 3+ and a few of the pieces were very small& so he couldn't play with them unless I was fully watching him. When they went away with the decorations& he kept looking up at the shelf where they were kept with a sad face& so I set about finding some age appropriate nesting eggs.  We already have the Tomy squeaking eggs (non nesting of course) and my husband was worried these wouldn't offer much different& but I ordered them anyway!  SOOOOOOOOOOO pleased I did& although these don't look as fun as the Christmas ones (from Paperchase incidentally& have different characters on them!) he is over the moon with these nesting eggs. Loves taking them apart and with a little help& putting them back together.  I would say this is the next stage on in dexterity and development terms from stacking cups.  Great toy and great for hand/eye coordination development. At Â£5 incl P"
11890,3699,4," Good co - ordination toy which helps motor skills from quite a young age. Also good for young children that like to fiddle. Bright colours. The product is what it says it is and is inexpensive."
11891,3699,5," Love these nesting eggs.They have been played with over and over again by my nieces and nephews and are the first toy they want when they arrive at my home.They have also helped educationally with teaching both colour"
11892,3699,4," I bought these as a stocking filler for my toddler daughter (15 months) but wondered if she'd find them a bit basic. I needn't have worried. They have been played with daily since Christmas and she still finds it a but if a challenge opening them and putting them together and working out which one goes inside the other. Very good for motor development and good quality. You could even put a little surprise in the smallest egg or use them at Easter to hide chocolates / treats in. Very happy with my purchase!"
11893,3699,5," I chose these for my niece because I remember having a similar thing when my own son was young. He always gota lot of fun from it and though it is a very basic toy the colours teach colour coordination and the fitting of the eggs into one another teach them to fit things together and help with their judgement of sizes all whilst having fun. These eggs are well made and nice colours."
11894,3699,5," My son loves these&great for little hands.Very durable.easy to pull apart. Great for little ones who like exploring .would reccomend"
11895,3699,5," Delighted when I found this online.My grandkids have had hours of fun and lots of learning experiences from this simple toy.Less is more! No batteries& no noise& just simple hands-on finding out& and satisfaction from the end result."
11896,3700,5," very well made and colourful  well worth the  price"
11897,3701,5," Awesome! Came within less than a week! This can wreck tornados but is weak when played on normal stadium."
11898,3701,5," Not as long as I thought  is would take plus it an amazing toy way better than hasbro"
11899,3701,4," Good condition"
11900,3701,5," A"
11901,3702,5," This is not a toy& but a useful extension for Rody inflatable horse.  It turns it into a rocker& rather than a |hopper| toy. Searched high and low for this item for some time. Could only find& at one time& in USA& and the firms there were unable to ship to UK. Delighted at last& to find one through Amazon& though shipped from Germany. (Made in Italy& I believe). All it is& is a thick plastic base& curved slightly to enable rocking motion. The deflated legs of the toy are inserted into holes in the base& and the toy re-inflated. Makes a great rocker& and children love it. Not too expensive& and fast delivery. Recommended if you want a rocker for your existing Rody. My grandchildren love it. This item should to be more easily available to buy with the Rody."
11902,3702,5," I got this rody horse and rocker base for daughters first birthday& she loves it. maybe a bit young at the moment but she will get plenty of use in the future."
11903,3702,5," We've now got a rocking Rody& as well as the hopping Rody for the same price as a standard rocking animal. My daughter is 7 months old and I can see us getting lots of enjoyment from this extension to the hopper"
11904,3702,5," Great addition to the rody. My son loves using this toy as a rocker and I think it's a little more stable and safe than rody on its own. Quick delivery too!"
11905,3703,5," this will provide basic shape and colour recognition and hand-eye co-ordination. Perfect to help develop fine motor skills"
11906,3703,5," great gift for my little grandson"
11907,3704,5," great xmas gift for little ones"
11908,3705,5," AMAZING each and every toy they have are super and just so well built. Only thing is i wish all of there stock was in our UK Stores as they are with Target."
11909,3705,2," Great textures to the small balls but difficult for small hands to put in or get out. Overall weight too heavy for child to roll successfully or indeed pick up."
11910,3705,5," My baby loves chewing the different 'balls' bpa free and recycled materials! Love it!"
11911,3705,5," Youngest Grandson loves playing with it"
11912,3706,5," My friends child loves it although we waited a ridiculous time for it and it even was well past his birthday so I felt awful& emailed you twice  and you hadn't mentioned it was out of stock till the second email also you said you would provide a free gift never happened !"
11913,3707,4," Bought for grandaughter who loves it and will be great for development for several years."
11914,3708,5," All children should know about Noahs Ark  and this  is a really good way to introduce them to it  The toy is beautifully made  and easy for little hands to handle. I will be buying more."
11915,3708,5," I was really pleased with this - good colours& simple shapes with matching holes to post them into. I purchased as a christening present and it was very well received"
11916,3708,5," Great toy"
11917,3708,5," My Daughter loves this toy.  It is well made& solid and my 1 1/2 year old adores it.  What more of a recommendation do you need?"
11918,3708,5," For a 2 year old who loves animals.  The story of Noah's ark is always popular& so this 'ark' is giving a lot of pleasure."
11919,3708,5," Lovely solid&well painted and constructed toy&I bought this as a Christening present& not overly religious& just right I thought :-)"
11920,3708,5," Colourful and well made toy which I am sure will prove to be a much loved Christmas present for our grandson.It is sturdy and a much better choice than some of the plastic Noahs Arks available.Think this item is good value for money."
11921,3708,5," A birthday present that will be enjoyed by both sisters! Great for retelling the familiar story."
11922,3709,4," We have not fully |explored| the use of this product because it is a Christmas present but I tested it and it seems quite funny and entertaining. They seem quite sturdy (made of hard plastic). The green one is quite difficult to find. Handy that can also be used as alarma clock. Price is competitive. The service was great too: ordered Monday night delivered Wednesday! It is quite a small toy but I like it like that!"
11923,3709,3," My 2 year old at first loved this toy& but the novelty soon wore off as it doesn't actually do that much"
11924,3709,4," I bought two of these for my granddaughters 7th birthday& a cat and a rabbit& they make very good alarm clocks and are good fun to play with"
11925,3709,4," 4 stars. Why. Deliver was very fast& the Pet is great...but no batteries or better the batteries are there but with the need to be changed!! So with or without is exactly the same thing..."
11926,3709,5," Bought for my 5 year old for her birthday but actually it's her 22 month old little brother who likes playing with it more so think father Christmas will be getting him one too!"
11927,3709,4," We got 2 of them& it's funnier as they talk to each other& children have fun with them and learn to care about some |one|. They also work as alarm clocks"
11928,3709,5," Bought as present for my niece& she loved it and had lots of fun playing with it& that was until the new Furby came along."
11929,3709,5," This was for my great grandaughter and has become a real favourite.  Appealing and friendly face on the toy. Thank you"
11930,3710,5," My two boys are going through beyblade phase AGAIN and this worked well and they are enjoying playing/battling with it!"
11931,3710,5," My 7 year old had specifically requested this beyblade.  On Christmas morning it was a big hit especially as Santa had bought the Tornado Pegasus as well."
11932,3710,5," Another excellent beyblade - does what it's meant to - my son loves it.  Arrived promptly and for a reasonable price too - what more can you ask for."
11933,3711,5," Got this toy for Christmas and love it! Took about an hour to make but amazed at how well it worked. You can re-use the magnesium strips a few times but you get spares anyway. My cell was still generating power after 4 hours (although by this time was was very very slow) a great gift for anyone who wants something to keep them busy"
11934,3711,4," quick delivery& good quality product"
11935,3712,5," These cups are fab! Jasper loves it when I stack them up and then let him knock them down. He also loves taking them in the bath! He fills them with water then pours the water over his face! The cups will be fab as he grows up and can be used to teach him numbers& colours and volumes!"
11936,3712,5," luv it very eco.. i want to buy items more eco friendly and you wouldnt know they were recycled& the only issue is the distance they travel from america& ill b research more  but brilliant my the eco friendly who wants to stay out of the big cheap businesses"
11937,3712,5," Great stacking cups my children have fun playing with in the tub. They love serving coffee and I love that I don't have to worry about BPA& phthalates or any other kinds of scary substances that shouldn't be in children's toys."
11938,3712,5," Baby loves these"
11939,3713,5," Very solid bowls& nice solid colours too. I wanted these to support colour matching/sorting games and was very pleased with what I ordered. Have since discovered them cheaper elsewhere but maybe the quality isn't as good."
11940,3713,5," When I first got these& I thought I'd probably made a mistake as they didn't look particularly interesting& but my granddaughter always gets them out of the toybox!  This summer& no dip in the paddling pool was complete without these being thrown in as well and used to pour water.  Plus they're good picnic plates too!"
11941,3713,4," Delivered very promptly and I liked the fact that they were in 6 colours(not just the standard red yellow blue and green )  Match the rubbery pets I ordered for sorting and counting exactly"
11942,3713,4," The sorting bowls are bright and colourful and they have already caught the eye of my young grandson. They are a good size for young children to use."
11943,3713,5," Great resource for children to sort items- also used for grouping items. Great size and quality. Very well used resource."
11944,3713,5," These are great bowls.  I bought these for my childminded children for sorting and colour matching as they match the colours  of some other resources that I have exactly& namely some teddies and some farm animals.  The children love playing with the bowls and they have really helped with colour recognition which was part of our theme last month."
11945,3713,5," I bought these to go with the sorting bears and tongs. - run a child care setting for pre school children and each child has used these lovely resources in diffrtent ways& it covers all the EYFS and PLODS and COEL."
11946,3713,5," A simple& yet brilliant addition to the sorting resources& makes it all so much easier for the children& and while they're  happy playing& they're also learning."
11947,3714,2," Although I know it is not expensive& it should still do the job it is designed for. Since it tends to make the gimbals follow the gyro& it fails to maintain rigidity and topples before it has run down. Even as a toy it is therefore disappointing. When I was a young man I had a brilliant gyro and my family was not rich."
11948,3714,5," I boight this for my nephew who is in his fifties and is one of his favourite memories from childhood.  Still as great as it was when we were children. Great price and well made."
11949,3714,5," Weird lil thing."
11950,3714,5," GREAT. OH YES."
11951,3714,5," Good toy"
11952,3715,5," This is a nice toy. It does not keep a 1-year old occupied for a long time& but they appear to go back to it frequently& especially& if one has shown them how to use it and if one& once in an while& spins it oneself. I cannot yet comment on durability& which is why I gave it 4 stars."
11953,3716,5," I had ordered this product from amazon but have just cancelled it having seen and bought the exact same item& identical colours/patterns etc for Â£3.99 from B"
11954,3716,5," i bought this train for my nephew but my niece of 3 years old hasnt let him play WITH IT YET& AS SHE LOVES IT!!!its beautiful colours and removable blocks are fun to play with."
11955,3716,5," My 18 month old son loves this train set. It's very sturdy and built for little boys who like to bash/throw their toys! Excellent! The colourful blocks to place on the trains keep him busy (and quiet!) for hours. Love this!"
11956,3716,5," It's just great! It's simple and easy to play with. Beautiful color blocks. My 15 months old daughter loves it."
11957,3716,4," This is a really great little wooden toy. All the bits come part and are brightly painted and nicely finished. My god son (just turned one) instantly played with it& pulling it around and taking the pieces off and putting them back on. It's a nice change from all the plastic rubbish that people buy these days.The item arrived promptly as well& the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the packaging really let it down. It makes the item look cheap as though it comes from a discount store. Which is a shame if you giving it as a present. Also my box was slightly damaged when it arrived in the post. If you are buying it for your own child I would highly recommend this. If giving as a present& you may have to wrap it a bit better."
11958,3716,5," Very quick delivery. The item is super cute with it being brightly coloured. I have bought this for my nephews first birthday and I'm certain him and his parents will love it (they love train themes for babies). With it being small-ish I think it'll make a great keep sake present too& perhaps even a hand-me-down. Overall it's a lovely item and would reccomend to buy!!"
11959,3716,3," Bought for my nephew for Christmas after he enjoyed playing with my son's similar train. I was disappointed though with how small it is. My son's was more expensive and larger so I guess this is reflected in the lesser price. Still& its a nice present for my 18 month old nephew."
11960,3716,5," This is a great toy ...too bad I didn't read the description well as some of the pieces are quite small for a 1y old. (pack says 3y +)So it will have to wait until she grows a bit ..."
11961,3717,5," My 6 month old really loves this toy and it is his favourite rattle.  The bell keeps him interested& it rolls round on the play mat and it's great for tiny hands to grasp.  Some of the bigger toys are a bit heavy for little arms& but he manages this toy with ease.  He's now passing it from hand to hand and bashing it about.  So far& it has survived his bashing very well and he's shown no sign of losing interest. The grandparents love it too as it's wooden.The bell has quite a jingle and we now keep it for daytime use as he was bashing it in his cot at all hours."
11962,3717,5," We bought this for our almost 4 month old and it was an instant hit. She is able to hold onto it nicely and seems to enjoy the bell jingling away. The bright colours appeal to her and so she is happy to look at it for ages. I am not a big fan of all the plastic& battery-operated tat that is marketed for babies and so think that this back-to-basics toy is brilliant."
11963,3717,5," My 5 month old loves to grab and shake this and it is very durable."
11964,3717,5," I bought this for my then 6 month old son as he loved the ones at play group. he's now 16 months old and still loves it. The paint has stayed on and the wood has stayed in perfect condition. They can be a bit pricey but well worth it."
11965,3718,5," Good quality arrived quicker than expected"
11966,3719,5," What a lovely toy! You get six little hexagonal pots with six colour matched bees& and a pair of wooden tweezers.The hexagonal hive pieces are all separate so you can play at fitting them together in different shapes and layouts. The tweezers help work on those dexterity& co-ordination and concentration skills - you can stack the pots vertically and practice placing/removing the bees from a sideways angle& or lay them out on a surface and do it vertically. There are lots of little colour-matching games you can make up with this toy& plus we like to turn them over and play |find the bee| or some simple memory games.My only thought for improving this game would to be to add a seventh pot and bee to complete the colours of the rainbow and add another educational aspect& and perhaps a simple bag for storage and travel."
11967,3719,5," Bought this as a leaving gift for my children's (Beehive!) nursery. They loved the quality of the product and the children liked the colourful pieces. Their comment was that it was good for individual play for the children and was great for practising their motor skills. Overall I was really pleased with this purchase."
11968,3719,5," This was a gift for my Grandsons bought on behalf of someone else and we were all delighted with this toy. Beautifully made and very attractive to the little ones excellent value"
11969,3719,5," My 2&5 yo daughter likes little bees and their homes very much. I placed all parts on the wooden tray for better concentration."
11970,3719,5," Love these bees! Great for little ones. Suitable for younger than recommended age."
11971,3719,3," Nice product but poor craftsmanship. Paint not great and box scratched."
11972,3719,5," The delivery man had lobbed the package over the fence but thankfully amazon packing is so good the box& and everything inside& remained intact! The product comes in a nice compact box& which will be fine to store it in in the toy box.I opened it up to have a look today and the product is a nice size& perfect for little hands. I used the pincers myself"
11973,3720,4," Not. As study as I thought lasted 2 hoursGood gift for a boy"
11974,3721,4," Lovely gift/stocking filler. Very much smaller than was expecting (very small items)"
11975,3721,5," These are delightful little tops. They spin for ages and are very well balanced& so stay in pretty much the same place rather than skittering all over the floor. They are well made from solid wood and painted in a variety of bright primary colours likely to appeal to children and adults alike& with patterns in contrasting paint. The patterns look particularly attractive as they spin.As indicated in the details for this product the tops are very small& which makes them perfect for little fingers& party bags and crackers.Outstanding value and arrived promptly& so nothing at all to complain about!"
11976,3721,5," At the price I half expected only one spinning top to be delivered& but all 6 turned up in the expected date range and they are beautiful little toys. They are nicely balanced& all six spin well and the painting is nicely done& not perfectly even& with attractive colours. I would happily recommend these to others."
11977,3721,5," Very good quality. Much impressed with them. Also as they come in a pack of six you can enjoy with the whole family."
11978,3721,5," Great collection of spinning tops.  Would be idea for party bags or the like.  Or in my case xmas fillers."
11979,3722,5," My little boy loved this and I love it's sturdy design. It's well made and quite a cool design although I bought it at the reduced price and don't think I would pay the full price which the other colours were at the time."
11980,3723,5," I love it and so does my daughter& perfect size. Also like the centre pole as it is quite fat and rounded at the top."
11981,3724,5," Excellent delivery.  My son and daughter are obsessed with these cups and play with them constantly"
11982,3724,5," Good quality arrived quicker than expected"
11983,3725,3," Rattlebones is a fun game that takes a lot of well known mechanics and mixes them up to make something quite unique.It's essentially a Roll"
11984,3725,5," Simple elegant dice rolling game that has a sneaky amount of tactics. You choose one of your three dice to roll and move one of your three pieces& when it lands on a space you get to decide if you want to put that dice part onto that die. If you roll an action you take it. Very simple game but the building your custom dice doesn't seen tactical it actually is. Very fun quick easy game!"
11985,3726,5," My grandson loved these kind regards carol"
11986,3727,5," I had searched the shops to find an |old fasioned spinning top| as& even at my great age& I remember how I enjoyed mine as a young child.  I was unable to track one down& other than their modern equivalents& in the shops so searched online and was extremely pleased to find this one.  My grand daughter loves it and I am so pleased to have found it."
11987,3727,5," A friend bought this spinning top for my daughters 1st birthday and out of all the other toys she was given it was the one she used most& she is now two and still gets it out and enjoys playing with it.  I have now bought this for another friends daughter's 1st birthday as Im sure she will get as much enjoyment out of it as my daughter did.It is well made& safe and sturdy."
11988,3727,5," I bought this for a friends sons b'day.  it is good quality and has a nice traditional pattern.  I think it could be used for a few years from 1 upward.  Good price for a nice toy."
11989,3727,1," Have to really make it spin fast for humming to work and on doing so it doesn't spin at all now as it only lasted a few daysNo good at all and would not recomend it"
11990,3727,5," The traditional humming top has to be in every child's toy box.  Our grandson has had great fun with it since Christmas."
11991,3727,1," It came very quickly and well packed& I Bought it for my granddaughters first birthday& it's very flimsy and does not hum as described!"
11992,3727,5," This humming top is  great for  very small children&very bright and cheerful a real eyecatcher a good andall round toy to last for many years to comeand real value for money."
11993,3727,1," Bought this Humming Top for my daughters first birthday in the middle of June.  Three weeks later it is broken (internally).  My children are not disrespectful with their toys& and it has not been misused.  The failed parts are inside the humming top& which cannot be accessed& fiddled with or repaired.  It did not receive excessive use.  Very disappointed& am unable to contact seller via my order history.  Beautifully decorated& and whilst it worked it was enjoyed.  Wont be investing in a replacement."
11994,3728,5," I bought this for my daughters birthday& she loves wooden toys. I didn't expect this to be soo big which is a nice plus. its very strong and durable. She loved it soo much& so did my youngest who is 3.Because its a hardwearing toy i decided to buy my little one a bird as well& so far she hasn't broken it and this kid can break anything...i would definatly tell people to buy this product get wodden toys back in the world..Its well worth the money plus its nice to have wooden toys around again..."
11995,3728,5," I bought thios as a present for someone and its just perfect. You just wind it up& using the key on the bottom and the bird moves and sings. So real& so cute and just perfection. As mentioned before& its windup so you don't even need to keep buying batteries to keep it going. highly reccomended I tell you very Tweet lol."
11996,3728,5," Not really for small children& but quite well made for the price. Quite entertaining& nice tweety sound& keeps our parrot happy."
11997,3728,4," ACTUALLY BOUGHT THIS FOR MY CAT AS SHE LOVES SINGING BIRDS ON YouTube. She loves it. Makes a great gift!!!"
11998,3728,5," I bought one of these for my Grandmother as a nostalgic gift as I remember her having an old metal one when I was a kid that was her mothers.I have to say it is very adorable. The bird inside is a little tacky looking& and I definitely wouldn't recommended for an excitable child& as the wood& although it isn't at all flimsy& is very delicate.The product is smaller than I imagined& but I'm very pleased with it anyway."
11999,3728,5," I bought this item as a birthday present for my Mam. She was absolutely thrilled with it& she said it reminded her of a similar ornament one of her aunts had had when she was a child. Really fast delivery and works a treat and cheaper than the same item in Hawkins Bazzaar."
12000,3728,1," Very cheap looking& didn't think it looked like wood at all. Flimsy and the wind up mechanism was broken within a couple of hours. Only suitable for older children. I followed reviews before I bought this item& now wishing I hadn't."
12001,3728,5," I bought this for my 21 year old daughter and she loved it (so did I). Some time has passed and I still get pleasure winding it up to hear its chirpy song. A very lovely gift for all !"
12002,3729,5," Bought as a present& this was delivered as described in new condition and on time. The monkeys pop together and apart easily and haven't broken yet. They are a light plastic material and the printing isn't wearing away yet. Very happy with the slightly different faces they pull& and being able to fill the final tiny money with a message for them!"
12003,3729,5," great for the kids&smallest one is quite small so watch very young childrenall in all great learning toy for boys and girls"
12004,3729,5," My nephew loves them and he plays with them all the time. Be ware of the smallest monkey it can be easily sollowed"
12005,3730,5," wonderful gift for my granddaughter& I have bought several Sylvanian item such great quality.I recommend the item for any little girls must have toy"
12006,3731,5," this beyblade is really good because its got billiant stamina because of its WD WIDE.DEFENCE preformace tip. If you need a little boost on your stamina then this is the bey for YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU."
12007,3732,4," Accurately made and balanced spinning tops bought as a stocking filler for myfive-year old daughter.The set comprises three different designs that require some dexterity to get themspinning properly (and if you get it right& they really do spin well). My daughterhasn't quite mastered the twist-flick technique so finds them a little frustrating.She does& however& enjoy watching them whizz around and I'm sure she'll be ableto spin them herself with practise.Good value for money."
12008,3732,5," This is possibly the cheapest thing we have bought him but he plays with these constantly. They appear hand painted and are lovely quality. Our boy particularly loves the blue one as when it spins the pattern is very appealing. He has chewed them& thrown them and still they spin wonderfully. Easy to take with you anywhere (our boy had an op on Monday and we were spinning these on the hospital floor to keep him amused and relaxed and he even had one in recovery so he could find comfort with his small toy). Def recommend - they are fab : 0)"
12009,3732,5," Very durable spinning tops.Kids loved them..........even the older ones. Competition as to who can spin theirs the longest. Great stocking fillers."
12010,3732,3," These tops served their purpose in a school context& the children enjoyed playing with them and they were sturdy too."
12011,3732,5," I bought these when I was looking for games for my Playground Olympics party. I didn't plan to use them for that but thought they looked cute and might be useful for my grandsons to play with. They did entertain my 4 year old grandson for a while but I think they are better used as an executive toy as spinning them can be addictive and relaxing and they would look good on a desk."
12012,3732,4," I bought these to help my Grandson learn the tequnique of holding a pencil with fingers& a teacher I know uses these and tweezers in order to get children excercising the 3 fingers needed for writing. We just make game of trying to keep 3 spinning together but I already see it is going to do the trick. Thanks to Mrs Madden!!"
12013,3732,5," Great toys& a bit small but totally usable. My little girl loves them."
12014,3732,5," Very impressed with these tiny tops. Made from wood with different painted designs.They spin for ages. Fun to have competitions to see which one can spin for the longest. Bought for primary school children to improve fine motor skills.Delivery was also very fast-thanks."
12015,3733,4," Must be good. I bought this for my nephew for Christmas. Its his 9th birthday shortly and he's asked for another one out of the same series."
12016,3734,5," Arrived quickly and well packaged in time for christmas. Searched around for sometime to find this particular piece. Will happily use again."
12017,3734,5," Fantastic figure& came very promptly in general post and would definitely buy another"
12018,3734,5," Great little mini-figures. Great service too. xx"
12019,3734,5," :-)"
12020,3735,5," I got this battle pack today. At first I had my doubts& but this is a very good battle pack. It includes a speeder& two bomb squad troopers that are suppost to have white on& but instead is kind of a peachy colour some cases I've seen are worse than others. Also this set includes the awesome ARF trooper which is amazing!!!. Plus an eeth koth trooper. If you didn't already know& Eeth Koth is a Jedi Master in the clone wars and the prequels as killed by chancellor Palpatine in episode 3. But he had his own squadron of clones but I don't know what their called.This set is worth the Â£[]BUT! one thing I dislike about LEGO is when new stuff comes out they scrap the old stuff. Like the old clone trooper battle pack which a little better than this. They charge you Â£[] for them now so if you want a plain white clone you have to buy an expensive set. Or bid on ebay which is really unfair. So I think LEGO should re stock the old 2008 Battle pack and keep the new one so you can have an army of both. So that it makes better battle scenes or bases. Please like this comment if you agree they should Also re stock the old 2008 clone trooper battle pack and combine them together aswell"
12021,3735,4," The new Clone Trooper battle pack is a fab addition to my little boys' Lego collection. It contains 4 Trooper minifigs& (an ARF Trooper& Clone Trooper and 2 Bomb Squad Troopers)& which are all nicely detailed& (even having printing on some of their legs& which I'm told is great!)& and quite different from any other minifigures that we already had. Also included is a BARC speeder& which fits one minifigure on it. This is a great looking& detailed speeder and was fun for the boys to build.I think that this set is relatively reasonably priced. It's not a big set by any means& but you do get enough figures to get a battle up and running& and it's at a price that kids could well be able to save up pocket money etc for. We've had a lot of play value from this. Recommended."
12022,3735,5," Lego have produced Clone Battle Packs before& and this new one has the expected 4 clone troopers with a vehicle. This time& the clones are very different as there is a ARF Trooper& two bomb squad Clones and a commander Clone& but with green flashes on his uniform. The BARC speeder holds one clone and is able to zoom around the battlefield.My six year old is a competent Lego builder and he built this in a reasonable time. It was a little tricky to put some of the BARC parts together& and so reinforcements were bought in to help a couple of times (namely Grandad!). Still& the vehicle holds together well and was deployed on to the front lines. I guess I would rate this a moderately difficult build& because of the couple of tricky bits towards the end.The new clones have been involved in all sorts of skirmishes since he bought this toy& and so I would say it is a big hit with us and a great addition to the Clone Armies and their ongoing war effort against the Seperatists!"
12023,3735,5," Battle packs are great for building up your Clone army"
12024,3735,3," There is absolutely nothing wrong with this lego set except that the cost is ridiculous for an item which is so small and originally cost about a third of the price.  It is clearly a collectors set and should really state that somewhere. I am a grandmother and have no knowledge whatsoever about Star Wars ( I think I need to educate myself). I purchased this for my grandson who is only 6 years old and he would not know it was a collectors set. The company who sold and dispatched it were extremely efficient. It arrived promptly and was exactly as stated. I had no problem obtaining a refund. The reason I am giving only a 3 star rating is because I do think somewhere Amazon should state that sets which are no longer current may cost more than their original price& which is fine if you are a collector and you know what you are purchasing. I had  also purchased another set which was also a collectors set but as it was not so expensive I decided to keep it as I'd paid postage on it and would have had to pay to return it. It worked out better just to cut my losses and keep it.  Look out - always check on the official lego site before purchasing lego. If it is a redundant item on that site be aware you may be paying over the odds for a collectors item without realising."
12025,3736,5," My son loves this toy! I bought it as 'in-flight entertainment' for our holiday and it entertained him for hours. The lights and sound are very effective& both visual and audible& considering the engine's overall size.I definitely recommend this toy and will be buying a few more as presents!PS: The fireman can also hold onto the ladder on the back whilst the whole fire engine speeds around. This was also a source of endless fun!"
12026,3736,5," Perfect for a Christmas addition. We also bought the ambulance which has a different siren. They are great and work perfectly with the wooden road set and garage."
12027,3736,5," A Lovely little train. Well made and good quality& as you'd expect from Brio.My 3 year old loved it."
12028,3736,5," Lights& noise& little action figure that can attach to the ladder and use the hose in his hand& magnetic links. All the things my son loves. Will be buying more of the brio range."
12029,3736,4," For my grandsons 2nd birthday& he was really surprised that it made a noise and lit up he played with it for ages& much to his parents delight& lucky me could walk away."
12030,3736,5," Yet another great product to add to the Brio train set.  I would recommend this train set and accessories for all young children& they play for hours with it."
12031,3736,5," My Grandson was absolutely thrilled with his birthday present.  As he is Brio train and fire engine mad it made a wonderful gift"
12032,3736,5," Grand daughter loves it and it has become a good addition to her other pieces. Plays with it outside of the biro track as well."
12033,3737,4," My first 2014 (LEGO) â€œStar Warsâ€ set!! And Iâ€™m pretty excited! I had seen the video review of this set a few days back and liked it. Then & I decided to take it. Today I saw it in a local store and bought it immediately (though there were a LOT of other new LEGO sets).  And This set is MUCH better than I thought I would be and Iâ€™m pretty Happy!The BEST part about this set is of course the Minifigs. Iâ€™m NOT much of a â€œStar Warsâ€ fanâ€¦but Iâ€™m a HUGE LEGO fanâ€¦mostly because of minifigs! And THATâ€™s the reason I took this set. Beaufitul minifigs! This set contains 4 Utapau  troopers. Two are the Para-troopers ( both exactly the same ) and the other two are the 212th clone-troopers (both&  also& exactly the same)  The printings on their Torsos and legs are VERY good. (Generally& LEGO doesnâ€™t do much printing on the legs on the minifig but here itâ€™s done it& so good). Their helmets are MAGNIFICIENT! Two different kinds of helmets in this set! And each is FANTASTIC. Good markings and design on both the helmets. (One minor complaint I have about LEGO is that they NEVER do side printing on torsos of the minifigs and I feel it looks weird. Hope someday LEGO will start doing it).One VERY GOOD thing about this set are the NEW blasters from LEGO..This year & itâ€™s the first time LEGO has introduced such blasters! This is my FIRST set where Iâ€™m seeing these blasters. And guess what? THEY REALLY FIRE! YES! Thereâ€™s a very simple and awesome mechanism in this blaster& where you can fire a stud. And it travels a pretty decent speed! Though itâ€™s a play feature for kids& adults are also going to equally enjoy it!! Just put a blaster in one minifig& put another one in front of it & shoot the blaster ..and BLAM! The other minifg is down. Just do it! Then youâ€™ll see why Iâ€™m ecstatic about it!Read more â€º"
12034,3737,5," I gave this a 5 star because it really is that good! For Â£12 you get so much& its not like last years battle pack where the set was no where near exciting. All the figures are exclusive& just by buying about 3  of this item you already have an army and you can never get bored with this set& especially as the guns included can actually fire!"
12035,3737,5," This set I thought was a good price at Â£16.49 for 4 figs and a vehicle The figs are great you get two 212th troopers and two airborne troops amazing!Great for u army builders!MUST BUY"
12036,3737,5," Beautifully packaged. Made now by grandson"
12037,3737,5," FANTASTIC. 10 year old boy loved this. took a good amount of time to build and admire and photograph etc etc. worth it!"
12038,3737,5," My son bought this with his birthday money and built it himself. He's very pleased with it."
12039,3737,5," Excellent arrived promptly and put a huge smile on my son's face!!"
12040,3737,5," Excellent my nephew loved it.Excellent on dispatch"
12041,3738,5," A self-confessed Lego-loving adult& I bought this set before the recent free Jack Sparrow minifig offer in the papers& largely because this minifig is so cute"
12042,3738,4," This Pirates of the caribbean lego was bought as a christmas present for my 5 year old who is pirate mad at the moment and he absolutely loves it!It is a fantastic toy for chldren who are into this sort of thing and includes the main charaters and lots of little accessories for them to use whilst playing.I would have to say although this includes a very clear instruction booklet in my opinion I don't really think that children under the age of 7-8 would be able to build this by themselves& as all the lego items I have bought for my son I have had to build for him.But having said this I don't mind doing it as once it's built he has hours of fun play with it& and it does state the age guidlines on the box are 8+& I personally don't see why younger children can't play with it as long as they're not prone to putting things in their mouths!!Overall this is a great toy and very reasonably priced& definitely well worth buying."
12043,3738,5," This was bought as a present for our 10 year old at Christmas and it went down extremely well with him.  One reason being that he is a great Lego fan plus he thought the picture on the box made the item look good fun.Well the set has been used along with the other sets from the same range (pirates).  You don't need to get all the other sets to have hours of fun& a this set has lots of parts that move and can be made into various combinations.The best bit was the money (lego money) according to our son& along with the island with the skeleton.Must say that no pieces have been broken yet or lost& and the other smaller pieces from the same range (some under five pound) have been combined with this Island set.I think the best thing with Lego is that you don't have to buy all the expensive parts to have fun& as even the less priced items are well made and give hours of fun for lego lovers whatever their ages."
12044,3738,4," I bought this because my 9 year-old wanted to play with the characters& the rest was a useful bonus. It is still being used and& despite some of the parts being small& we have managed not to lose anything yet. It's good to recreate some of the scenes from the films& or to make your own up. As it's so small& it's esy to build and store as well. We like it!"
12045,3738,5," Bought this for my son as he really loves lego and was going through a pirates of the carribean phase. The main thing he wanted was Captain Barbosa& so when i made this for him and he realised he also go the skeleton barbosa as well he was over the moon. The set itself was very easy to build& i would say that it was easy enough for my son to build& but all he did was build the figures then go play with thm whilst i built the rest of it! A lot of the gold coind have got lost (or vaccuumed up)& but i dont think that's an issue with the toy& more of an issue with a 5yr old child who doesn't put things away!So if you like Lego and you like Pirates& this set ticks both boxes and yo uwont be disapointed"
12046,3738,5," Present for a 8 year old - loves the game. Good price& good packaging and excellent delivery. One happy little boy who loves Lego and all things Pirates of the Caribbean."
12047,3738,5," My son bought this with his birthday money as he really likes Pirates of the Carribean& and is into lego big style.As soon as it came he had it made up and has played over and over again with it.Good value for money.CheersAW"
12048,3738,5," My son loves the Pirates movies and this is a great little toy from the 1st film.He makes it without any help and he is 8. So I would think it is ideal for 7-12 yr olds."
12049,3739,4," These now live stuck to the side of our fridge& where both toddler and cat make good use of them. On the down-side& the laminated color thingy comes off too easily."
12050,3740,5," My almost 6 year old son wanted this toy for Christmas.He played with it a lot at pre-school where they have a 400 piece pack& for all children to share.As I found the 600 piece price reasonable& I ordered it and it arrived very quickly in perfect condition.My son is playing with this toy for a long time every day& and does not seem to get bored with it.It has enough pieces so that you can make very large constructions& such as castles etc& so it is unlikely that you'll need to buy more pieces anytime soon.It also inludes many wheels and axles& four train connectors and some pieces with drawings on them& such as eyes (to make animals) and train lights& and instructions to make some nice things& but the options for constructing things is only limited by one's imagination!They also seem to be of a very high quality and it is a toy that can take lots of abuse.I highly recommend this toy& a definite 5 star!"
12051,3741,5," Being a huge fan of Professor Snape I couldn't resist buying this particular Lego set& and I wasn't disappointed. It takes about 30 minutes to construct as the 25 page instruction manual is easy to follow with lovely& clear diagrams. It comes with 3 different characters& Snape himself& Ron Weasley and one other that I took to be a ghost. The attention to detail is particularly good. Professor Snape comes with a cloak& in the dungeon there is a spiders web complete with spider& a boiling cauldron& Ron's rat Scabbers& potions bottles and a cupboard behind which the ghost is concealed. All in all I think this product provides excellent value for money and is great fun."
12052,3741,3," I think this item really feels like smapes class dark and scary with a hidden ghost! this also is the bottom base for a larger building. the next item to get to put on top is the dueling club and then when youve got the chamber of secrets you put the entrance on top."
12053,3741,5," This Lego set is an excellent introduction to the Harry Potter Lego series. It is fun and easy to build and provides plenty for young imaginative minds to interact with and enjoy.If you can't quite afford the bigger sets then this will make a great gift - and if you already own the castle then this set compliments it brilliantly - highly recommended!"
12054,3741,5," This toy is great you can make magical snacks and mystical drinks that taste great and the really cool self stirring is fun to watch this is the coolest toy ive ever seen!"
12055,3742,5," Lego continue their Clone Wars releases in 2009 with set 8036: Separatist Shuttle.The shuttle itself is a nice replica of a Haor Chall Engineering Sheathipede class transport shuttle and features an opening front hatch for the cockpit and fold-up landing legs. There is also a nice mechanism in the side that& with the turn of an axle& opens the rear doors and allows access to the inside where there is a sliding seat platform with room for one figure.The best thing about the kit is really the five figures that come with it. There are 2 standard B1 Battle Droids& both armed with black blaster rifles and an OOM series Pilot Droid to fly the ship.For the first time we also have the treacherous Nemoidian Nute Gunray and the Rodian ambassador Onaconda Farr. Both are great figures and a welcome addition to the Lego universe.The shuttle is 19.5 cm long& 9.5 cm wide (at the landing legs) and 17.5 cm tall.The kit comprises 234 pieces (not including figures and weapons)& there are 7 decals to apply and construction time is about 20 minutes.A nice little ship and worth it just for the figures."
12056,3742,5," I got this shuttle for a present for my hard work.I was a bit worried about some review about it being fragile in some places.These reviews were wrong because if you put it together properly it is not fragile at all.proswell put togetherminifiguresgood instuctionsconsneeds more minifigures.could have some clones or super battle droidshope this is helpfullJames smith age 11"
12057,3742,5," This was given as a gift. They had great fun putting it together and it has been involved in many battles so has provided hours on enjoyment. As always with lego you get what is on the box."
12058,3742,5," Great Lego to add to my Lego Star Wars collection& I loved the new charaters and shuttle& great value. Had lots of fun building it."
12059,3743,5," In terms of value for money with this set while you don't get much actual LEGO what you're getting a a Boba Fett Minifig& and not one& but two Han Solo's - that's got to be worth the asking price alone. I love the detail on the carbonite solo block and if I wasn't sure somebody would steal it I'd have it on display at work.The build is straightforward& though there are lots of smaller pieces with this set& but it won't take long to put together. Quality as ever is top notch - though the box has the new villain on it& now any classic Empire artwork.I would recommend this wholeheartedly& just don't waste it on your kids!"
12060,3743,5," This is a good kit. The build is fun and relatively quick.I built this on my own to enjoy one evening& then took it apart for my 5 year old son to rebuild on his own the next day.He is great at the step by step lego instructions& with the kits he gets and always really enjoys seeing and playing with what he has built.Little did he expect what this kit does! With a simple and effective pull and twist mechanism you can 'freeze' Han Solo in Carbonite!Echoes of Wow! Cool! and general excitement followed.Get this kit. It IS cool!"
12061,3743,5," This was a must have for me. Not yet sold in the US I did not want this to pass me by. Smaller than expected& but still captures the essence of the freezing chamber. Love the detail to capture the scene from Empire Strikes Back. I agree with some that it should come with Leia and some other minifigs& but for the price I can't complain. Great addition to my collection."
12062,3743,5," Bought as a present for my lego mad husband. He was very pleased with it and said it was a good build. Slightly smaller then I was expecting though."
12063,3743,5," Bought for my son and it's fantastic value.A great addition to his Lego Star Wars collection."
12064,3743,5," The set is good& good because it's got a lot of features and it's at a great price."
12065,3744,5," As you would expect the item is robust and goes well with the other police items my son has"
12066,3744,5," Item arrived promptly& it's a gift for my 7 yr old nephew and I'm sure he'll love it."
12067,3744,5," bought for our grandson Christmas present good price would recommend speedy delivery"
12068,3744,5," Nice extra for my nephews Christmas police tactical unit."
12069,3744,5," Fast delivery& great little chatacters amazing detail."
12070,3744,4," grandson loved it.  Postage again& was extortionate."
12071,3745,3," Slightly disappointed with this lite brix. I thought it would be a nice change from the big known brand of building bricks-it just didn't measure up. It was quite awkward to put together and to get it to stay together is impossible. It falls to bits every time my daughter plays with it. It is such a shame that the build quality is not there because the lights are actually amazing. I think it's back to collecting the other brand unfortunately."
12072,3745,5," Does Exactly what it said A+"
12073,3746,5," Excellent Item& very robust and worth every penny."
12074,3746,5," Bruder& I think the best toys for little boys."
12075,3746,4," Very sturdy"
12076,3747,5," This is a nice small building set which consists of 73 pieces.There are 3 mini figures:- Harry Potter with brown wand - 2 faced figure - Harry smiling and Harry frowning- Lucius Malfoy with black wand and cape - 2 faced- annoyed and death-eather- Dobby the house elfThere is also a broom& a spider& a couple of torches& Tom Riddle's Diary and a sock.The build becomes an archway from the Hogwarts corridor where Harry confronted Lucius Malfoy and conned him into giving Dobby clothes& and therefore his freedom.There is a lever at the back which can be pressed to make Lucius Malfoy fly away from Dobby and Harry when the spell is cast.It is an easy build when compared to some of the Lego sets& but then again it is a one of the smaller sets. The build itself only takes a short time - at most an hour if you take your time and have a number of interruptions.The cost is just over 14 pence per piece (at the RRP) which is a little more expensive than some kits& so if you can get it cheaper than the RRP it becomes better value for money.For you money you get the 3 mini figures which includes the first appearance of Dobby the house elf.The Dobby mini figure is excellent. It has a moulded head which is just like the one in the film& and it has proved to be an instant favourite in the house.This is a great Harry Potter kit which is easy enough for older children to build without the constant need for adult supervision.*** UPDATE ***This piece is now retired and will probably rise in value."
12077,3747,5," Bought for my grandson.  He loves it.  Good packaging."
12078,3748,5," He loved all the star wars lightsabers. Your a life saver as I didn't know anywhere else to purchase them without buying them in a huge Â£50 set with only 1 lightsaber :( way better than the Lego shops. Thankyou do much"
12079,3748,4," Bought as an extra gift at Christmas& Starwars Lego mad child. Packaging was nonexistent but now all his characters have lightsabers."
12080,3748,5," I like these lightsabers because the characters that I had could use them.I don't like these lightsabers because I had a lot of the light blue ones already."
12081,3748,5," My son absolutely loved these. They are overpriced for what they are but they really are brilliant - now all the little lego guys can join in the battle!"
12082,3748,5," I ordered these for part of my Son's table present.  They were expensive and small but he loved them and has spent all Christmas playing with them."
12083,3748,5," My son was very happy with the different colors of light sabers and thats what counts! All 15 arrived in a little plastic pocket."
12084,3748,5," My 5 year old son was delighted with this set. So easy to lose these light sabers so great to have all these as spares."
12085,3748,5," It came quite quickly and even with a free extra. Just what we wanted. Thank you. Recommend to all lego star wars fans."
12086,3749,5," When it comes to sci-fi movies arguably no spaceship has so well represented power and menace like the Imperial Star Destroyer. With its design it really does look the part. I know that Lego used to do a bigger model of this although I donâ€™t know if that is still being made. I do know that according to their site this particular micro model is being retired& so it looks like you need to get one where available& as there wonâ€™t be any more.Although obviously this is only a little model of the spaceship it does have that design and feel of the larger version& and has two flick effect missiles as well as an engine design on the rear. This has a little cockpit where you can house the Imperial Crew figure& which comes with this. The figure also has a hand blaster for one on one attacks.Children will enjoy this as they can easily hold it in their hands& and this can be used to menace Rebel Alliance playsets. As I mentioned above though& according to the Lego website this has been retired& so it is now definitely starting to become a collectorâ€™s item& so get one whilst you still can."

12089,3749,5," Very nice and bigger than expected. My son liked it a lot. The cheapest way to get a Star Destroyer"
12090,3749,4," Although not my favourite of this series& this is still a nice little kit with some clever construction and nice detail - as long as you don't mind the massive discrepancy in scale of ship and pilot. Definitely worth getting if you like the micro series."
12091,3749,2," I think this is my least favourite of the micro fighter series. The star destroyer is just a triangular wedge of Lego and the minifig is dull. If it was Â£5& I'll buy it& but at Â£7& it's a definite pass for me."
12092,3749,4," My grandchild really likes star wars. Great."
12093,3749,5," What a fun piece to build!"
12094,3750,5," Super arrived on time"
12095,3751,5," Great service well packed and my nephew loved it."
12096,3752,5," It came quick& the painting looks great all points of movement (I.e legs& knees& fingers& arms) move great except the neck however the head underneath does move. the look of the Bruce Wayne head looks unusual but is mostly covered so it made no difference"
12097,3752,5," As a 33 year old I don't have many figures these days but I am a massive Batman fan in particular The New 52 comics from where this sculpt of the Thrasher is from. So I decided to get this figure to display next to my copies of Batman. The head sculpt of Bruce Wayne is laughable and anyone will tell you this. So stick the Thrasher head on and never...... Never take it off.Solid figure standing 9inches tall. Good weight. Stands well. Ok articulation (all the fingers move independently which is nice). The paint is good and overall I'm pretty happy with the figure for the price. Think I'll buy a Talon figure to set the scene for the display."
12098,3752,5," Love the bat suit of armourIt's gigantic &sturdy with lots of little details like individually articulated fingers.ill have it fight my arkham asylum bane toyoh the joy"
12099,3752,5," It looks amazing and the articulation on this is great!I would recommend this product."
12100,3753,5," Excellent"
12101,3754,5," This is a charming little toy& well crafted and professionally painted. The tools he comes with seem out of place for the character but that can be forgiven as the overall result blends nicely with my sons other mine craft figures. Dan& I salute you sir :)"
12102,3754,4," wanted by small person& as described. personally& a waste of money"
12103,3754,5," The price had my bottom swinging off of its hinges but it's that squeaky bum time of the year. My son is a massive fan of this guy. Long lasting quality which is great considering the price!. But I have one happy son so all good and I forgive you lol."
12104,3754,5," Was for my son who is a huge mine craft fan. He was over the moon when he opened it on Christmas morning. Very happy with it."
12105,3754,5," My 10 year old son was super impressed by these - I thought they were over priced to be honest!"
12106,3754,5," This was for a present and have not received any complaints."
12107,3754,5," Fantastic product great value delivered well within the time"
12108,3755,5," As a model maker of many years experience& it takes something special to catch my eye& especially something factory produced. If you like Megatron in any capacity whatsoever& you have to love this. Some people have ornaments adorning their living space& I have a mini Megatron blasting away with a smirk on his face. And if I get tired of that& the extreme poseability means I have almost unlimited badass poses. A touch expensive& but I don't care. You get what you pay for here."
12109,3755,3," Megatron (Also known as Destron in Japan) was one of the first villains I booed yet admired as a child (he was a genius in some cases but not that good!). Being a fan of G-1 Transformers& I knew I had to get this as I wanted an  evil nemesis to oppose my Optimus. This little guy comes with several hands and  two heads with different expressions  He can be posed due to the swivelling and bending action of the joints into almost any postion& but this is not a toy per say...more of a model for collectors to pose and re-pose either on their monitor or a recreation of a battle with other Transformers.This can't be transformed.If like me you loved G-1 Transformers you'll need this guy for your collection!"
12110,3756,5," Perfect in every way"
12111,3757,5," A great POP looks brilliant& has been painted very well& only compliant is that the box was that the box was damaged"
12112,3757,5," Absolutely brilliant arrived 2days before it was expected only downfall was the box was damaged"
12113,3757,5," Can't fault this product&  beautifully gift wrapped also though smaller than I expected"
12114,3757,5," I bought this for my teenage grandson who was over the moon to receive it."
12115,3757,5," This is a present. but please with item and delivery time"
12116,3757,5," Fast service& product was as described."
12117,3758,5," My four year old daughter loves playing with these when playing with her Peppa pig toys."
12118,3758,5," Always love to send new figures to my grand daughter who loves Peppa and these are great"
12119,3758,4," Lovely little toy for children."
12120,3758,5," granddaughter loves it."
12121,3758,5,""
12122,3758,5," Arrived very promptly and my Grand daughter loved it"
12123,3759,5," This is a good figure. It's well painted and well articulated. If you liked the character and the game from resident evil 6 then I highly recommend it."
12124,3760,3," Was disappointed in quality of packaging considering this was supposed to be a new item!"
12125,3760,5," Everything was ok so im  happy"
12126,3761,4," My seven year old wanted this for Christmas. It was one of his favourite presents and is still being played with intermittently six months later. I have given four stars as I think all these products are grossly overpriced for what they are. But worth the money to keep a little boy happy :)"
12127,3761,5," Not as disgusting as it sounds& bought for 7 year old and the flesh sachet didn't freak him out mind you he watches dr who!"
12128,3761,5," it came well wrapped and in good condition and on time.it was better than expected well done keep up the good work"
12129,3762,5,""
12130,3763,3," Ordered two of these from different sellers. Should have been identical but weren't so don't know which one is or as genuine. My sons loved them anyway"
12131,3763,5," Good item"
12132,3764,4," Exactly what I'd expected"
12133,3765,5," My little man is a fan of The Clangers (as was I as a child !) and he loves it.Tap on - Tap off& and a different colour first each time"
12134,3766,5," Excellent"
12135,3767,5," great little gift and brilliant customer service"
12136,3768,5," wonderful item v happy and wonderful seller"
12137,3769,5," At last - the star of F# Bell& the Alan Moore written and Bill Willingham created Green Lantern AKA Rot Lop Fan now has his own action figure and this old fanboy could not be more pleased.Since you've already probably said to yourself& HUH?& allow me to explain...In 1985& DC Comics (publisher of Superman& Batman& Wonder Woman& Green Lantern& Catwoman et al) published a comic called Green Lantern Corps Annual #1 and Rot Lop Fan was introduced therein by the Bard of Northampton. Rot Lop Fan& or F# Bell& is inducted into the Green Lantern Corps by female GL& Katma Tui& who happens to be a human-like female albeit with purple skin (a bit like Sinestro).However& there's a problem with Rot Lop Fan and it's one that the Guardians of the Universe have forseen and its solution will be a test for the bold Katma Tui.If you want to find out what seemingly prevents Rot Lop Fan from becoming the Green Lantern for the sector covering the Obsidian Deeps& you'll have to seek out the graphic novel or trade paperback featuring the very best of Alan Moore's short stories& one-off tales and two parters published by DC Comics. Not forgetting buying the action figure& as well.When you do& come back and let me know what you think& please! You're in for a treat."
12138,3770,5," Great quality miniatures to expand your imperial assault forces.Also useful for RPG games of Star wars."
12139,3770,5," I don't know why but I like these guys the most right after Vader and the |qute doggies| from the base box. I know they're called Nexu& but I see them as qute& so they're doggies :) I actually own a cat :)Back to the item - buy them& you'll love painting them and be trilled to put them on the board."
12140,3770,5," Does what it's meant to"
12141,3771,5," I'd had this item on a wish-list for sometime and over Christmas got some Amazon vouchers and decided to pick it up.Firstly& the figure is very well crafted& as can be expected with most of the Revoltech line. You won't run out of poses soon with all of the extra accessories included. I definitely do feel that I've got my money's worth& but given how rare and expensive these figures are I'd probably only recommend them to fans of Lupin III."
12142,3772,5," This is a set of extra dice for the Imperial Assault board game& the idea being that players can buy their own set of dice rather than everyone sharing the single set of dice that comes with the game.  Also useful if you need spares or replacements should the original set be lost / stolen / eaten."
12143,3772,5," These are great - you know exactly what you are getting as they are the same as the ones supplied in the main game. Its just a shame that there were not two sets in it originally! Well done FFG.... !?"
12144,3772,4," its a new pack of dice& identical to the 11 that come in the boxed game. what more do you want?saves a lot of time rerolling whenever you have a powerful attack going on."
12145,3772,5," Very useful if you play with many minatures on the board. Great quality."
12146,3772,5," bought as a gift - and was well received"
12147,3773,5," Arrived early new and lovely. My son will love it! Hours and hours of fun to be had& playing with all his little figures."
12148,3773,5," Another lovely figure for our arena - a great way to hook boys into history without actual weaponry!"
12149,3773,3," ITS NOT BAD. BUT ITS TO SMALL..."
12150,3774,5," When I first saw this figure a few years ago I thought it was really cool. At the time I wasnâ€™t a big Green Lantern but in the last two years I become more and more a Hal Jordan fan.Hal Jordan made his comic book debut in Showcase #22 October 1959. This new Silver Age Green Lantern was created by John Broome and Gil Kane in a revamp of characters away from the magic and supernatural based stories of the Golden Age and replaced them with the science fiction based superhero stories.The Green Lantern of the Golden Age whose powers were derived from magic was named Alan Scott. Hal Jordan was the first human inducted into the Green Lantern Corps& an intergalactic police force. This new Green Lantern along with along with re-imagining of other DC heroes such as the Atom& the Flash and Hawkman marked the beginning of the Silver Age of DC Comics.Green Lantern Hal Jordan has been released several times in Mattel's DC Universe Classics. As the most popular Green Lantern Hal Jordan first appeared in Wave 3 of the line several times since with various differences all with the stand 21 points of articulation. This final release comes in standard package design for the series since Wave 16. This All Star figure was included as part of Wave 20 of the action figure line. All Star are a series of figure of DCâ€™s most popular characters re-released and sometimes with new paint deco for the purchasing by newer collectors. All Star figures does not include collect and connect piece. The Green Lantern is the final Green Lantern by Mattel's DC Universe Classics.To me this is the best DC Universe Classics Green Lantern figure available& and there has been quite a few. The new shiny metallic Green Lantern figure is great& the paint job speaks for itself.Read more â€º"
12151,3775,5," Beautiful figurine."
12152,3776,5," Wonderful& it came beautifully wrapped with a little cookie attached from Japan.I am sure the little boy who is having it for Christmas will be as delighted with it as I was with the delivery."
12153,3777,5," good toy& that is a toy i want to collected& perfect& if you have some new one& i will buy it at first time."
12154,3778,5," If I'm being honest& I enjoy this toy way more than the kids - not because they don't& THEY LOVE IT& but because I am a closet SUPER fan of Star Wars and I only wish this toy was around when I was a kid! It took 5 mins for the kids to get use to the controls but that is all& to be fair I didn't read the instructions properly because I was so eager to get going. The Star Destroyer offers great detail and it feels pretty solid too& I think it will last unlike other toys that are remote controlled.The kids and I have had hours of fun playing this cool toy - setting up the little figures (Darth& Luke& 3 Stormtroopers and 3 Rebel Fighters) blasting away and mowing them down is a real treat (especially when you take out a large number in one go). The other great thing is the figures can be played with without playing with the Star Destroyer as well& better still you can buy more figures and sets (and they're not that expensive on the scale of things).It's great to see original Star Wars toys still being made& let alone to this high level of fun& originality and imagination - I want more!"
12155,3778,5," It's a radio controlled star destroyer that fires balls. sign me up.  If you are a star wars fan and don't have fun with this then there's something wrong with you. never mind kids enjoying it I hogged the controls for about an hour as my nephew found various things for me to knock over. The toy comes with 8 figures 4 rebels and 4 empire baddies. the figures remind me of the old green army figures that were popular in the 70's and 80's. nothing special but they are for knocking over so not much else is needed. the star destroyer is the main event here and it pops open to reveal 3 green globes that you can fire using the controller and the ship itself can be moved around using the same control. It's powered by 4 AA batteries so not too bad and is pretty easy to control so kids as young as 5 can have fun with it. a few people have mentioned the price. yeah it is a little bit pricey but its star wars and its a radio controlled vehicle so if you compare it to other products of its kind its not too bad."
12156,3778,5," Bought this for my nephew's birthday present& not a star wars fan but i was surprised he said he really liked it and displayed it in his bedroom. A little while since given it to him and he is always playing it with his brother. It is definitely worth buying. It is nice to see them play together with a toy instead of on the computer."
12157,3778,5," My son has been onto me about this every time the ad has come on telly... I must say I am dubious about remote controlled type stuff like this& but was completely blown away by how easy to control& responsive and robust it was. The boy thinks it's amazing& which is the most important bit but it definitely gets the full thumbs up from meWas really easy to put together and I can tell this one is going to be a favourite for some time to come"
12158,3778,5," This toy has it all.  The boys got very excited when they realised it was remote control and it fires things.  This was just the cherry on the cake as they love anything S.W. related.  Many hours have been spent trying to knock down each others figures by firing the ammo.  The ship seems to open up a few different ways which keeps it interesting& and its on wheels so they can have proper battles between them on the floor.  As with anything Star Wars related& dad and uncle wanted just as much time with the toys as the kids did.  Just be prepared to buy one per child as they all want a go at fighting each other with them :)"
12159,3778,5," This is a great product for all avid Star Wars fans! It takes a bit of assembly but once put together is really easy to operate. The controls are in the instruction manual and once you get used to them they are very easy. This toy is certainly not slow and when my cat first saw it is was a little bit scared. I love the inclusion of the little figures which is a nice thing to aim at. Also the balls that you shoot out of the Star Destroyer have a very good range when you fire them and they shot across my kitchen and conservatory floors. All in all this is another very nice edition to the Star Wars franchise."
12160,3778,4," My son has only just discovered the world of Star Wars but is very quickly becoming addicted. This is a great looking toy and was an immediate success with a boy thrilled by the opening scenes of the original Star Wars movie. My child really enjoys getting lost in the world of Star Wars and couple this with a remote controlled vehicle that fires green balls& it's a winner. The hand control set took some time to master& and the requirement of 6 batteries adds to the price& but overall my son loved the toy and is interested in adding more vehicles to build up a collection."
12161,3778,5," We had hours of fun had with this item and it's one of the most iconic Star Wars STarship visuals& the imposing triangular shape of the Imperial Star Destroyer is probably my personal favourite in the movies& and thatâ€™s why its great to see it as the biggest element of Star Wars Command. Measuring over a foot in length& the Star Destroyer is a remote-controlled vehicle that can move forward and backward and turn a bit& before opening up and firing four clear green orbs at the battlefield. There are hours of gameplay in here which should keep kids coming back for more and more the characters themselves are nicely detailed& including exclusive Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader figures& plus three Rebel troops and three Storm Troopers."
12162,3779,5," keizer ghidorah is a kaiju who appeared in godzilla final wars and his trueform was monster x who fought angist godzilla .it bought this item because i need collected dragons and dinosaurs."
12163,3780,5," Fantastic product and service"
12164,3781,5," This toy was great. My son is a big Moshi Monsters fan and Mcnulty is his favourite.He was very pleased with it& because you know what your getting instead of opening a pack when you don't know what it is."
12165,3781,5," Another moshi monster i purchased for my grand-son's collection& which is growing!He of course& loves playing with this additional character from moshi monster range of figures& which ar cute!!"
12166,3781,5," no fancy wrapping&just the moshi&but thats all we wanted-so thumbs up from my children :-) happy kids"
12167,3781,5," Perfect for my little girl& as she only wonts certain ones easy and great price. Have order more thank you"
12168,3782,5," |THE FIGURE YOU SEE IN THE PICTURE IS NOT THE ONE YOU GET &INSTEAD IT'S SUPER SAIYAN 4 GOGETA YOU GET FROM THE DRAGONBALL GT HYBRID COLLECTION AS THAT'S THE ONE I RECIEVED WHEN I ORDERED THIS ITEM|Iv bought some of these hybrid action toys for my nephew as he likes dragonball z and he loves them. Looking at this toy it looks something like the old action force toys back in my youth days. The figures would be a great collectable for anyone who likes dragonball z/gt &the hybrid action figure is highly detailed and is between 4 and 5 inches tall depending on which figure it is and it's fully poseable with extra detachable hand parts and some come with accessories &looking at it the joints on the figure may wear down the more it's played with so it may not be very durable &the writing on the box is all in japanese except for the name of the figure &the words hybrid action and the dragonball z logo at the top of the box (the dragonball gt boxes are bigger and are mostly written in english and the back of the dragonball gt boxes have pictures of different hybrid figures from the dragonball z and dragonball gt collection).These figures are very pricey for the size of them but if you are a serious collector of the dragonball z/gt merchandise you won't be dissapointed with these hybrid figures."
12169,3783,5," Very happy with product and service. Thank you very much highly recommended"
12170,3784,4," I would have given it five stars but the eyes were all white and the sword handle isn't blue. Everything else is really good because the swords can come in and out of the case. Also the case can come off the back of Leo. The shoulder pads are painted on but I don't care. If you do buy it then buy  some others to go with it. Everything  else is the same as the picture.Jan."
12171,3784,5," Brilliant figure ! He comes with 2 swords and a case for them that you put on leonardos back. Although he is a great figure & hes paint job isent that great. They kinda left some stuff to paint & out. Overall he is perfect for a ninja turtle colecter or he is great for playing with if you've seen the new film."
12172,3784,5," these were a present for my 5 year old great nephew who is turtle mad at the moment& the delivery was brilliant and he was thrilled to bits with them& one happy 5 year old equals one very happy great aunt !!"
12173,3784,4," Bought this product for my nephew for Christmas as he has been asking for it  for a long time. I will give it to him on Christmas day& I know he will be pleased with."
12174,3784,1," cheaply made looks nothing like the photo. look like knock offs. Arrived well packed and on time"
12175,3784,5," I bought this for my 4 year old and he loves it. Only trouble is he wants them all now!!"
12176,3784,1," Item not 22 cm as described in product description& have returned the item."
12177,3784,4," Bought for my son (aged 5) for Christmas.  Good quality and robust."
12178,3785,5," An excellent game for Star Wars fans and also for people who don't know the films very well. The six different packs are fun because they show characters and scenes from all the first 6 films and the clone wars series. The mini gmes are well thought-out and bring new life to the basic idea of top trumps- the highest score wins. Hours of fun so far for my eight-year old son...and his parents. Highly recommendable!"
12179,3785,5," Brilliant product at a good price.  My stepson Loves it!!1"
12180,3785,5," Hours of fun for big and little boys!! Brilliant product!"
12181,3786,5," Probably my favorite of these large Jakks Pacific-figures. Details are spot-on. Bought this for about 7 pounds which is lower than the price of a 3.75| figure. Incredible."
12182,3786,5," Han shot first."
12183,3786,5," top toy"
12184,3787,5," Sturdy toy for spiderman lovers everywhere.  Unfortunately spiderman took a (well deserved) dip in the paddling pool and is now silent....."
12185,3787,4," Sturdy and big figure with movable arms and legs. My son is very happy with it. Surprisingly& the figure's head does not move& which disappointed a little. [Edit: It took some force& but now it does move. Probably the rubber/plastic parts were sticking to each other.] The launcher fixed to the arm is not removable& as it uses sound/lights and is connected to the main body which hosts the batteries.In the picture& the head's proportion and colors seem different. In reality the head is smaller and made of a different material. Also& while the figure does have several sound effects& the |Hero phrases| are hardly verbose - all I've ever heard is |Ha!| and one single |Spiderman!| shout. Not a big deal& but the declaration is a bit misleading (unless I'm missing something)."
12186,3787,5," My purchase of The Amazing Spider-man Electronic figure was excellent from start to the finish. the ordering was easy& the delivery messages kept me well informed& and my grandson's face when he opened it was a joy to behold. Well done."
12187,3787,5," Much better than the bigger spiderman we got before. A bit noisy but not annoying.  God quality toy. Highly recommended."
12188,3787,5," Solid& large& fun spiderman for the kids. My son 4 loves it and had to buy an other for his little cousin 3 who now sleeps with it. Much more solid than what is sold in other stores. Also arms and legs move which is a plus."
12189,3787,5," Bought this for my son last Christmas and he played with it lots& a durable toy which has withstood being thrown around by 'the Hulk'! My 3 year old nephew is now crazy for Spider-Man so this the perfect present for him."
12190,3787,5," I worried about this web launcher.  It launches the webs out of the dolls arm but doesn't do it too hard so my little one could have lots of fun without breaking the furniture."
12191,3787,5," The 5 star rating is more than justified from the point of view of quality and of delivery. Would highly recommend to anyone."
12192,3788,5," A great gift for any young Super Hero fan.  My son loves it and has played with it no stop!"
12193,3789,5," Great gift for grandson. And quick delivery"
12194,3789,5," Really pleased with this item. Great price. My son loves playskool superheros. Just a shame you can't buy the characters individually as we have now doubled on on so many"
12195,3789,5," My nephew loved this and played for hours with it. Thankfully the torpedoes don't fire too far ( I was concerned about the tv)."
12196,3789,5," super"
12197,3789,5," My little boy is absolutely over the moon it's great highly recommend! My boy is 4 years old his favourite toy he's one happy little boy"
12198,3790,5," so pleased i found this for my daughter for xmas she loved it and it was a great price !"
12199,3790,5," Bought for my grandson . It was at a great prize the toy itself is outstanding can't recommend highly enough . Would recommend to friends and family . Came as described in a well packaged box. Great price item and service."
12200,3790,5," Any imaginative child who enjoys role-playing with toys is likely to be delighted by this wonderful war elephant with ferocious rider. As always with Schleich& the detail is amazing& and the product quality very high. I got this for my grandson on his fifth birthday& and he played with it at once and for ages."
12201,3790,5," Another excellent quality Schleich model. Amazing detail& and an impressive beast to add to my growing collection! The service was excellent too - ordered on a Monday& delivered from Germany on the following Friday. Very happy customer!"
12202,3791,5," Cool looking toy"
12203,3792,5," Having been a long time fan of the Trigun series (both manga and anime) I was very happy to see that Vash was given the action figure he so easily deserves. Having previously bought a Raiden figure for the release of metal gear rising from play arts I was slightly disappointed to find him rather stiff& this figure series had none of these issues. Straight from the box he was possible and had him in many of the poses on the box and more& really only the face and feet needed a little working. Very high paint and build quality& most impressive being (well at least to me) it comes with a box to keep all the spare parts. Wether young or old this figure will provide a nice shelf piece to a really expressive toy. Would recommend revoltech and I see they also have an Alucard figure too.....The delivery time from Japan to England was excellent."
12204,3793,5," These sets are amazing! Good quality& good value and very nice. They're a toy soldier version of Star Wars but are even better quality. All the fine details are filled in and the stands hold up the figures very well& keeping the figures from falling over in the heat of a toy battle& for instance& if you put those sprinting rebel pilots on a normal bendy and unstable toy soldier stand& they wouldn't stand up for a second. The ships may be a bit bendy& but they can be straitened very easily. The little pull back stands are very nice& and good for ram battles with enemy ships. And last but by no means least& is Darth Vader and Luke& both made even more special and exclusive by their lovely shiny paint and lightsabers& excellent for a long duel (although i feel a bit sorry for Luke as he doesn't have a lightsaber.) But all in all this is a great product& along with all the other's& and i recommend it to any Star Wars fan."
12205,3794,4," Considering I paid the best part of Â£40 I was surprised at how small this was in comparison to other transformers. It was certainly not worth that amount of money.It was chosen by my grandson who was very keen to have it. I thought it would have been a similar size to others I have bought."
12206,3795,5," After seeing one of these in Toys r Us my daughter decided she wanted one for christmas but i didn't want to pay Â£30 for a figurine. This is much better value for exactly the same product."
12207,3796,5," Son happy"
12208,3797,5," Great thanks...quick delivery and item as described...thanks"
12209,3797,5," cant wait for more"
12210,3798,5," Love it. Huge center piece for my collection. Just need to make a Data.."
12211,3799,5," This is a very well made Mr Bean figure.I got it for my desk and it is a great ice-breaker as everybody that comes to my desk knows mr bean...It would be good for kids as well as it bends and you can put the figure in different poses.Great detailed paintwork.Nice purchase overall :)"
12212,3799,5," My son absolutely loves me bean& it's ashame there isn't much merchandise for him but as my son is 2 the size of this is perfect& it's just a stocking filler so he's not recieved it yet but hopefully as mr been is posable this will mean he's indestructible lol."
12213,3799,5," Fab Service and another cute gift which I cant wait to give on xmas day!!!! :)"
12214,3799,5," Excellent buy! Our little lad loved this. Very original. Arrived qickly too."
12215,3799,5," Fantastic little toy & my son who's nearly 7 is a massive Mr Bean fan and having received it loves it! I'd would say a high quality product as it's been bent in every which way and is still going strong. I would recommend as a toy and for the products durability."
12216,3799,5," My son is crazy about Mr Bean and loves this figure!"
12217,3799,2," This toy is quite good quality but a lot smaller than I expected and definitely not worth the Â£25 price tag. I happily would pay say Â£9.99 but feel very unhappy with what I got for my money"
12218,3799,5," Bought for my grandson and he loved it."
12219,3800,5," I have ordered this Morbs pack twice already.  My 5 years old son is obsessed with Morbs. This 3 pack is a great value as it includes the hats as well. The only thing is you never know what you are going to receive& I have had different pack on the 2 occasions I ordered so it has been great. Planning to buy more especially as the price is going down."
12220,3800,5," My 8 year old twin boys love these so much we have bought for gifts for friends who also love them. The buildings and plane etc are fantastic add ons. Shane these never caught on in the mainstream."
12221,3800,5," Excellent value and promptly dispatched. One very happy little grandson."
12222,3800,5," Kids love these hours of fun with them worth the money"

12225,3801,5," When Airarchnid got a release at the Revealer scale last year& she was considered something of a flop. Her Legion toy takes the same design with pretty much the same conversion process and makes it work. The reason? Simplicity. Where the Revealer figure felt to the need to work in the usual twenty step transformation& her Legion toy takes the approach of having something pretty straight forward that works - and would have arguably served the larger figure much better.Her robot mode& as she comes packed in& is fantastic. She's nicely proportioned and detailed and has some excellent paint apps. In addition to the purple used on her toes& midrift and forearms& she has some nice gold daubs on her knee high boots and around her face& plus some nice evil red eyes. It's the arms that are nicely done. Rather than the paddles of the Revealer toy& the Legion version has some proper limbs going on& even her legs seem that big bigger and better defined. She's much more sturdy and comfortable looking than the larger figure. Articulation is pretty decent for a Legion toy& with articulation at the shoulders& hips and knees. She comes with a ridiculously large crossbow weapon& which has a couple of ports on either side so you can cobble together some silly looking mega weapon from various Legion weapons. It's nice too that the Beast Hunters Legion figures come with less squishy accessories too.It's the impressive transformation that really makes Airachnid a great little toy. Whereas the Revealer toy was at pains to try and get the robot mode from the various panels of aircraft& here much of the Helicopter mode is on a large hinge that just moves away from the body of the robot mode& which affords space to accommodate the arms which are then covered by two bits of fuselage.Read more â€º"

12227,3802,5," This is a cool figure. Not a million miles from the vintage range version of '83& in looks and detail& and still a fig to give Jabba's men a run for their money. Its a great find& in this tri-logo packet& or in the purple pack of the Shadows of the Empire range. The modern 2012-2013 versions had dwarved Boushh to a more legitmate size with the overly big helmet& but I prefer- and recommend- this one. A true fig for any collection. A big thank you to the seller. Thank you!"
12228,3803,5," This was great!  Bigger and stronger than the other turtle bits and pieces I bought.  Takes a lot of bashing from my 2 yr old grandson and provides hours of play.  Thank you."

12233,3804,5," I love collecting funky pops and as soon as I saw this one I had to have him. He is bobble head so that makes him different also if you are a fan of gardens of the Galaxy you would of saw him at the end of the film.He looks great and is very well done the pain work is great and he looks great."
12234,3804,4," Very fast delivery& & only problem was that the box came slightly damaged (as any collector will know& the box is the main point to the collection) everything else was fine. The damage isn't too bad& but it is still visible and this was intended as a gift."

12236,3804,5," gotta love howard the duck great service"
12237,3805,5," Hasbro's second wave for the 30th Anniversary includes this fantastic figure of the prototype Boba Fett. You can see where the final designs came from and the figure is across between a Stormtrooper and the final version of the bounty hunter we've all come to know and love.The figure is incredibly poseable& with multiple points of articulation and comes equipped with a backpack& blaster pistol (which fits into his holster)& flame blast effect for the flamethower unit on Fett's left arm and even an alternate head for another helmet variation.The figure also comes with a silver coin which is for the album that comes with figure #1: Darth Vader.A brilliant figure and a must for all those Fett fans!"
12238,3806,5," My hubby is gonna love this."
12239,3806,5," Very good"
12240,3807,5," These were a stocking filler.  Our little one had one already and played with it for weeks& plus took it to school for his talk on something interesting in a box!  He demonstrated 'magnets' with it.Basically it's a ball& that pops open into a creature thing& when the ball touches anything metal (it comes with a card with metal in to facilitate this& but a spoon or any metal will do it) - because it has a magnet inside.  It's a little transformer thing really.There were three in our pack& red& blue and green.  They were a bit more plasticky than the original one we had& but did the job.  He has now moved on to botshots& but these were all the rage in first year at school among the boys!"

12242,3808,5," This was out of stock before christmas and sold at greater cost elsewhere! Amazon price is a bargain as this is a BIG set. You have to make up a leafy palace kind of structure - one warning you will need to push hard to fit pieces together & my daughter couldn't do it and neither could I & so it was a job for daddy ! . There are two floors to the main palace& a bell& a gazebo / tower with two floors& all the doors open the roofs lift off for better access. A flower pod bed bower thing opens to reveal a light which can be changed from white to pink & it can be blown on to activate too& strange as it sounds but quite magical ! The are petal stairs up to top level - all the units are separate and can be joined or moved around to suit play which is a good feature too. This set is marked XXL as it's not just the castle it comes with a Bayala elf/fairy figure& a little fantasy monkeyish thing&  a toadstool table with a big cake& a couple of flower seats  and several 'decoration' items including a chandelier! My daughter absolutely loves this castle & it's a very lovely thing !"
12243,3809,5," Lovely model. In the EU& the E-Wing was the intended successor to the iconic X-Wing& but it never gained traction with most pilots.The model stats are slightly superior to the X-Wing& but not by a great deal. 3 agility gives the ship a decent defense& and the three shields and two hull points give you an extra soak for a dreaded critical hit& as opposed to the X-Wing's 3 hull and 2 shields. The ship is& though& expensive to field"
12244,3809,5," Great addition to the Squadron!!Great ratings& tough ship& although costly on points to stack out."
12245,3809,4," Nothing wrong with the quality here& and nothing wrong with the stats of the ship...Its just an ugly ship!"
12246,3809,3," Ok now this is an EXPENSIVE ship in terms of points.You get one good pilot card (Corran Horn)& 2 astromechs and advanced sensors.There ARE good builds available if you take ONE E-wing (Corran Horn) maybe with two named X-wings for example but this isn't going to be a ship you ever take 2 of and probably won't take 1 of very often due to the points cost.The useful thing about it is it has several actions it can do& focus& target lock& barrel roll and evade which is very unusual for a rebel ship. If you add on the Push the Limit card to do 2 actions you have some options but its hardly as game changing as a Tie Phantom or a Falcon. The E-wing also has a straight 5 move which is unusually fast and a K turn at speeds 3 and 4. The best option for this ship is Corran Horn/R2-D2/Fire Control System combo maybe with a Falcon for a 2 ship list.Cards included..Advanced SensorsFlechette TorpedoesR7-T1R7 AstromechOutmaneuver"
12247,3809,5," Does what it says all good you play x wing you know what it doesJob done"

12249,3809,5," exactly what i wanted and delivered promptly"
12250,3809,5," Happy husband"
12251,3810,5," Authentic representation of Tricia Helfer. Wouldn't exactly call it a toy&more like an action figure. Extremely durable and also good for putting on display and admiring.Order arrived very promptly and was just as it was described on the website."
12252,3810,3," Excellent show& great characters but won't be collecting anymore of these! The service was great arrived earlier than expected. Packaging could have been a bit better but what really disappoints me is how this looks nothing like Six! Looks like a bloke in a red dress and blonde wig!"
12253,3811,4," Not really much to say about this statue&it looks awesome along side the Icons Aquaman&the paint is flawless on mine and the water is actually very realistic looking.Its the water that posed a problem for me though as this statue is extremely difficult to fit onto the stand&there are no instructions and nothing available on the web to guide you on how it's done.I literally had to slowly force mine into position all the time waiting for something to snap off&but it didn't and I finally managed to get it on there.This is the only fault I have and now she's done and on the shelf&she shines!"
12254,3812,5," excellent gift for star wars fan"
12255,3813,5," Watching a 30-year-old man turn into an 5-year-old child: Priceless!"
12256,3814,5," Hasbro kick off their first releases of 2008's The Clone Wars with a wave of figures from the upcoming movie. Unlike previous Star Wars figures& these are styled more on the animated appearance that they have in the film and not based on taking existing moulds and dressing them in the correct attire. Consequently& the facial features and body proportions may seem a little off to some collectors.The next in the series is #05: Clone Trooper& one of the legion sent with Anakin to the planet Teth under the command of Captain Rex.Like Captain Rex& the Clone Trooper is highly poseable and has head (rotational and vertical)& shoulder (rotational and abductional)& elbow (rotational and vertical)& wrist (rotational and the left has abductional too)& torso (rotational and vertical)& hip (vertical)& knee (rotational and vertical) and ankle (rotational and vertical) joints giving him a massive 25 movements of articulation.The trooper comes equipped with a gunmetal DC-15B rifle& a gunmetal shoulder cannon (which fits over his left shoulder) and a grey missile which launches from the cannon with the flick of a finger.For a figure based on a CGI animation this is a great reproduction and a cut about the figures released for the previous Clone Wars cartoon. A must have for all those army builders out there."
12257,3815,5," Rather cannily& FFG give us a reason to shell out for individual X-Wings and TIE Fighters rather than just buying more Core Sets: the separate expansion boxes include unique pilots and cards not found anywhere else.Worth your attention in this expansion more than any other is Wedge Antilles. Indeed& he's worth the price of admission all by himself and I have yet to see anybody field an X-Wing without him at the controls. He has the double whammy of being highly skilled (9) whilst also reducing a defender's agility (and therefore rolled defense dice) by one. All of a sudden the X-Wings and TIE Fighters become that little bit imbalanced in favour of the Rebels& and it shows in gameplay. Garven Dreis is a good support character too& and a host of droid upgrades are included that make this a worthwhile purchase.My one concern as per the X-Wing in the core set remains: this is a very delicate model& the cannons in particular& and needs to be handled with care. A top tip: should the cannons bend out of shape& run a glass of cold water& then hold the model gently in a pair of pliers and steam it over a boiling kettle. Bend the cannons back into shape& then dip the whole thing into the cold  water. For best results& refrigerate for a brief period. This has worked like a charm for my two models that got bent out of shape in transit."
12258,3815,4," Yes& its another tiny space ship for the X Wing game. Those unenlightened who are not fans of Star Wars might wonder why anyone would want to spend so much money on a tiny plastic toy. Some players who own the basic X Wing game may also wonder why they should spend money on another single X Wing rather than buying another copy of the basic set (which is undoubtedley better value for money).Well& the X Wing Expansion does provide several unique elements which you don't get with the basic set. To start with the cards you get include Wedge Antilles& and it seems the model itself is based on Wedge's ship. The reason I say this is because in the attack on the Death Star Wedge is hit on the right engine and has to pull out of the attack& and look there on the model the X Wing has a blackened& battle damaged right engine! Now its that sort of attention to detail that fans like me find hard to resist.As well as Wedge there are cards for Garven Dreis (Red Leader) and more droids and other options to upgrade and modify your ships. So although you might want to stick to buying the basic set if you wanted to build up a squadron of X Wings& its still worth buying the X Wing Expansion just once to get the unique cards& and a slightly distinct model for your game."
12259,3815,4," This can be found cheaper elsewhere. It is a good product and the pre paint is actually decent enough if if you are a miniature wargamer that look suspicious at the word pre painted. The only annoying things is that he does not bring all the possible X-wings pilot cards and upgrades. So for the pilots you still need the starter set if you want Luke Skywalker for example as well as ton of other different ships if you want all the possible upgrades"
12260,3815,3," Purchased this on amazon since the starter set and big ships were much cheaper than everywhere else. However this is not the case with this one& in fact amazon charges more then the RRP. The pre painting on this one was also probably the worst one of the lot I got  so I had it re striped and repainted"
12261,3815,5," Whats not to love about Darth Vader in a tie advance to lead your tie fighters against Skywalker and the rebel scum..."
12262,3815,5," This is a fantastic little model which looks great on the battlefield when flanked by a standard TIE either side.  Great addition to the game& which really benefits from the 2 shields.  Also comes with some great cards."
12263,3815,5," Dont underestimate the trusty old X-wing!After ignoring it for more exotic ships I've come running back. You just can't argue with the stats and the choice of pilots.Lots of world championship squads are just X-wings and for good reason.Check out the stats on Luke with Wedge and Biggs thats a cheap elite team you can get early on and kick some serious ass!With a stat line of 3&2&3&2thats 3 Fire power2 Agility3 Hulland 2 Shields.Pilot cards...Wedge AntillesGarven DreisRed Squadron PilotRookie PilotUpgrade cards...Proton TorpedoesR5-K6R5 AstromechExpert HandlingMarksmanship (This is the one your bothered about)"

12266,3817,5," Slow delivery as expected from China. Missed Xmas. But my son was happy when Santa came back because he forgot to give him a present. Smaller then expected but my son loves it so happy days"
12267,3817,5," Very nice toy! Arrived on schedule! Sensibly priced considering it was imported all the way from Japan."
12268,3817,4," A lot smaller than I expected. but great customer service from this seller."
12269,3817,5," My grandson is 5 years old and this was a gift for him& he was so excited after a couple of tries he was able to take him apart and put it together again. He was duelto a go on an aeroplane and was very worried about it& his daddy promised him he could take Devastator on the aeroplane with him and he was totally calm. So it was a great buy."

12271,3819,5," Harry is a moulded plastic figure standing approx 8| high& has a removable cloak (but not the sleeves)and comes with a coldron and a container of slime. Harry was purchased at christmas and has been my 4 years old girl's best friend and goes everywhere with her&irrespective of reality or imagination. The adventures they have are brilliant and the slime just adds to the fun. Don't just slime Harry& slime everyone. It's great& it doesn't stick to anything (apart from carpet)just slimes!! It does however change colour with time...from electric blue to a muggy& mucky green. Due to much love and affection& Harry has lost his glasses but that doesn't alter the fun. He still&8 months later is much loved but sadly yesterday was lost! Yes she's gutted& but hopefully Harry will return from his shopping trip very soon.....!!!!!"
12272,3820,4," Grandson liked them"
12273,3820,5," Excellent"
12274,3821,4," Looks great but articulation is a little lacking due to stiff joints."
12275,3821,5," For my son. He loves it"
12276,3822,5," My daughter loves this dark brooding cape crusader!! With well made and durable joint articulation& nicely styled and well contoured molding this example of the worlds greatest crime buster actually appears to live up to the photo!!!Even the integral cape mechanism seems well built and easy to use(after a fashion!).  May children the world over continue to fight the most cunning and ultimate wickednesses available in their wonderful and intriguing imagainations!!!  Great toy - to be recommended (TBR)."
12277,3823,4," Rocket comes in a purposely open style cardboard box& so we can see him. [This is so people can try before they buy.] The figure is well secured in the box when it first arrives and The Guardians of The Galaxy artwork is nice& featuring all four characters. This product is for children more than adult collectors. It's not a Hot Toy that's for sure but then I didn't expect it to be. The body is well made with solid plastic but the head feels like cheap plastic. This is probably necessary for the figure to open and close his mouth. It does look like the film character& which is a big plus! Rocket is quite big at approximately 10 inches wide and length. Rocket opens and closes his mouth& while saying various phrases from the movie. His blaster lights up different colours - blue& green and red. The blaster spins around (to simulate firing) and the character shakes& like the blaster has too much power to handle. There are two activation buttons& one on his leg and one on the blaster. Rocket will even tell you when it needs reloading! I've seen this product on YouTube and it goes for around $30 (Â£18) in the US& so I think it's overpriced in the UK. I would pay around the Â£20 mark& overwise it's too expensive. Kids will love this figure and it will put a smile on their parents face - for around five minutes. The figure makes me laugh occasionally when it says something out of the blue. You can set the figure to off& on or try me.Rocket says the following phrases.|The name's... Rocket.||Fine& but it's only because you're peer pressurizing me!||No need to be so bossy.||You gotta be kidding me!||It's Rocket time!||I told you I had a plan.||You sleep with the danger& you wake for the money& as usual.||Groot& we're gonna be rich.||Quill& I need ammo!||Locked and loaded!||You wanna get to him& you go thru us. Or& more accurately& we go thru you.||Quill& I need ammo!|"
12278,3823,3," This is a fairly large-ish toy which has a couple of buttons that& when you press them& cause the gun's muzzle to twirl around and Rocket's jaw to jabber while he utters a phrase from the Guardians of the Galaxy movie. The gun makes various blasting sounds and& if you put the figure on a flat surface& Rocket will move forward a bit as the shuddering movement is quite strong.It's well-made and cool-looking but I'm not sure how much fun a kid is going to get out of it. I mean& pressing the buttons and watching the gun's muzzle twirl around? It's kind of limited& really& and after a few tries& I expect a kid's going to get bored of it and move on."
12279,3823,3," Once out of the box Rocket is a fairly substantial toy made of brightly coloured plastic& the joints are fairly loose so he rattles& but he is able to stand upright unaided.  The bar on top of the gun activates the sound samples which aren't especially interesting and they are easily drowned out my the sounds of the mechanism.  Sadly& he just doesn't do very much more than this and I have to agree with the others that suggest that he offers limited play value."
12280,3823,3," Not as expected. A bit overpriced for what was on offer. It has been played with but only intermittently."
12281,3823,3," I think this is fairly Naffbut my Grandson is desperate for one - it's top of his Christmas list!"
12282,3823,5," Big Blastin' Rocket Raccoon. Defenately one of the highlights of the Guardians of the Galaxy line by Hasbro.Not only does the toy have lights (through Rocket's gun) and sound in the form of Rocket Raccoon's quotes and laser effects& but the toy vibrates as it's being fired. It's also a slightly interactive toy& with Rocket telling you when he's low on ammo& of which you replenish by pressing the top o his gun (you also press this for the lights and sound in Demo Mode) and then press the button on his left leg to fire and hear random phrases that he has to say. Overall for it's price& it's a superb toy.It comes with batteries for the demo& but when they start to run out& you replace the batteries by removing the front panel on Rocket's back pack with a Philips Head Screwdriver and insert three AA alkaline batteries to replace the old ones. So it should be pretty simple to replace them. The only thing is that Rocket's tail is it's own piece and you have to attach it yourself. There's a square hole in his rear which matches the base of the tail and you really need to press it in hard into the hole until it clicks& therefore it's then in place and fits perfectly& even though for a moment you may or may not think you might break the toy& but Rocket is made of very sturdy plastic& so he should be fine. :)Bottom line& this toy is fantastic and I hardily have any complaints at all for this guy. Here's hoping that Hasbro will make a nice alternate version for when Guardians of the Galaxy 2 comes out in a few years time. :) This toy though is highly recommended or all Rocket and G of the G fans everywhere."
12283,3823,5," This racoon action is a big hit with my 7 year old son and great value for money. Good range of phrases and sound effects& great volume& bright lights and toy itself is robust and a decent size. Love it and wish all character toys were as much value for money. Batteries seem to go on and on."
12284,3823,5," Bought for grandsons birthday. It was bigger than we expected and he absolutely adores it. A great addition to his Guardians of the Galaxy collection."
12285,3824,5," The toy was a good item and completed my sons collection. The delivery was fast and the packaging was excellent.How ever the fact that every pack of the scooby doo mansion figure pack comes with a scooby doo means that if you complete the collection you end up with a load of scoobys i think maybe they could of put different ghosts instead of scoobys which would of given them more variety. Apart from that good sturdy item that will keep the scooby fan in your family entertained for ages."

12290,3829,5," Hasbro continue to celebrate Star Wars' 30th Anniversary with figure #49: 7th Legion Clone Trooper.This one is a repaint of the 2005 Revenge Of The Sith super articulated Clone Trooper but without the comm antenna and has all the poseability of the previous release with head& shoulder& elbow& wrist& waist& hip& knee and ankle articulation.The trooper comes with a removable helmet and a new release of the standard Clone Trooper blaster rifle. This one is more detailed and comes with gunmetal paint detailing making quite a nice weapon. There is also a silver collector's coin that goes in the album with figure #1: Darth Vader.A good Clone Trooper and a must have for all those army builders out there."

12296,3832,5," This figure is very detailed and is just beautiful& the only problem I found was& it can be a bit fiddly if you want to change the part on the striker unit that attaches to the stand.This was my first Kotobukiya purchase& and after seeing the quality& i can say this won't be the last."
12297,3833,5," Christmas present for my grandson also bought the burger flip out playset.Both sets fit together and he loves playing with them."

12301,3834,4," I first came across this item in about 1994 and& being a young Doctor Who nut& saved my pocket money and bought 3 of them. The Dapol figures were absolutely fantastic in their own way - the accuracy of each one was... interesting (let's not forget the 2 armed Davros or 'chubby Dalek') but for a British company to be making toys of a British TV show at the time I think we can give the slight design flaws a break eh? The style here is the definitive 1980's streamlined Cyberman (Earthshock - Attack of the Cybermen) and is definitely among the top 3 Dapol Doctor Who figures in terms of accuracy. Sadly& not quite so much in terms of durability - the handles on the sides of the head won't withstand much and one drop is really all it takes to knock them off. If& however& you're handy with tweezers and super glue& you can repair them. They didn't come with any accessories like a gun but& regardless& it's a wonderful item. Recommended most for serious collectors either on card or in a display case for longevity& but most importantly& love it"
12302,3835,5," Bought this for my granddaughter as she collects them so she was so happy when she opened it"
12303,3836,5," This Product is out of this world. A must for any Halo fan.......and for the price it's a steal.Attention to detail and quality is fanstastic& photo's do not do this product an justice.Statue come with four arms and 3 weapons for different poses.Super fast delivery from seller."
12304,3836,5," My son already had the red Spartan so it was no great surprise that he wanted this to add to his growing collection. As before this is has very good detail."
12305,3837,5," Kids loved them"
12306,3838,5," Brilliant item and very fast delivery Thankyou"
12307,3839,5," Wonderful gift -  my grand-daughter will love it to add to her unicorn collection"
12308,3839,5," Great figureine and arrived quite early which is slways good very happy"
12309,3839,5," Perfect bath toy for older girls"

12311,3839,5," Another addition to collection"
12312,3840,4," The Unleashed Battle Packs are by far my favourite Star Wars toys and its a real shame that Hasbro never finished the line.  This particular pack& like most of the  range& includes four figures.You get Princess Leia in her iconic white gown and Danish pastry hair do& armed with a stormtrooper blaster and positioned in a well-posed action stance.  The downside to the dramatic pose is that Leia has no articulation.You also get Darth Vader.  There are a few renditions of the Dark Lord of the Sith in this toy line and unfortunately this one is among the worst.  His lightsaber arm is positioned at a very strange angle and he has no articulation& except for his right hand which is positioned in a choke grip.  Perfect for throttling...Captain Antilles!  The Rebel leader is well sculpted and is articulated at the shoulders and neck& which is the best you can hope for with the Unleashed line to be honest.Completing the line-up is an Imperial Commander.  He's well posed with one arm behind his back.  The other arm (in which he is holding a blaster pistol) is articulated& as is his neck.All of the figures are moulded to integral bases.  Vader and Antilles appear to be on grey rock while Leia and the other guy are on metallic-coloured plates.  This set has great play value& offering you a mix of goodies and baddies and combines brilliantly with the other  Tantive IV sets (Stormtroopers and Rebel Blockade Troopers).  Vader's weird pose lets it down a bit but still a great set!"
12313,3841,1," Item is not what it looks like on the picture.Its bright green and rectangular with darkhelm fx symbol.The is no actual description on the discription page but if you really investigate youll find it says bright green somewhere.Very weak material.NOT HAPPY. Too late to return since its a christmas present!"
12314,3841,5," As stated the colour may differ & my son recieved a green beyblade stadium and he was so happy & he is obsessed with beyblades & seeing his face light up made my day & the stadium is of a good size and great quality & prompt delivery & so happy with the purchase & thank you xx"
12315,3841,5," My son loves his stadium he play every day day with it ðŸ˜ƒ"
12316,3841,5," Works as it's supposed to do"
12317,3841,5," Very good!"
12318,3842,5," Fantastic arrived in perfect condition this is great for marvel fans like me"
12319,3843,1," Unfortunately this was very flimsy and broke within a couple of times of playing with it."
12320,3843,4," Good product."
12321,3843,2," Product turned out to be very poor value for money& coupled with appalling service is not what customers of AMAZON would deem acceptable."
12322,3843,2," I was expecting the large size transformer. I will be returning the item"
12323,3844,5," hey"
12324,3845,5," Another superb Star Wars statue duo by Kotobukiya. Highly detailed with an almost bewildering array of arms and legs to allow an extensive range of poses& these Stormtrooper figures come greatly recommended. If you have the money and space to build a Stormtrooper army or just want a couple of examples to add to your Star Wars collection there's none better than these. If anyone knows where I can get hold of a couple of spare torsos I can attach these extra arms and legs to then please let me know- shame to waste them...!"
12325,3845,5," I just can't det enough of these Artfx stormtroopers& really good moulds and they look good on display.I will put them in the display cabinet with the others.The army grows"
12326,3845,5," Absolutely brilliant addition!"
12327,3846,5," Great looking figure and quite easy to transform."
12328,3847,4," Saw this Thor statue on display at Universal Studios in Florida and just loved the detail. Found one on amazon.co.uk as soon as I got home and placed my order. Not disappointed. Fast delivery and box unscathed& though much bigger than I imagined for the size of the statue. Unfortunately there was some evidence of the statue having possibly been a shop display with some faded blacks on the base and a small witness of what appeared to be a cover up with black paint. I am normally very fussy about this sort of thing but the thought of sending it back to the seller (somewhere in France) did not appeal& so I placed it on display in my living room and quickly got over it. The detail and proportion of this statue is excellent and& for the most part& withstands close scrutiny with surprising ease. This statue comes with two versions of hammer& one spinning (shown in most on-line images which can be mistaken for a shield) and a still version. This is a cool bonus and would have been perfect if not for the right hand holding the still hammer having unrealistically short fingers. All in all a great addition to my collection of Marvel statues and busts. If it had arrived in mint condition I would have given it 5 stars."
12329,3848,5," This is my personal favourite from the current selection of Star Wars Command toys& and it's up against some stiff competition.The Star Wars Command range of toys basically consists of |army men| two-inch figures based on characters from the Star Wars movies.  As a concept& that has to be almost impossible to beat.  The only things that come close in living memory are Star Wars Lego or& better yet& McDonalds' Indian menu.  It includes vehicles too& which are out-of-scale with the figures in the time-honoured army men tradition.This set includes a great selection of figures and gives you goodies and baddies so you can get battling straight out of the packet.  Luke Skywalker is there& lightsaber aloft and cast in gold-coloured plastic& with four ewoks for back up.  All four ewoks are in the same pose and colour and& while some variety might have been nice& still look great ranked up together.  They face off against four biker scouts& moulded in white and featuring two each of two different poses.  Finishing the figure line-up is another scout trooper& in a repeat of one of the existing poses& but moulded in a gunmetal grey plastic.The x-wing is the same as that found in a number of other packs and is neatly moulded with its wings open.  The AT-ST walker is really nice-looking and is& I believe& unique to this set.And all this for the same price as one 4-inch figure?  What's not to like?  There are hours of play time in this set alone& and more still when you mix it up with other sets& and no danger of losing little guns and accessories up the hoover!  These are so good& after my son got bought his& I went out and grabbed myself a set to use for wargaming.  They're ideal for that& and can look great when painted.Read more â€º"
12330,3848,5," Well packaged& fantastic price and it's Star Wars! What more can I say. Grandson will love it."
12331,3848,5," Great - son really loved."
12332,3849,2," I bought this guy& Phasma and a First Order Stormtrooper for my Star Wars mad nephew but even though he was chuffed to bits with them& I had issues with the look of them. The Stormtrooper was very badly painted& Phasma looks good but is just painted grey not chrome but Ren was awful. The silver paint round his mask looked like it had been done by a heavy drinker with the DTs. His silver belt buckle wasn't even finished as half the silver was missing and don't get me started on the mixture of cloth and rubber for his costume. These figures aint cheap and my nephew picked up on the errors right away as he has most of the Black Series figures and most of them are really well presented. Are these figures shoddily done to quickly get them out in the shops by the time the movie hits theatres? It's a shame The Force Awakens Black Series figures are this badas the OT ones are really good. Give these a miss unless you can get them real cheap."
12333,3849,3," I bought this with a First Order Storm Trooper as well. I'm disappointed. To me& the Kylo Ren seems a bit shoddily moulded. Injection moulded seams are clearly visible in places& the lightsaber seems like a quickly created afterthought with quite rough edges. Part of the clothing is fabric& which is nice enough& and part is a nasty rubber/plastic composite which seems an odd combination (surely even some cheap fake leather would've been better?). I wouldn't consider this a good buy.I don't really understand why this costs so much. The Storm Trooper is noticeably better (though even that has a problem holding on to the supplied guns)."
12334,3849,5," This is an excellent figure that I've really been looking forward to picking up. Kylo's mask is nicely detailed and his unique lightsaber has been recreated very well. The articulation is good and the costume's made out of some nice quality material. Probably the best model of Kylo you can buy at the moment."
12335,3849,4," Pleased with this purchase. I really like this one& although I would've loved being able to switch looks byhaving the option to remove the hood/rubber cloak. That way& you could achieve that slick look from later in the film.Perhaps that's for another wave of this Black Series."
12336,3849,5," This figure is amazing... this is the first black series figure I have bought and it is just fantastic... the detail is amazing and can get into so many poses. I love how there is an option to pose the hood of the figure... i just love it"
12337,3849,5," Very good figure. Great detailing especially on the material of Ren's costume and like the real cloth parts.You can get some really dynamic poses out of this figure with it's extensive articulation."
12338,3849,3," I like it but mine was missing some silver paint on part of the head& other than that it's good but quite disappointing that I recieved one with faulty paints apps considering the price tag ......"
12339,3849,5," Very pleased with this figure good quality sculpt  and the combination of cloth and plastic make this one of my favorite from 6|black series"
12340,3850,5," This is a charming statuette of the lovely Kuroyukihime& and with the inclusion of the Haruyuki Arita pig avatar& nicely represents this characters relationship with the main protagonist. The wings do need to be attached separately with Care and one of the arms needs to be detached  to place the pig avatar in position and then replaced& but this was not too difficult. Very pleased with this purchase."
12341,3851,5," I have to admit to being a little reluctant to buy this initially due to the relatively high ticket price for a single ship/model.  However having decided to bite the bullet I'm incredibly glad I did.  The model itself is huge in dimensions (as it should be) in comparison to the normal fighters& the detail is great and the paint job is suitably weathered and realistic.  So much so you could probably use this in a fan movie if you so desired :)In addition it comes with a wealth of cards and accessories to enhance your game experience and grow upon the basic game.  If this is the quality of epic/capital ships that are going to be released for this game series it will become a massive hit as time goes by& especially with the new movies in the pipeline.I'm looking forward to future releases in this series& although don't go expecting a star destroyer any time soon as if built on the same scale it would be unbelievably huge and no doubt carry a price tag to match :)"
12342,3851,5," Great Model - nice detail and paint jobComes with loads of additional ability and action cards and has a massive attack range of 1-5 (compaired to 1-3 for small and large ships)Adds a whole new dimension to the game when playing Epic matches (250+ points per squad)Even if you are playing smaller point games you can use these huge ships as obstacles (1 huge ship can be used instead of 3 asteroid tokens).....just buy it!"
12343,3851,5," Awesome quality& however the main reactor shuts down too easily"
12344,3851,4," To be honest I have only really used it as a scenic item& for which it is lovely but a bit expensive!!I think X-Wing works better with fighter sized models& but if you are interested in buying one the quality of the model is excellent& I do not believe you will be dissapointed."
12345,3851,5," A must-buy for any dedicated X-Wing Miniatures player. The detail of the ship model is extraordinary and worth the price even if you buy it as a collector's piece& but the addition of Huge ships totally transforms the X-Wing Miniatures game from a quick-fire tactical game to an epic strategic battle requiring a whole evening to resolve& adding a whole new layer of depth and reward to an already superlative board game."
12346,3851,5," This is a great addition to the star wars x wing miniatures game. Ideally& it would suit epic play more than regular squad building. There are some crew cards included in this set that are highly sought after& can anyone say C3PO?"
12347,3851,4," You can't fault the detail and quality of this model& and I love that Fantasy Flight added a couple of larger ships for some variety. Even if you don't play the game this is still a lovely model to display.Where the problems lie are with both the price and it's useability. It's way to expensive& and a little too large to realistically use in a game. The only way you could really use it would be as an objective& a stationary piece of scenery& because most tables I've played on would barely allow this thing to manoeuvre. It also feels a little large& and when I saw the rebel transport next to it (which I had always imagined as a much bigger ship) this dwarfs it!"
12348,3851,5," Not had chance to use it yet but great to display and you can still use cardsNow where is the raider"
12349,3852,5," Nice little figure"
12350,3852,5," Great thanks"
12351,3853,5," good no damage"
12352,3854,4," 2 small figures perfect for younger fans. no posse able figures in good positions. could provide hours of fun good stocking fillers."
12353,3855,5," They arrived well packaged and on time. Bought for my grandson& who was heavily influenced by my son.These types of figures can vary a lot in price. From Â£4.90-Â£40+ best check full price& by which I mean the price stated and the 'postage' price. These prices are like a seesaw."
12354,3855,5," Grandsons loved these."
12355,3855,5," Son loves"
12356,3855,5," Great"
12357,3856,4," great figure"
12358,3857,4," Son loves them"
12359,3858,5," would highly recommend good quality product and agood size aswell plus the mask comes of so the kids can wear it which is a bonus"
12360,3858,4," Good quality& no problem with it"
12361,3859,5," Very nice figure& great articulation combined with a great sculpt. Must have for any street fighter fan"
12362,3860,5," As with all  Playmobil sets& we were impressed with the quality and detail in these sets. We'd been waiting for the Fairy sets to become more widely available and were not disappointed when we finally got some!The fairies themselves are just beautiful& the animals are just magical. We have a large collection of  Playmobil& so love being able to add new animals& character and accessories. These fitted in well with our previously purchased sets."
12363,3860,5," Birthday gift for my granddaughters 4th birthday. She loved it. It has small pieces but the recommended age is 4+ and I think this is spot on."
12364,3860,5," granddaughter was very happy with this game and rated it 5 out of 5."
12365,3860,5," Great item. Christmas present well received. Delivery time good."
12366,3860,5," Niece's birthday present. Seems v happy. Quick delivery."
12367,3860,5," Excellent toy was well received by child and played with"
12368,3860,5," Got for my 4 year old niece and she really loves it"
12369,3860,4," A present for a unicorn mad girl who was very happy"
12370,3861,5," Really coolThis bust is in my opinion one of the best busts! It's extremely |life like| and it's kind of creepy that the head is hollow! But of course& thats the way it should be!As cool as the pictures of this bust are& they pale in comparison to the actual creation. I've always thought that the Ringwraiths were the creepiest& most disturbing villains ever and this piece captures that feeling perfectly. Nicely done!Excellent paint job and sculpting. The gauntlet has a genuine rusted/weathered metallic look& and the fabric of the cloak is perfect. A Must Buy for all Lord of the Rings Collectors.."
12371,3862,5," All funko POP! Vinyls are pretty cool& but this Ghostbusters Slimer figure is absolutely perfect.Firstly& when was the last time you even saw a Slimer figure? The pure fact that funko has produced a Slimer a figure is reason enough for any Ghostbusters fan to purchase it.  Secondly& funko have managed to capture all the qualities that make Slimer the awesome character that he is in their own unique style of figure.  Lastly& the quality of this figure is amazingly high for the price.He sits on my desk at work and I couldn't be happier with the purchase :)Highly recommend for any Ghostbusters fan."
12372,3862,5," Bought this for my husband as part of our wedding anniversary gift. His favourite movie is Ghostbusters and he totally loves this figure! It's so cool that Slimer is not just on a stand but is 'held up' by his slime."
12373,3862,5," Now this is the type of figure I really like.  I'm actually not a 'massive' fan of Ghostbusters& although I do like the films/comics/franchise.But this figure is awesome!  I love the way he's rising out of his slime& the translucent colours and his grin"
12374,3862,2," I am a pretty big Ghostbuster fan when i saw slimer aka oinion head i was over the moon to buy it unfortunatly i was shocked when it arrived the box its self was fine perfect but the pop was not the slime looks like it has been poorly glued back on and the left arm is partly broken i have chedked with a few other slimer funko pops and what mine has there do not it is bad i do love slimer one of my favourite things about ghostbusters but this is just so bad :("
12375,3862,5," I haven't really warmed to these 'super-stylized' POP vinyl figures in general& but this Slimer figure is really cool. The use of translucent green 'slime' to support him is simply brilliant& even if a bit on the cute side. It was a bit smaller than I expected& without the slime he's only about 7cm tall& but I suppose that's part of the charm. Recommended for any Ghostbusters fan."
12376,3862,5," A great pop-head collectible. Slimer is part of the Ghostbusters collection& or the 80s icon collection& which includes other characters like Gizmo from Gremlins. Slimer is a really fun character& with his infectious grin and dripping green ooze& that also forms his stand& he's a fantastic addition to my daughters collection."
12377,3862,5," I recently became infatuated with these figures and Slimer is probably my favourite in my collection. Couldn't be happier with it. :)"
12378,3862,5," I have him sat on my TV/PS3 desk. He alway's lighten's my mood. The |Ectoplasm| look's more like a nasal excretion."
12379,3863,5," Bought to complete collection& great addition to our collection"
12380,3864,5," Bought for my nephew as hes a typical 5 year old who love tmnt. Bought for Xmas so not sure how it works yet"
12381,3865,5," meets all the expectations"
12382,3866,5," I really enjoy this toy!It includes:1. 360 turning head2. Sucker&eye and gun available to take off3. Casing opens up to reveal mutant4. Mutant and goo inside (Plastic)5. Wheeles (360 turn)6. Realistic to the real DalekFans of the show will love this toy!Especially the Dalek Fans of Dalektopia!"
12383,3866,5," My little boy was absolutly made up with the Dalek& looks the same as the hand print one but not to him! just another one to the collection! Not very heavy but seems to be quite durable. He really enjoys playing with it along with his other DR Who toys..."
12384,3866,5," Big selling point for recipient! Easy to |reveal| and replace the cover (which is in front behind the plunger-thingy and egg-beater.) Does not sit on a shelf& but has handled the domination of The Doctor and a 7 year old boy (and multiple friends) well since Christmas."
12385,3867,5," As said before start of the collection.  Love anything weird.  It started with the hell raiser geezer. Nice one guys.  Lets have some more unusual figures available to purchase."
12386,3867,5," Quality better than what I thought it would be. Just needs a way of sticking base to dashboard. Otherwise excellent"
12387,3868,5," Love it"
12388,3869,5," It's Batman!"
12389,3870,5," 100 %  satisfied  very quick delivery A++++"
12390,3871,5," well pleased with delivery and packaging& my son is a collectamaniac and is collecting all the figures from the teams that are in the premiership and available."
12391,3872,5," good"
12392,3873,5," A definite opportunity to own a piece of memorabilia recognizing an achievement  which in all honesty is unlikely to ever be repeated."
12393,3873,5," The jacks surporter was pleased."
12394,3874,5," As there are not many new Glasgow Rangers Soccerstarz I just had to get this little fella and he is well made indeed . Hopefully they bring out some more of his team mates so I can have a full squad ."
12395,3875,4," Great I found what I wanted to complete the set that I was unable to find on the high street."
12396,3876,5," My grandson loved it! Really good value too!"
12397,3876,4," A bit of fun for a sport mad six year old"
12398,3877,3," Once again the Soccerstarz boys have made a lovely figure& the equivalent of a penetrating pass or mazy dribble& only to ruin things at the end& the blazing-the-ball-over-the-bar finale.  I mean& look at the putative Neymar face....it's not a bit like him.  Unlike the man& the model has a pronounced chin and this bod has very dark hair& when we  have all seen the blond/brown combo he has sported all his time at Barca.  I seem to be the only person bothered by this& but really& getting so much right only to come up with such a poor likeness is not very impressive."
12399,3877,5," Fantastic little model of the superstar from Brazil who is lighting up the Camp Nou .Well worth the price an arrived very quickly an was well packaged.Will order again from them .Thanks guysMes Que Un Club"
12400,3877,4," This was a little bit smaller than expected. It was given as part of a gift to a 12yr old Barcelona fan& he thought it was great."
12401,3877,5," This is my sons favourite player and is really happy with this."
12402,3878,5," My son was desperate for this and after saving up he purchased it and to my surprise it actually is remote controlled and he loves playing with it."
12403,3878,5," Good quality solid product."
12404,3878,5," my grandson loved it."
12405,3879,1," they cant withstand the weather the hooks break off and the socks get lost this happened on the 2 ibought then on the 2 replacements my caravan now has no socks on but thanks for the refund"
12406,3879,4," not used it yet but it looks and feels good& will be using shortly& and looking forward to seeing it flying in what i hope is just a light breeze& as i will be on holiday."
12407,3879,5," This windsock is great for finding your van on a busy site& people ask me we're did you get windsock& its great Try brook it'd they are very good .thanks"
12408,3879,5," good quality material. bigger than i was expecting but on a 7 metre pole is no problem. good service arrived safely in safe packaging."
12409,3879,5," Perfect for the job. Flying high in our big garden and impressive with the vivid colours.Quality product and well made. Thanks"
12410,3879,5," Love this wind sock looks good on the campsite shame I now do not have a pole to fly it from as the top broke"
12411,3880,4," I've used this kite several times in the last month and it's very easy to fly (once you have enough of a breeze).  If there's a good wind& you can launch it on your own but I've found it easiest in all wind conditions if a friend helps.The hand grips are moulded plastic circles and they are very comfortable to use.  The line attached to the kite with clips& making it easy to set up (you don't need to tie the string to the kite).  It also makes the kite more secure.The only downside is that the kite comes apart very easily on impact.  This is obviously better than parts of it snapping but if you have to retrieve it and put the poles back in place after each (slight) impact& it gets annoying.Overall& this is a good beginner's kite."
12412,3880,4," i got this kite last week and hav been waiting for a windy day to fly it. then yesterday it iwas perfect and i shot up into the sky and flew like a dream. this is my first kite and so i have on experiance in flying but after reading the flite manual for 5 minuits i kenw how to fly it. the amazing thin about it is that it is so light at 220g and the wing span is bigger than me at 5fr 7in from tip to tip. it comes compleat with all the lines and everything you will need to start flying. the only other ingreadeant is a nice windy day. this is well worth the money. howers of fun ahead with this 10/10"
12413,3880,5," What a brilliant kite this is ! very easy to fly quick to set up and pack away!! I bought this kite to teach my son how to fly them at 9 its to big for him as a strong wind would take him away! so plan worked! And I get a great kite again! He now has a smaller version of the kite! and both of us go down to the beach and have a lot of fun flying both kites !!!THis is a product I would recomend to any one  who will listen!!!"
12414,3880,4," I brought this kite to take on holiday with me& the delivery was fantastic I had the kite in less than 24 hours (standard delivery). The kite was easy to set up and comes with a good carry case. It comes with good instructions to help you get the best enjoyment out of your kite. After a few disapointing attemps I got the hang of it and it was flying wonderfully. at one point I even had a bit of a crowd. However my moment of fun soon came to an abrupt end when my new kite nose dived into the ground. This I admit is not the falt of the kite it is the falt of the pilot& however the kite did sustain some damage upon impact. The center pole has split and snaped in two. So I am having to replace this with something that is more durable. Although I had not anticipated this extra cost it is still a good kite and heaps of fun to fly !!!!!!p.s you can look up the correct way to land a kite on you tube to help prevent this from happening !"
12415,3880,5," This is a great Kite.&Built from premium quality components. with |6mm-Carbon Rods| and |Braided-Dacron| Flying-Lines. Large 170cm |Sail-Area|.

12416,3881,5," Stomp rockets are great. Our 2-and-a-half year old loves his. We bought these rockets to go with a regular stomp rocket launcher that we've used in the local park - the thinking was that these foam missiles would be better for indoors when the weather is rubbish. I'm pleased to say that they work perfectly with the regular stomp rocket launcher& so you don't need to buy a |junior| launcher to go with them if you've already got a regular launcher.They're a slightly snug fit but they still fire a reasonable distance. The fact that they're lighter means they have a shorter range and are less likely to knock things over then they're falling down after hitting the ceiling& but be warned that a direct hit from one of these will still knock over a full cup of coffee!They're supposed to glow in the dark - a neat idea but it doesn't seem to work too well. Not a major drawback though as firing them in the dark could lead to all kinds of breakages..."
12417,3881,5," I've reviewed the actual rocket. Best money ever spent on kids' toys& ever! The refill pack is a necessity as the rockets are not indestructible. Frankly& I think they are expensive when compared to buying the starter kit itself& but hey they're only 4 pounds and the ensemble is a must have for days outside with the kids. If you want to give it some wellie youself& make sure you have plenty of room - the rockets can travel higher than a 4/5 storey building no problem!"
12418,3881,3," I've always had these foam rockets but one of the little children pulled the blue wings off& another bit the head of the foam...I then bought the yellow plastic ones which fit the original stomp rocket& are much more durable and easily spotted!Great outdoor game for girls and boys! from age 1.5-10!"
12419,3881,5," They are what they are.  Extra rockets for the Stomp Rocket Junior.  My kids love the stomp rocket& and after a few found their way into neighbours gardens and on the roof& a few more were essential for continued fun.These appear to be exactly the same as those that come with the stomp rocket junior."
12420,3881,4," These are the refills so don't buy without the launcher!!With the launcher they are tremendous fun.  Two year old grandchild ran miles picking them up whilst I just launched them!Also enjoyed by granny& son"
12421,3881,5," Bought this for my grandson's 4th birthday along with Stomp Rocket Junior . No sooner than it was out of the wrapping paper he was peppering the ceiling with this! A great toy with fun for all the family."
12422,3881,5," Tighter fit than the ones in the original box - which makes them harder to power into the air& but they go further as a result so I am not complaining!Otherwise identical to the originals."
12423,3881,5," If you get the junior stomper you can expect to lose or damage the rockets sooner rather than later.  Such a popular toy that it definitely pays to get the refill at the same time as you get the toy!"
12424,3882,5," I went camping with my kids and their friends and bought two of these and 4 long handled cheap ones. We were away for a week and& though the long handled ones were more popular at the beginning because they could |fish| off the bridge these nets SURVIVED& they were massively manhandled& left in the stream overnight& snagged on thorns and used to pick up stones and yet they still look perky and bright. Brilliant. The other 4 nets did not last the week (two of them didn't last the day)"
12425,3882,5," Great quality& good size to catch butterflies& though I am not fast enough to have caught one yet!  Love Melissa and Doug products."
12426,3882,3," lovely fun net for using in the shallows. brought for a birthday gift. when it eventually arrived 2 weeks late!!"
12427,3882,5," Great product& its durable& brightly colored and is generous in size and proportion.  My son has a great time trying to catch butterflies and in the winter like to play catch the foam ball with the net.  Great price and quick delivery."
12428,3882,4," Bought this for my 1 year old but have realised it's way too big. Will be better when he's older. Nice& good quality net."
12429,3882,5," served its purpose. Used this in an aria and it served its purpose as prop very well. A good buy"
12430,3882,5," My toddler was desperate for a net to go fishing but I wanted something that would last longer than the usual flimsy nets you can get where the net detaches from its stick after a few uses! Great quality product& with pretty& unisex colours! Pits shorter than the usual flimsy fishing nets but perfect for my toddler's needs. Would recommend."
12431,3882,5," This is a great net for those with smaller kids - it isn't too flimsy so it won't break as smaller kids tend to be more heavy handedGood size net and fun coloured handle - the kids loved catching bugs and looking at them through the magnifying cup we also bought"
12432,3883,3," I like it but not quite so popular with the children for some reason. The tins are good quality although the bean bags are full of fluff not 'beans' and I have substituted my own bean bags."
12433,3883,5," Brilliant product which went down a treat with adults and kids alike! Super quick delivery too!"
12434,3883,5," Exactly what I was looking for and arrived early"
12435,3883,5," really good for the money& well packaged"
12436,3883,5," Kept my 4 year old happy !"
12437,3884,5," This is a real sturdy stunt kite. My grandson is 10 now and only beginning to get to grips with controlling it so you can imagine the crashes it has endured since I bought it a few years ago. It is still like new and takes the impacts well. Would recommend this make to any kite enthusiast out there. I love the video that you get with it which teaches you& among other useful information on flying& how to make the simple knot and just loop the flying line around it. It never comes undone. It does take a lot of patience for a beginner though as you need to unfurl the line due to uncontrolled spinning."
12438,3885,5," We bought these as a gift for a 5 year old girl. When they arrived they seemed a little on the small side. But they aren't for adults! We're pleased to say that the recipient loved them and we've been informed that they are regularly played with. The velcro is pretty sticky so the ball actually sticks too. Nice design and well made."
12439,3885,3," These look really nice and my kids like to get them out but the Velcro bits aren't really big enough for v small children. My kids are 2 and 4 and they would do better with the big round cheap ones you can get at the supermarket& so that there's more chance of them actually catching and sticking."
12440,3885,4," This game is a lot of fun& but its not always easy for a 3yr old to understand that they have to |catch| the balls in the frogs mouth."
12441,3885,5," Excellent toy for rainy days indoors which is how it is being used during this wet winter. Sure it will be good outdoors too& later on."
12442,3886,4," As its a present didn't want to open it but looks good & should really rate it after using it .really quick delivery  which is always good."
12443,3887,5," It arrived on time& had great assembly instructions.  IS easy to fly and yet powerful anough to give a 170cm tall chld a 'flight' in a force 5.  We love it."
12444,3888,5," Great fun very fast in strong wind easy to fly .to small for kite boarding."
12445,3888,5," Good beginners kite& attach your lines and go."
12446,3889,4,""
12447,3889,5," I wanted to brighten up my garden this summer so I thought a Pinwheel might be a good place to start so I ordered one via Amazon.It arrived  a few days later thus prompt delivery and good service.Assembly was easy-peasy assembly - it took me about 1 minute.Now with a reasonable breeze& it offers 'whirling' magic moments for children and adults alike.Watch my video - it says it all!"
12448,3889,4," Bought a pair of these for my veggie garden as a bird deterrent.Have tried various others over the years but they tend to break apart at the first sign of a strong breeze.These however are by far the best Ive tried.Very strong nylon material could withstand very strong winds.A very attractive addition to the garden and a very good deterrent for birds in the veggies&would highly recommend for the great value it is."
12449,3889,3," I purchased the pinwheel from Amazon to replace a similar one now 4 years old which had colour fade.The price was around that paid for the original at a NT kite fair.Officially it is to educate my granddaughter (now 4) about the wind - speed& power etc.. In reality it's a colourful toy for me to watch from my armchair as I watch the nearby bird feeders.UPDATE OCT 2013: the nylon blades are |rotting| and breaking so cost was for one year. Rims have become distorted over time."
12450,3889,5," I love the colour and size of this& but it was a bit bent up when it arrived& and I feel the quality could be better. However& I bought it along with some different ones to act as a Heron scarer& and it works. :-) Humans 1& Herons 0"
12451,3889,5," I am only a recent convert to the visual joys of wind spinners.This wonderfully colourful triple pinwheel has in the wind the threepinwheels spinning clockwise &counterclockwise in any combination. The visual effect is stunning - so much so that I purchased a secondexample. If you have an interest in adding a colourful addition to a garden scene & then seriously consider this product ."
12452,3889,5," Very pleased with this pinwheel as it is strong against winds and is extremely pretty.  The grandchildren love it.  We like to believe the herons are not too partial to the rapid spinning as it does so in the slightest of breezes!"
12453,3889,4," I bought this for my friends 4 yr old& who absolutely loves her windmills& this one is huge and colourful and she adores it.Made with really high quality materials& and colours are vibrant&so ideal & highly recommended"
12454,3890,5," Apart from the fact this kite has scared away the wind& this kite is great. It's the perfect size for flying with kids& and packs nice and small. We've had my 3yr old fly it and my 8yr old loves her kite too...I suspect any older and kites may loose their appeal& but is there are few simple pleasures better than flying a kite at any age."
12455,3891,4," Brought one of these for my son and have had loads of fun with it myself so decided to get another one for me.I Would recommend this to anyone that wants a simple to fly fold away kite that comes with it owns bum bag. Loads of fun."
12456,3891,5," Been flying this LOADS since I got it. Absolutely great fun and amazing for the money. Huge amount of pull for the size and turns very quickly.I just managed to snap the lines but that's my own fault for flying it in a howling gale. Replacement lines dead cheap from Brookite anyway."
12457,3892,4," My grandaughter loves this"
12458,3893,4," Great globe& looks lovely lit up with the earths night sky"
12459,3894,5," I bought this windsock (and a pole from here) as a novelty object for the garden and to give my little nephew something to look at when he plays in the garden! The windsock is a cracker! Well it's a fish to be honest. Anyhow& the fish is approx 1 meter long (100 cm) and is very colourful indeed. The colours are bright and vibrant. The material is ripstop nylon and feels very tough so I imagine will last for ages. The fish looks graet blowing in the wind and can be seen for miles! (well hundreds of yards where I live!) I'm very happy with it and it makes a good addition to the garden as long as there's some wind of course! I think I'll get some different ones and you could even replace the windsock with a flag for the world cup. . . . Come on you Italy!! or champions league. . . .come on you Liverpool!! Okay wishful thinking nowadays :-("
12460,3894,5," I am a pensioner and next door to me there are 5 children. Years ago I put Christmas lights up in my back yard. The children next door loved them so much I left them up and turn them on nightly.  I saw the windsock and thought it would cheer my yard up for the children even more.  All the folks living near me have commented that it looks cheery"
12461,3894,5," I bought this with a 4m pole and two ground spikes. First use was on a camping weekend that turned out to be wet and windy.  No problem at all& it took the high winds like a 'good-un!'.It was battered by high winds and rain all night and it still looked as good as new when I was packing it away. I don't know how well it'll stand up to UV during the summer& but It looks good and it 'flies' the right way up too!Would I buy the same sort of product again? - Yes& I would."
12462,3894,4," We bought this to use at Cropredy Festival as last time we went there were lots of them flying in the air!It is much bigger than i thought and a really nice bright colour so it will stand out in the sky :) We love it!"
12463,3894,5," I was looking for a colourful windsock for my garden and found this fish. Its very bright and well made - it has been out in all weathers over the past few weeks and survived well.  Ive found it tends to get less tangled up than some I have tried in the past and it copes well with the strong winds we get here. I would recommend it"
12464,3894,5," Strong& very colourful& easy to attach.  We have three flying from fishing-rod style bamboo canes. The noise& movement and colour has brightened our garden and the (occasional) dull days."
12465,3894,4," Purchased to relace an ageing similar item.Nice and bright&good quality&good service from supplier. Used for fun and to deter sparrowhawks from swooping in on our garden birds."
12466,3894,5," I was looking for something like this to use at school. As we are a school with International Students and it was Japanese Childrens Day& I was looking for something to celebrate this day with a child. He was delight ed that I had found something like he would have a home."
12467,3895,4," great little stocking filler"
12468,3896,4," I have tried out 4 different types of boomerang as I needed to select one for Boys Brigade prize and this one was the only one I could get to come back.It doesn't seem very durable but it will be quite safe to use on the street or play ground as it is soft and turns in the smallest radius of all the ones tested.To sum up if you want a boomerang which actually comes back to you buy this if you want a stick buy any of the others."
12469,3896,3," Cant honestly say this is great at all...yes its tricky to use for sure& and we have only got it to do as it should once or twice.very lightweight and not sure the bending of the 3 arms up or down make alot of difference( it says on the instruction about all this) so I'm disapointed to be honest&..they may well work really well for someone who persists with them& but no child would I dont think"
12470,3896,5," Very nice& i'm happy to bought it. It is easy and simple to use. I like it! Thank you all"
12471,3896,5," Very good product& easy to use& a lot of fun.My 5 years old son worked it out from the 1st time throw. Really easy.You just have to remember following instruction on the back of packaging& turn wings up a bit& twist the wings inside a bit. Then it will fly back to you when you throw."
12472,3896,1," No good indoors at all unless you live in a mansion! Even outside they are just too poor quality to be any good& let alone last long when the kids start scrabbing over them!"
12473,3896,2," I bought this item in part because of the good reviews it has& but I have to say that I am dissapointed with it: the boomerang is more little that it appears (a picture holding the boomerang would help solving that) and it doesn't fly as easy as the reviews says.I tried many times and sometimes it returned& and sometimes the boomerang flexed and went to a strange flight."
12474,3896,5," This smaller size boomerang is soft so its perfect for younger kids to catch - great for indoor use. After a bit of practice& my 6yr old could make it fly well."
12475,3896,3," I got this after reading the reviews& but was disappointed.  Following the instructions on the back of the card& I still couldn't get it to return.  All my family members tried but it didn't come close.  Pleased it didn't cost much but it would have been nice to work."
12476,3897,5," my son love it and quick delivery thanks"
12477,3898,5," Just what the little one asked for a pink kite. I hope she likes the design and will have a lot of fun with it. Just as described"
12478,3899,5," Excellent service beautifully made kite. Would recommend"
12479,3899,5," Lovely."
12480,3900,4," This kite is easy to assemble. And looks great.It needs moderate not too strong winds to fly. it has a stalling angle (about 80 deg) since it is basically a wing and then it turns upside down and plunges toward the ground at a startling speed (even dangerous) but this problem is easily  solvable by just making a few steps toward it or giving it more line so it catches the wind again and straighten it self up. It is sturdy as hell!Caught itself in a tall tree and I managed to yank it of it with no damage and it fell to the ground at the amazing speeds and not a scratch.Highly recommended to advanced fliers. Not for young children without supervision."
12481,3900,4," Bought for my six year old. Easy to assemble and fly. Looks effective in the sky. Whilst other kites struggled to fly this went up on the first try."
12482,3900,5," The delivery time was quick& the kite was great. It was a present& and they loved it. First time it was flown they had great fun& and not only kids but all who were passing stopped to watch& and some took photos of it flying in the sky."
12483,3900,5," My grandson loved this& it looked amazing when it was in the sky& it was huge. Speedy delivery and a happy wee boy."
12484,3900,5," This is an excellent product for the price very well made and very& very easy to fly& its child's play"
12485,3900,5," Decided to spend more than a fiver for a kite& as out previous ones were quite rubbish.  Â£13/Â£14 seemed like quite a lot& but the difference between this and our old kites is huge.  Takes little to no effort to take off& so you don't need to spend ages running back and forwards& then it just DOESN'T COME DOWN. EVER. We had to pull it down when we were finished& it just didn't want to quit.folds up into a neat little bag ready for next time.  Also looks really awesome& like a bat signal or something."
12486,3900,5," The kite was really good my son really liked it he was really happy and also when he is not playing he can fold into the bag which was provided with the kite this way it stays secure and safe over al it is good value for money"
12487,3900,5," have tried my different kites these are wonderful my three year old grandson can fly it unaided will go up from the ground and single line is great no tangle problems  would reccommend for young children and big kids also"
12488,3901,4," we like it& and it is easy to carry around& but the light itself is not very bright (needs to be pitch black for it to be visible) but it's for tiny terror to use when exploring& so we're fine with it."
12489,3901,1," Bought 5 of these for my own kids and to give as gifts. They are sturdy enough as are most melissa and doug toys but they emit very little light. I was really looking forward to giving these to my 2 sons& ages 2"
12490,3901,5," This has been a great purchase. My daughter is a little afraid of the dark& not so much in the house but going out at night time. Not anymore! She will bring her torch for walks or in the car and shine the way. She's now chief navigator! Also& the batteries are securely tucked away with no possibility of a child being able to get them out which I think is a great safety feature."
12491,3901,1," Bought this for my three year old for his birthday. Poor quality off/on switch - so it gets stuck on. Very frustrating for him and me. Can't return it as I bought the gift a few weeks before his birthday and now I'm out of the time period to return it."
12492,3901,4," Very cute torch. My 3yo and 5yo girls will love this at xmas. Its smaller than i expected but actually a good size for kids. Havent seen it working yet but would recommend so far!"
12493,3901,5," Was a hit with our little one. He can easily switch it off and on& lovely design. Doesn't have the brightest light but I don't feel it's too much of an issue for a kid's torch."
12494,3901,5," Great flashlight& bought it for my 3 1/2 yo and she loves it& very light and the on off button is very easy to push for her little fingers. I would recommend."
12495,3901,5," This is such a great gift& especially for little ones who have a fascination for lights. Looks robust and arrived well packaged and promptly. Thanks."
12496,3902,5," Brilliant - grandchildren (and son) thoroughly enjoyed it.  Pretty powerful - flew a fair way.  We bought another one - so we could return the 'flight'.  Great fun."
12497,3903,5," I first saw these flying model flapping birds near the Pompidou Centre& Paris& on a school trip with the pupils in the early 80's.  We& the pupils and myself& bought the street vendor's entire stock of them& so he gave us the bag aswell. I told the children to leave them with me& packaged up and to only use mine.  I was then accosted by a very pompous (Englishman Abroad)chap& who must have thought I was a street vendor and demanded that I sell him one for his little lad. When I explained that they belonged to my (40) 'kids'&he became even more irate& causing me to perform a whistle drill& to line up ALL the pupils& for a head count.  |Who want's to sell this man their model bird for Â£20?|& I said.  There were no takers!  Testement indeed to the impact these models had on the children. I still have that 'One' which I used for many years as a teaching aid& in Secondary School Science."
12498,3903,5," This is great fun. Our boys love it. The only problem we have is that when we took it outside the wings came off. They do stick back on but we thought it was an outdoor toy. However& when we use it in the house it is brilliant.We will try it again in the warmer weather because it may be that it was just too cold."
12499,3903,5," I used one of these during a sketch in church on Christmas morning. It flew in such a lifelike way& round and round and way up high - the congregation was wowed - and so was I!(I didn't mean that as poetry - but on reading it I see it is!)"
12500,3903,4," This would have got 5 stars only we broke a wing when getting it out of the packaging.  With a little tape it still flies and is worth the money but be careful when opening"
12501,3903,3," Used a few times. Tricky to get best flight if wind is blowing. Quality ok lasted about 4 weeks and used about 6 times. Price too much for this item& wouldnt buy again."
12502,3903,5," got this for my godson now his mom has purchased lots for his friends - feedback is they fly really well and give a lot of fun outdoors"
12503,3903,1," What a disappointment. The quality is *very bad*. I used it just once and the wings got lose& the glue is awful. Please check the picture. Now it does not fly anymore.Update: Amazon replaced the bird for a new one.I just tried it again the same problem. I tried it once only and the wings unglued. The first time was not a coincidence. This product has no quality& its pure crap."
12504,3903,5," This went down a storm with my 4 year old niece. A bit complicated for little fingers& but a bit of help from Daddy did the trick.It's fairly robust and beautifully coloured& she can't wait to take it to the park."
12505,3904,5," We bought this glider for our six-year-old son in Germany in summer 2012. It has been on many outings with us where it provides loads of fun for our son& friends and the rest of the family (young and old). It it very well balanced and flies beautifully& stays in the air for quite some time and depending how it is thrown& displays some exciting aerobatics. However& ours lost its rubber nose quite early on and I would recommend that the glider is only flown where it can land on soft ground& i.e. grass or the beach are ideal. The polystyrene is durable and can cope with hard landings& however& the wings and tail are quite thin and won't like being trodden on& so it is probably not suitable for a very young child unless there is supervision. All in all& a fabulous glider which has given young and old much happy playtime over the last few months."
12506,3904,5," This toy is well made and aimed at a large age group. We went to a friends house who have a 9 year old who was running around with it& one of his favourite toys apparently. My two year old loved it so bought him one and what a hit it has been."
12507,3904,5," Great interactive outdoor toy& goes a fair distance and is quite sturdy. Would recommend& but keep away from trees and obstacles"
12508,3904,5," Gave this to my grandson for Christmas hours of fun but avoid trying to fly it in a strong wind"
12509,3904,4," Bought for my 5 year old son& does what it is meant to glides very well"
12510,3904,5," Hours and hours of fun shooting this around the garden. It is surprisingly sturdy and even though the little man falls out quite often that is more to do wth my 4 yr old than the toy. It became the best of the birthday presents!"
12511,3904,4," it really flies if you throw it right!!! bought two of these for my 4 year old son's birthday and were very excited!! i do the throwing for now but my guess is that soon he will be able to do it as well"
12512,3905,4," A lovely little addition to brighten up any garden"
12513,3906,5," Does exactly what it says on the tin.  Shrinks tissue so it is nice and taut on a balsa wood frame.  Also toughens the tissue when dry.  Takes water base paint fairly well for finishing but may need two coats of paint.  Unlike when I was a kid& you don't get high on the fumes either!  Economical in use.  I just doped a 16.5| wingspan model and the level seems to have barely dropped.  Getting more."
12514,3906,4," Great product& very little odour& and no need to thin."
12515,3906,4," good replacement for spirit dope with less smell and good results."
12516,3906,5," follow instructions and this stuff is superb"
12517,3906,4," best diluted 2 parts EZE with ! part water."
12518,3906,5," arrived well packaged&cant wait to use it"
12519,3906,4," Not used yet but am sure will be fine."
12520,3907,5," This kite literally takes seconds to pop up& is really colourful and easy to use!  My little girl loved it so much I had to get the fairy one for her sister! Great product!"
12521,3907,4," Attractive design. Easy to pop-up& though it struggled with gusty wind."
12522,3908,5," Wanted a safe& reasonably priced dart-board for our grandson and this fits the bill. He was made up with it as part of his Christmas present. He and his little friends played for ages and had lots of fun.Darts stick securely to the board. We just need to mount it so that it looks more like the one we bought for the adults and he'll be pleased as punch.Highly recommended for youngsters."
12523,3908,3," Excellent board - strong& good looking and child-proof& though the darts are rubbish.  These have a plastic head with a small magnet insert and just bounce off all the time. Replaced with cheap magnetic darts the whole head of metal& which stick like crazy.  See https:"
12524,3908,5," I am really impressed by the quality of this dart board. I bought it for the nursing home I work at and its perfect. the magnet is really strong and the darts attach easily."
12525,3908,4," The other reviewers are right - the darts are a little fragile. 2 magnets fell out of 2 darts almost immediately. However& a little bit of superglue later and they are both fine. The board and game itself are really fun and work well. I was concerned the magnets wouldn't work - but they do. We've had this for a week now& and played it every day. It's great fun. My 8 year old son loves it."
12526,3908,1," Played on it once and the magnet from the darts came off from two of the dartsreal shame cause it was a Xmas present for my son"
12527,3908,1," I can't see anywhere on the listing that this product is used& not new! However the box was battered and when I opened it I found that the dart board had scuffs all over and even a line from a blue pen across part of it! Not impressed& this was supposed to be a present for a child's birthday& I can't give it to anyone now!"
12528,3908,5," This is a great dartboard and the darts are pretty good. Good value. It's a shame it doesn't come with some kind of string or hook thing for hanging& but hey& you can't have everything."
12529,3908,5," I bought this for an elderly friend who lives in a care home for people with dementia and everyone else in the home loved it so much that I ended up buying a second one so that my friend could have one in his room and there could also be one in the communal room.This is safe and very easy game.  Even the wheelchair users could play it - we just put the board lower.  I love it."
12530,3909,5," Love the product and the size is amazingly bigger than I had in mind recoment to any one wanting to take part in a kite festival"
12531,3909,5," Great value for money"
12532,3910,4," This is a really tricky skill to perfect. My daughter has problems with her co-ordination and I bought it to help her with this....she will pick it up and play with it for a short while however her success rate at getting the ball in the cup is not great and this may determine her interest in it. That said it is well made and will stand the test of time"
12533,3910,2," I thought it would be bigger than what it is& string that the ball is attached to is very long more suitable for a teen to adult& not good for a 3 year old."
12534,3910,5," Nice quality traditional wooden toy& great stocking present."
12535,3910,5," Great"
12536,3911,5," This has stood up in really strong winds with a variety of flags on it. Really does its job well"
12537,3911,5," Does what's requiredTo"
12538,3911,4," great service and item"
12539,3911,5," all good"
12540,3912,5," While not a big 'gun' fan for children's presents& I thought this would make a great 'stand-by' gift. I think it will be suitable for playing with outdoors in the warmer weather.I wouldn't describe a 'gun toy' as educational& so that is why it lost points.It was good value& arrived quickly& and was well packaged."
12541,3913,4," O what a heart-break ! The kite was a smash hit for my grand-daughter until her little friend accidently let go of the string ( they are both only 4yrs ) and they both cried and cried ! Oh Bless."
12542,3914,5," Does what it says on the label. Filters your hot tub water."
12543,3914,5," Excellent filters. Helped keep our spa water very clear."
12544,3914,5," Using the fllters keeps the water clean"
12545,3915,5," Brilliant love it great family fun"
12546,3915,4," Great fun - folds up very neatly - string gets tangled easily enough so it's handy to have a helper when flying - would recommend"
12547,3915,5," Looks great in the air. Friends have said they want to get one too!!!"
12548,3916,4," Lovely lady bird torch. Light isn't that bright but I suppose you wouldn't want it too bright incase kids shine it in their eyes. My nearly three year old enjoys shining it on the ceilling and making shapes in the Dark."
12549,3916,4," Very cute torch. My 3yo and 5yo girls will love this at xmas. Its smaller than i expected but actually a good size for kids. Havent seen it working yet but would recommend so far!"
12550,3916,2," No problem with delivery but within a week the push button pushed down and would not pop back up again."
12551,3916,5," Brilliant only ordered Friday arrived today (Sunday)"
12552,3916,4," Kids love this sturdy fun and bright little torch"
12553,3916,5," Granddaughter just loves it very well made."
12554,3916,5," My 3 year old daughty loves it."
12555,3916,5," Excellent service and product"
12556,3917,4," Gave this to 9 year old son as a stocking filler. It was tricky to put together& requiring quite a bit of parental help.  Instructions not altogether clear& there is one part which is named but not actually used it seems (P3 I think).However& once put together& son is hugely enjoying this& much more than other gliders which just slot together.  The wings really do flap& and it's been flown a few times and is still in one piece.  Son says 'don't send towards trees as it can swerve into the tree'& and 'from the ground& throw it up'.A much higher quality item than I expected!"
12557,3918,4," Once it's in the air& the Aurora Box kite is a thing of beauty and there's nothing else in the sky that looks quite like it.  Getting it into the air can be a little bit tricky at first& it needs a noticeable breeze in which to fly and will need more wind to lift it than some others.You need to read the instructions carefully before trying to put it together& but once you've got it& it's very easy.If I had a complaint& and it's a very very minor& it would be that it needed a longer string."
12558,3918,5," my lil nephew loves this so much he bugs his mum and dad daily to go fly it daily -wind or no wind bug away my lil dude ..."
12559,3918,5," superbly made kite  flys really well"
12560,3918,5," Cool"
12561,3919,5," This kite is very easy to fly so ideal for beginners& even in light winds.It is a lot of fun& but I prefer to use longer control lines so I can fly it higher.The only things to be careful of is& because it has so much lift it will break in strong winds& and the wing tip spreaders are very small and can easily be lost&but it is a great kite and I love it."
12562,3920,5," I've bought it to my partner's nieces and nephew& but after opening it I'd love to go kitting myself."
12563,3920,5," These are great and arrived quickly"
12564,3920,1," Looks a bit naff tbh"
12565,3920,5," wow! it's awesome!"
12566,3921,2," I chose this product as a present and was very disappointed when the box was opened and part of the box content (ryegrass seeds) was missing. In my view the product is also overpriced for the plastic quality and content. It is also very difficult if not impossible for a child 4+ years old to assemble the plastic figurines/pots due to an effort required to put the parts together. Very disappointing."
12567,3921,5," Item as described& thank you"
12568,3921,5," Excellent!"
12569,3921,5," Looks like it will be great fun"
12570,3922,5," Check the size as this was suprisingly large when it flies& but its got a decent clasp and fills with wind easily. Would recommend atleast a 4m pole to fly it from. Looks fab!"
12571,3922,5," good product delivered quickly"
12572,3923,5," A really good set& about the right size for a 6 - 7 year old.  A nice strong spade for digging& a good brush.  Just what he wanted to help daddy in the garden and to go on exploratory digs."
12573,3923,5," Our grandson loves to help in the garden and this set is great for him. He has used it since he was 2 and should get a few years out of it. The tools are good quality and he likes putting the gloves on. We keep the set in the shed so the bag is very useful to keep everything organised. Very pleased. Need to buy a broom as well."
12574,3923,4," The rake is the weakest link as the metal prongs are prone to bending but overall good.Gloves were the surprise hit with three yr old."
12575,3923,4," My ten year old was very happy with this. The gloves were perhaps on the small side& but apart from that this gardening set seems very good& and not the kind that breaks after a day's use. The spade is solid and the bag is handy for storing everything in."
12576,3923,4," Good mix of tools& but bag not really  much use.  Shame the handels are fixed and not telescopic.  My grandson particularly liked the gloves."
12577,3923,5," This product looks great& it's a Xmas present for my granddaughter& so time will tell if she likes it or not! The set looks good and sturdy for little gardener."
12578,3923,5," Good selection of tools for junior gardeners plus easy to carry in the bag provided."
12579,3923,4," two year old is very pleased even though she is a bit small. loves the gloves"
12580,3924,3," Looks good and easy to put together. However on the first flight the stitching came loose& the kite came crashing down and one of the fibre glass struts splintered. After a bit of home repair& its up and flying again - quality is not great but for the price can't complain too much and it is easy to repair.It flies very well and is very responsive. Should note you need a good wind to keep the kite up in the air& it can be a bit temperamental in fluctuating winds.Great& inexpensive stunt kite that can do some pretty neat tricks. I would recommend& just remember to take some repair tape when you take it out!"
12581,3924,5," niece loves& gerat kite& good quality. great communication with seller."
12582,3925,4," Up and blowing well& keeps me and the grandchildren happy& also teaches them the points of the compass. Item looks well made so hopefully will last."
12583,3925,5," THIS IS MY THIRD SHARK MY FAMILY ALL WANTED ONE QUICK DELIVERY AND SATISFIED THANK YOU"
12584,3925,5," Perfect delivered on time good price and as advertised"
12585,3925,5," Very good quality looks lovely flying in the wind"
12586,3925,5," Purchased for a pressie& looks good though."
12587,3925,5," Excellent product and the kids love it"
12588,3925,4," Fun product for all festival fans."
12589,3926,4," This was a Christmas present for my great grandson and as far as I know he has had great fun with it xx"
12590,3927,3," I've tried getting this to return to me time and time again& watched various vids on YouTube to show me the right way to throw it and still cant get it to return. I'm going to assume its just me as opposed to a fault with the design but still the instructions could be significantly clearer on the right way to throw this."
12591,3927,5," Good fun& difficult to learn how to use it effectively so it actually comes back."
12592,3927,3," Daughter loves this use indoors for best results"
12593,3927,5," You throw it& it comes back. 10/10"
12594,3927,5," It's ok my daughter loves it"
12595,3928,3," This was purchased for my partners two year old grandson's birthday.He enjoys playing with it& but I thought it was expensive for what it is."
12596,3928,5," Grandson loves it"
12597,3929,4," Take your time to master the kite and you will be amazed how much fun you and your family will have . From beginner to experienced flyer& hours of fun can be had by all. Dont run before you can walk though. These kites are quite powerful so take care when in the hands of young children."
12598,3929,5," Flys well for a small kite."
12599,3930,4," a good start to get children interested in gardening"
12600,3930,5," Good"
12601,3931,5," Very pleased with this realistic toy. My grandson was thrilled with it.Played with this all xmas. He was a very happy two year old."
12602,3931,5," Unique and something as a keep saver also for ur little one to enjoy hours of play time."
12603,3932,5," Very easy to fly and get up into the air. Easy to control once in the sky and doesn't need strong wind to fly. stands out when flying because of bright colours."
12604,3932,5," This is the first kite that I've purchased for my son and it's beautiful. It looks beautiful and it flies great. Trivial to assemble and super easy to get it up in the air.I highly recommend this kite if you are looking for a simple easy kite."
12605,3932,5," The main thing is that it kept the kids happy on the beach& extremely sturdy and catches the wind well!"
12606,3932,5," Really happy with the kite.Very easy to assemble and even easier to fly.Did however manage to get it stuck up in a treee after about 30mins of flying so off to amazon to buy another one!!"
12607,3932,3," but only 1 controller so has a tendency to veer off and once you lose control its very hard to regain it."
12608,3932,5," Perfect present for a small girl.  Very robust& which it needed to be on the windy day we first used it.  It was certainly stronger than the rated windspeeds advised in the instructions& but although it crashed a few times& no damage was done.  Really good materials and as a result a happy granddaughter!"
12609,3932,5," Not had much success with kites in the past so a little reluctant to buy one for my 8 year old grandson. However went for it and what a great success. After a few minutes in a moderate breeze he had the kite flying and it looked great in the air. At this price you can't o wrong."
12610,3932,5," Flies in very low wind. Well made. Reasonably stable - though does dive about if the wind is not constant - which the 11 year owner thinks is hilarious.  Looks fantastic especially the long knobbly knees and legs."
12611,3933,4," The handle broke on my monitor speaker which made it a bit awkward - the monitor is about 15kg.Just required one of these handles - does the job perfectly. Even looks a bit funky with the red handle against the black casing."
12612,3933,5," Great handles& we have these on our kids out door play house and they are very good& lasting well with no signs of wear even 16 months after installing. Great value."
12613,3933,5," Strong and sturdy"
12614,3934,5," The Big Bang Rocket is an excellent toy for all ages& my kids 11& 9 and 4 all enjoy playing with it.It is very easy to use& but my 4 year old needs help to open the end to put the paper in.My advice is to tear a stock of paper in advance for easy loading in between each go. It gives a very satisfying BANG as it lands& made even more pleasing by the fact that it isn't caused by any form of explosive!We've had to recover it from the roof once when my 11year got a little exuberant with his throw& but he soon learned that you don't have to throw it that high. It doesn't work in pouring rain because the paper goes soggy - but who would be daft enough to try?!"
12615,3934,4," Amazing how much noise this simple thing can make.  Great that you don't have to buy caps or refills or it just consumes newspaper!  Very simple and effective.  My son has loved creeping up behind people and scaring them with the loud noise.  The top cap is a little flimsy and soon became detached& but the rocket is still usable.  Good old fashioned fun."
12616,3934,4," It just takes a small piece of newspaper  to make a big bang& in our game we compete for the loudest bang. You do need a bit of space and  a flat surface for the rocket to land on but other than that its easy to play with."
12617,3934,5," this little gem had a good write up so I got one for the grandchildren to play with when they visit and they haven't got fed up with it yet.!"
12618,3934,5," The kids love it and the wood Pigeons hate it& so I use it every day to scare them off. We are now a no fly zone for these monsters."
12619,3935,5," Saw in France& hunted down in UK. Darts work well& sticking every time. Little difficult to target accurately& but a laugh."
12620,3936,5," Fantastic kite& so easy it literally flies itself! This kite is big and has a quite a pull in the wind my 11 year old daughter can handle it but i wouldn't recommend it for a younger child as it would take them off their feet :)"
12621,3936,5," Straight up and away and one very happy nephew& first rate&  i thoroughly recommended &A1 kite& just hold on tight."
12622,3936,5," Superb product would recommend to any one wanting to buy"
12623,3936,5," It is purple not pink! Fantastic kite. Best we've had. Very easy to fly. Very stable - does not dive bomb. Does not require high winds - a breeze is enough. Mesmerising to watch. Handy pack away bag. Think many orders will be placed after our beach visit this afternoon. The other one in the photo is also from amazon and was great too."
12624,3936,5," Great kite& bought as a gift but I've flown it myself. Flies well with little wind& on a good day you can get the kite up and leave it there all day. As a side note you can quite easily attach a go pro camera to this& great fun!"
12625,3936,3," Looks stunning when it flies but I think we got a flaky one - kept dive-bombing even in steady winds (we were simultaneously flying a different kite which stayed steady as a rock). Going to need some tweaking of string lengths if we are to get it to behave. Had hoped for one which would not require this (especially as it is a single-string kite which you cannot trim)."
12626,3936,5," Can't rate this highly enough. Flew this all summer on the Isle of Wight. Stunning looking& easy to fly& unpack& put away etc. Everyone on the beach stopped to watch. Lovely bag to keep it in too. Best kite we've ever had. Really& I could rave about it all day. Purple octopus - we love you!"
12627,3936,5," Fantastic kite for the kids. Its huge and flies really easy& even in the lightest breeze. Packs into the small bag provided easy too. No fiddling about& just attach the string and away you go. Also bought the stomp rocket too. Another great gift"
12628,3937,5," Came very well wrapped and extremely quickly. Was very happy with everything and will definitely be being from this company again."
12629,3938,5," Super speedy delivery and exactly as described. A great first time kite that was really easy to set up and use. Lots of fun had by all even the 3.5yr old who liked to help hold the handles!"
12630,3938,5," Wow how easy is can they make this kite to set up !. All I had to do was attach the main flight strings via a larch knot (a simple loop) and then send it up. Packs down the same way& back into the handy bag it came in. The kite will be easy to store answer in the bot with out taking up much more space than a very small fold up kite would do.Brought for my daughters birthday. She is a small 8yo and flew this with no hassles at all. The day we tested was a 7-8mph wind and she kept control at all times.Would I recommend this ? Yes without any shadow of a doubt for a kid& for an adult it's still loads of fun but a larger kite would naturally give you a bit more of a fight. For the cost it is& just buy one to keep in your boot& the first time you use it you won't regret it."
12631,3938,3," took out within an hour of receiving.. VERY WINDY && i thought this will be fun.... easy to set up.... one tug on the lines and up it went.. then folded in on itself... tried again but walked backwards.. got a massive blast of wind and spent 25 mins spinning& diving& hovering.. as soon as the strong wind died down.. collapsed in on itself again... couldn't get it to fly again afterwards.. just wouldnt take offI may go for a 3m but another brand/make... didnt seem to pocket the air very well when up unless i put tension on the strings... ended up walking an acre of field backwards to keep it up for that 25 mins...nice effort for the price."
12632,3938,3," NOT EASY TO FLY! My husband has flown a few kites and struggled with this. It was really hard to keep in the sky and then the strings got really tangled.We were on the beach in Norfolk on a windy day with lots of other kits fliers so it wasn't the conditions. Cheaper kites have flown a lot better in the past."
12633,3938,4," A nice kite but a little tricky to master if you are new to kiting"
12634,3938,5," Can't ask for more for Â£20. Fantastic kite- good quality ripstop. As others have mentioned it really needs a helper as the lines are quite long and it was hard to self launch. It did pop up a few times by itself with a little run a couple of times.This thing really flies well! It also has decent pull and turns like an angry wasp! Buzzing it across the window is great fun! The rainbow colour scheme works really well if you attach the red handle to the red side of the kite- when the lines cross you can right it as long as you pull the correct side."
12635,3938,5," Took this kite out on the day it arrived& and wow! It's great. It's flies brilliantly& very easy to handle& you're doing tricks very quickly and the power is incredible& compared to a kid's kite at least! My kids both had a go too& 7 year old could fly it very easily& 5 year old needed help because of the power of it. It's called a beach kite& as Londoners& there aren't many beaches and it flies just as well on a National Trust field! Was worried that beach meant that it needed even wind buy it's happy with nearby trees disrupting the wind flow."
12636,3938,5," Really can't speak highly enough of this kite. Set up is minimal and easy to launch. Stable enough to get started but dynamc enough to have some fun with.  Have used for several days on the beach and it hit the beach hard plenty of times. 90 % of the time it will launch again with just a tug on the lines and it never sustained any damage. Only intervention was to straighten out the harness and empty some sand out a few times - much easier than mending struts..."
12637,3939,5," Just as it looks"
12638,3940,1," bought a couple of months ago.  Looked for a straight forward simple kite for the grandchildren.looking to just let it go and up it goes  !!  Still trying to get it off the ground.Also bought mini flyers dog and cat& had same end results.Kite size is what I expected but it just will not fly.  It has such a long tail on it. And seems to be too long and therefore a little heavy for such a small kite."
12639,3940,5," Perfect addition to the Weather Box. Small and great for children to copy to make their own ! very cheap too."
12640,3940,5," When I read mini I didn't quite realise it would be so mini but all in all its such fun to play with!"
12641,3940,3," Flew in strong winds and very difficult to keep up even for a grown up. Not sure how it would fly in moderate winds.3 yr old soon got bored& picking it up."
12642,3940,5," fun little toy for one or two uses. The kids loved it and were playing for hours. it's quite fun and a lot easier to handle than an actual big kite! :)"
12643,3941,4," No fixing instructions. Long screw needs to go through wheel and into wood. This is tricky to tighten up as you are working in a tight space and socket spanner too thick. Screw came through the wood on play frame and had to cover with compound for safety. Once fixed in place children enjoyed play."
12644,3941,5," I bought this for my sons pirate birthday party and screwed it to the decking& kids loved it and was a great success. Good sturdy product& I'm sure it'll get lots of use. Arrived quickly and well packaged."
12645,3941,5," This product is exactly as it looks in the photo.Its strong and well made with good quality plastic& and fittings are supplied.Now all we need is a boat."
12646,3941,5," these steering wheels are billiant.  have built a pirate ship in the garden and attached these they are fantastic  thanks"
12647,3941,5," Great little accessory& we've used this on an outdoor play house and it is lasting well."
12648,3942,5," Simple fun and loud. Especially at night. We used white A4 paper which sounded best and the lights at night are well cool"
12649,3942,5," Most toys disappoint.  This one didn't.  Good fun so we all had  a few laughs.  Entertained all the kids& from a 4 year old to one over 40."
12650,3942,5," This Big Bang rocket is great fun for the grandchildren& for the adults it also acts as a good way to frighten theWoodpigeons away ."
12651,3942,5," Great fun& but limited by weather and time of year."
12652,3942,2," Great fun... used twice.... throw it high in the air... listen in awe as it goes phut in next door but ones garden.... get it back... throw it high in the air...gasp in amazement as it goes phut on the flat roof... put it away.  Now we could take it to the park but I just don't think my kids.. 11 and 13 are that into it."
12653,3943,3," It doesn't make any noise. My son doesn't have any problems pushing it through our grass while pretending to mow. Because it's 100% plastic& he can wash it without ruining any parts. We've actually had this for two summers now& and we might get a third out of it before he gets too tall."
12654,3943,1," This toy is a total waste of money! It is cheap and nasty and fell apart in 2 weeks! The wheel snapped off first& then the top unit. Buy a lawn mower that's twice the price instead or you'll end up having to spend more on replacing this useless toy."
12655,3943,1," Looks great and makes a loud |lawnmower| noise but there is nothing to stop the handle going forward over the top of the mower when being pushed. My 18 month old grandson had a nasty fall when he pushed it forward and fell over the top! Too dangerous to use. Review doesn't give me the option to give NO stars."
12656,3943,5," I got it for my friends son for he birthday and he loves it he wont put it down am so glad i got it now"
12657,3943,3," The handle flips forward very easily sending the child flying.  It also has a clicker noise which gets annoying very quickly."
12658,3943,5," My son loves helping me cut the grass with this. He pretends he cutting it with me which is great& and we've had many great photos that will be a great memory for when he is older. The build quality is good& and can see this lasting for years."
12659,3943,5," These little mowers are great for toddlers.  they make a clicking sound as they are pushed along and my son loves mowing the grass next to his dad.  Great buy"
12660,3943,4," For the price excellent.  Noisy but the kids love them.  Ordered two but were delivered on separate days."
12661,3944,5," Got this for my 6 yr old nephew. He absolutely loves it"
12662,3945,3," Fast delivery& could have been better packaged it was a bit flimsy.Not very substantial but well received by small boy. Crayons were a bit thin for small hands to grasp."
12663,3945,5," Great Product for kids.  They love the idea of being able to decorate the kite themselves to personalise it.  Flies well& even in low wind"
12664,3945,5," Great craft for them rainy days an work great"
12665,3946,4," The kite was beuatifully made and flies well. It was very easy to assemble. It is delicate and requires an adult to look after it and take responsibility for it. I would recommend it - it looks great in the air."
12666,3946,5," Flies very well& spins and twirls nicely. Looks fantastic against gray or suny sky.Children should wear glowes as the string can burn the skin in strong winds. Be aware of barking dogs :] Guaranteed fun for everyone! I love it and I'm 29."
12667,3946,4," Went to the local park on a windy day (lots of them around at the moment!) Had a few adjustments to make to the various strings and then up she went!! Great fun& great way to bond with the kids. Everyone should get a kite& bring out the child in you."
12668,3946,5," A really fun present bought for a 7 year old who was very excited to receive it and even more excited to fly when the weather was a bit better."

12670,3947,5," Very good value for your money Best Buy"
12671,3948,5," I wanted a first kite for my 2 year old. I already knew box kites were really stable and fly in light winds. This one is very colourful and very easy to launch and fly. It will stay up forever when other single line kites nose dive and crash. My son loved it. It is easy to puncture the fabric when assembling the diagonal spars. I did this with one spar when I first assembled it but have been more careful since. There is just a small puncture in the fabric which isn't noticable and doesn't affect the flying. It also has not got worse despite being also flown in high winds. A very nice kite."
12672,3948,5," I got this kite to fly alongside my Daughters Diamond Rainbow. We've had it for about a week now but the wind just hasn't been blowing till yesterday& so we all went to try it out. I was expecting to need help getting it into the air but found that all I needed to do was let it go and it rose immediately.The construction of the kite looks and feels very good& everything is tight and solid. seems as though it would be able to handle quite a few fast crashes before anything broke.Assembly was easy as it's just a case of fixing the four cross beams inside into the rubber mounts. care does have to be taken when doing this though as the 2nd beam at each end needs to be bent to get it into the mount so it would be easy to slip and puncture the canvas.Once done though all that's needed is to tie the string on and wait for a windy day. the string has plenty on it too& the picture I've uploaded has the string unwound about halfway.Overall a fun& easy to fly& well made kite that can be launched by one person."
12673,3948,3," Item came well packaged and within the time stated.  I read with interest one of the reviews for this particular item from a lady who stated that when putting the item together she inadvertently put a small hole in the sale area from one of the cross members that hold the kite taut.  I now see the reason why this happened. This is because the cross member spars as mentioned are certainly too long and one has to struggle to put them in place without having to bend them in.  I found in my case that I had to alter the length of the  spars by as much as 1cm to get them sit properly without seeing a bend within the cross structure.  I know that it is not probably critical as kites go and I have since flown the kite and found it to be a great flyer& however& I did have to alter the said spars which was not easy to do as they are made of carbon fibre and have to be cut with a junior hacksaw carefully to prevent splitting.  Unless the manufacturer alters the spec. slightly others may have the same difficulty when assembling."
12674,3948,5," I flew this kite for the first time the other day and was very happy with it.  Initially the wind was *very* low (barely blowing at all)& which meant that even running around the kite wouldn't stay aloft.  However once the wind picked up a fraction the kite went aloft with barely any effort."
12675,3948,5," Got this kite for a bit of fun& most kites to-day are the standard 'stunt' type kites. Thought it would be a laugh to fly an old style box kite as I did as a kid in the 60's. (Grandkids loved it) Kite appears to be well made"
12676,3948,5," Have assembled it& but not yet flown& owing to lack of suitable weather. The kite is exactly as described. Very light& so should be suitable for light winds. The cross-braces are a tight fit into their grommets& so I filed the ends a little to make them more rounded. The cross-braces are slender& and therefore flexible& and when fitted in place become curved by the tension. Some reviewers have suggested shortening the cross-braces a little -this would probably lessen their tendency to bend& but would also reduce the pressure needed to keep the box shape square. I shall leave their lengths as supplied for the time being& and re-assess after having flown the kite."
12677,3948,5," Went on a hill  about half a mile from my father in law's house with my family. When the wind was strong enough it went up. It needs a bit stronger wind than other kites to fly. It went soaring upwards and it was easy to handle. It was one of the easiest kites to handle and I have now about 10 in my collection. It went up about 150m up and first door neighbors said they saw it from half a mile away. It would go even higher but I saw a light aircraft flying so I lowered it down. All in all one of the best buys. Just needs moderate wind and off it goes."
12678,3948,5," Barged the kids out of the way and flew it myself :)  The small ones had fun trying to stay on the ground"
12679,3949,5," So easy it almost flies itself. The kite is easily assembled by putting a plastic rod in across the spans& tie on the tail and it's that easy. It flies so easy that you can tie it to something and let it fly on its own once it's up.It was thrown into the toy box with lots of other bits and pieces and it came out like new. Very strong and well made to withstand rough handling.An easy choice if you are looking for an easy to fly strong kite& and nice colours too!"
12680,3949,5," It's a little beauty !!  Only small& but so is my 3 year old grand daughter..  she absolutely loves it.  It flies easily and loves being up in the air.  There are two attach points for the string&  we found that the lower one gives much better results.  Would definitely buy the same again and might do for presents for other kids.  Inexpensive& great quality& flies like a dream&  Recommended.."
12681,3949,5," very easy to use& sturdy construction and a good size for my 4 year old"
12682,3950,5," Arrived on time& Great kite& very quick in flight and responsive. Turns very quickly and easy to set up. Lots of fun& definitely recommend."
12683,3951,5," Oldest grand son loves it &Best way to keep him occupied and out in the fresh air."
12684,3951,5," Great fun flies really well& thank you ."
12685,3951,5," Heaven its just the best fun ever :)"
12686,3952,5," Great kite& sturdy and easy to use. Had a great fun afternoon with the kids."
12687,3953,5," I have already reviewed the matching garden fork from this range. I bought this Bug Trowel at the same time as the Bug Fork to give to my 4 year old niece who enjoys helping Mummy in the garden at home and also helping Grandad in his garden. Melissa"
12688,3953,5," I brought this as a joke present for by landscape gardener BF...Looks good& is sturdy and made of metal. Very cute. I am sure a keen child would love it for the garden."
12689,3953,5," To go with the fork& just for fun"
12690,3953,5," Excellent quality."
12691,3954,5," I bought this as a gift for a friend and we have spent the afternoon flying it.I have flown delta type rigid stunt kites for many years and I found this kite to handle as well as mine. The principle difference being the lack of poles& which make this much more crash proof!It does all the same types of stunts including tight loops and will fly in far lighter winds than my rigid kites.One thing worth noting that is not mentioned in the instructions: There is a little loop of string on the trailing edge& right in the middle. This serves two purposes. The first is to stow the two knotted ends on the kite where you would attach the lines for flight. This allows you to fold away the kite without the worry of tangled rigging. The second is to attach a really long polyester tube tail and make your stunts look even better!Before flying or gifting this kite I stowed the lines as mentioned above (they come attached to a piece of card& when new). I also unwound the flight lines off the plastic retainer (these are wound as a pair). Then I detached them from the handle straps& separated them& and rewound them individually& one after the other& back on to the handle. This makes the kite more ready to fly& out of the bag& as it is easier to lay the lines one at a time. The lines will otherwise possibly become very tangled on first deployment. Some reviewers on here have had this problem with much frustration it appears. (most new kites have line wound in this fashion& as the lines are in pairs of equal length)This is a superb kite for a nice price. I will be buying more of these as gifts. A bit of preparation prior to wrapping this up will ensure it will deploy and perform out of the bag on it's first flight."
12692,3954,5," Bought this kite after reading the reviews on here. I am really pleased with it& took it on holiday and flew it on the beach. My 10 year old son also flew it and he found it quite easy to fly. I would recommend this kite anyone who is looking to buy their first parafoil kite."
12693,3954,5," This is the first kite I have owned and I have to say I loved it. I slammed it into the ground loads of times (as I am a novice) but it was fine. I once used a kite with solid struts& but that just hit the ground once and broke. This one does not do that as there are no solid parts. There is a little vibration when in high wind& but to be honest you will love it as a fun kite for yourself and the children. I will keep this little baby in the car for fun times out. If you have never owned a kite then buy this one. For the money it IS WELL WORTH BUYING!!! I now want a bigger one to see if I can get lifted off the ground!. Happy flying."
12694,3954,5," Two kids just loved it& aged 8 and 10.  Sturdy and nicely built.  Flew well in a light to moderate breeze."
12695,3954,5," the product arrived on time.The kite was as described.An excellent product.I would recommend this product to anyone considering an entry level kite."
12696,3954,5," Bought this for a holiday and had a great time with it. Easy to use& small and light when packed away"
12697,3954,4," Nothing wrong with the kit& but you might want to get separate string holders. Most kites come with each strong on its own holster& this kit both strings are on the same one& which can cause problems when opening it up."
12698,3954,4," The Symphony appears to be well made and packs into it`s compact case with lines.On the first few flights it was difficult to keep the kite in the air as it was only a light wind day and I was not used to the controls!I went out on a light to moderate wind day&I managed to fly for quite a while and I managed to get used to the controls and do some stunts.Recently I flew on the back end of a storm with moderate to strong winds&the kite performed well and was really fast&you needed quick reactions to stop it flying into the ground.It hit the ground on a couple of occasions but does not appear to be damaged.It even started to pull me forwards in the stronger winds.When the wind got really strong I had a couple of line breakages&which I managed to tie up with a knot.This is the only complaint I have about the kite.I think that the lines will have to be changed to stronger ones&but will have to watch the weight of the line as it can affect performance.All in all this is a fun kite to fly&setting up is easy as you just loop the lines over a knot on the kite lines and it`s ready to fly.It is an easy way to just walk across to the nearby fields and have a lot of fun!I would have awarded it 5 stars&but with the problem of line breakage I will award it 4.I am sure this problem will be rectified with stronger lines?"
12699,3955,4," Bought as a birthday present for my brother& he loves it and they seem to be quite high quality& good toy."
12700,3956,3," I bought this parachute for my new youth group in January"
12701,3956,3," this was bought for our gym tots group to replace the old one & it was the cheapest on amazon and anywhere i looked & but it also feel cheap in construction & its not the soft parachute material our last one was this is nylon crinkle material & which honestly feels like it might rip any moment at the seems ( so far it hasnt but im not willing to bet that it wont ? )....the kids adore using the parachute and untill we can afford a better one ( or untill this one breaks ) it will do"
12702,3956,3," super fun& kids loved it& a little small& good for a group of 6-8 5 to 6 year olds... but the handles are feeble& two of them tore away almost immediately."
12703,3956,4," this is a good product for the price- it's bid enough for around 8 toddlers and my children love it. it isnt as durable as the ones ive used before and possibly wouldnt hold out for daily or rigorous use& but its great for domestic use and parties!"
12704,3956,5," We need a small parashute for our Toddlers to use in the church hall and this is excellent! Just right."
12705,3956,4," The parachute is well-made& and suitable for use with a small group of young children.  It would have been good to have some ideas for games included."
12706,3956,5," Tough enough for 10 three year old boys to pull and play with at a party. Good packaging with it too!"
12707,3956,3," not sure about this one yet& my one year old was not to interested but i think he will get into it as he gets older or maybe he just wasnt in the mood when he first played with it. otherwise& it was fast delivery and it is massive& although i dont understand the price tag& seems a bit expensive for what it is....."
12708,3957,5," I got this for my friends daughter as when she comes to see me she always wants to help me in the garden. The tools are well made and a good size for small hands though as she is only three the gloves were too big but she'll grow into them!"
12709,3957,5," I bought two of these& one for my 5 year old niece and one for my 6 year old god daughter.  They both love it and wanted to buy some seeds straight away to get planting! I was worried about the gloves being big enough as it doesn't state in the information what size they are& but they are plenty big enough for this age group and if anything they are a little on the large side so will continue to fit for some time.  I would recommend this to anyone with a child this age to buy for& it was one of my most successful and well received presents!"
12710,3957,5," Very pretty and handy for young gardeners the only problem bring the pegs lose their insects as the glue isn't strong enough"
12711,3957,5," Thank you so much&My daughter having just aquired her first allotment and her aim being to involve her 3yr old daughter where over the moon with the garden tools&Athena my grandaughter has not put then down for a moment&we just cant keep her out the garden&chuffed to bits thank you.we will recommend this to her play group."
12712,3957,5," Very nice little gardening set for kids& well made with the essentials and space to add some parts if needed& you get Gloves& Trowel& Shovel and Border markers. There's space to add parts if needed but it has everything they will need to help out and get started into their gardening or allotment endeavors!"
12713,3957,4," Smaller then i thaught it would bBut little girl loves itArrived too days bfor due date and packaged well.&Lovely coloures and just as pitcher. Fork and shovel made well can stand some nocking about the gloves are also nice and made well maybe fit ages 3-7 x would reccomend to buy"
12714,3957,5," This is a great set for little gardeners& my little girl loved it. The gloves are small enough to fit my 2 and a half year old with a bit of room for growth and the tools are metal with wooden handle so are very tough.An excellent product."
12715,3957,5," I bought this for my grand daughter who is nearly 4.  She was thrilled by it& and so was I.  The little bag is cute and the tools are robust and well made. The gloves were a bit too big but she will grow into them no problem.  A very good gift."
12716,3958,5," Ideal for first time fliers. Let ALL of the string out before flying and it soars away. great fun and looks super."
12717,3958,5," Great& we used it this weekend on the beach with our Granddaughter& and she loved it"
12718,3958,5," After a few minutes of unsuccessful flight& I worked out that the 'pockets' in the wings were not pushed through the right way. Once 'fixed& the kite went straight up to the limit of its string. Easy to fly& even for a five year old girl."
12719,3958,4," Both my boys and their dad love this kite. It looks great is easy to open and fold and can be handled by a 3"
12720,3958,5," This kite is fantastic& so easy to fly& my 4 year old daughter loves it& and can't wait to take it out again and again!Despite being a very light kite& it flew in some strong winds& and has not fallen apart& appears quite robust."
12721,3958,1," Disappointed. I am not sure if something was wrong with the kite but every time it launched in dive bombed to the right hitting the ground. We tried to make sure everything was straight& we tried different line lengths& we even tried different days. Nothing worked. Eventually the top of the kite broke continually smashing into the ground. So as I said disappointed& considering the other positive experiences most others seem to have had. Order was good though and speedily dispatched."
12722,3958,5," I originally bought one of these kites and it had a bent frame& and as a result didn't work at all.  I was really impressed with the customer services who contacted me to say that they were going to send a replacement at no extra cost.  I hadn't even requested this so it was a welcome surprise& added to which& the replacement kite worked a treat! Most importantly our little boy loves it and it looks great!  Well worth the money."
12723,3958,5," The first time I took my daughter kite flying with this& she garnered a small (in both senses) audience within minutes. It's small and light& but sturdy enough for a reasonable amount of being dragged over the grass. Its relatively small surface area to weight ration means you do need a steady wind or you'll do a lot of running around& but I could not recommend it highly enough as a first time kite for a 3-4 year old."
12724,3959,5," Needed something that compacts down for storage asthis purchase was for scouts and flying the 'jack'Solid materials - great design - really recommend this product."
12725,3959,5," Works well& Have now bought two of these& one either side of the front door. At the right time one will fly the Chelsea flag& and the other the Manchester United flag."
12726,3959,5," Great flagpole. Easy to put together and to install on the wall outside. I coated mine in 3 layers of yacht varnish before putting it up seeing as i do live in England! My St Georges flag waves beautifully in the wind without a care in the world& and is a huge warm welcome to all the immigrants :P"
12727,3959,4," Does what it's supposed to. I really bought it just for the mount. Good quality item though and recommended for the price."
12728,3959,5," Easy to fit&fast delivery and looks amazing now I put my England flag up& await nfl season to put my 12th man flag up!!"
12729,3959,3," I had to reorder as original never turned up& once received the screws were of poor quality but the rest was fine."
12730,3959,5," Great for the job I wanted it to do fixed to the tiller of my narrowboat"
12731,3959,4," the directions were  not particularly clear but that was overcome."
12732,3960,4," This Kite is excellent fun as it is large but easy to fly.  The parrot is very colourful and the kite itself is very durable."
12733,3961,5," We bought this for our 11 year old for his birthday and now all his friends want one. It's easy to use& and really does fire the balloons a long way. His Dad was also firing packets of sweets for the kids to catch& which was a great game. Very robust& and the carry bag is handy too. The only thing I'd suggest is getting an adapter to fill the water balloons. Definitely recommend& and would buy for friends&"
12734,3961,4," Ordered 5 of these for a scout event later this year. Of course I had to try it myself first. Great fun& I was suprised how far / high you can launch the water bombs. Looking forward to seeing the youngsters knocking targets out of trees& I'm sure they won't intentionally aim for the leaders!"
12735,3961,5," Great item& hilarious game to play! I would say it's for children 10 and above as you need to be fairly strong to use it! Very quick delivery and it comes with balloons and it's own little carry bag!"
12736,3961,4," Pretty robust.  Have seen stitching come undone on others but it doesn't prevent usage and it's probably due to an adult over stretching it.  This hasn't happened with mine."
12737,3961,5," It was a winner when we played with it while camping with the kids.  And since then I've bought it for 3 friends who've also loved it!  Best summer game ever!"
12738,3961,5," Best fun when sunny...get a team together and watch the carnage...guaranteed soaking& although don't get to close together because it's a powerful weapon :)"
12739,3961,5," One happy little boy!He was very impressed with this product and cannot wait for some decent weather to get outside and enjoy terrorising the neighbourhood."
12740,3961,4," Its a good strong catapult  and the water balloons that came with it were really durable and burst when they was supposed to& lots of fun and good quality."
12741,3962,4," Good value for money. Brought for my son& easy to assemble"
12742,3962,5," Long ago I bought a kite with two lines& the sort you can do acrobatics with& I then spent two hours watching my kite crash again and again on the ground like a kamikaze aeroplane& each time spending approximately three seconds in the air. Very frustrating. Along comes Brookite Shadow Kite& you do need a minimum of breeze to get it in the air but once it is up there you could almost peg the line in the ground and go away for an ice cream& it will stay up for ages with a very nice long moving tail. The components are basic but sturdy& an adult might be required to correctly decipher the instructions diagrams regarding where to tie the line to the kite but not too difficult. I would definitely recommend to anybody who was interested in taking up kite flying as a hobby& you will be most rewarded."
12743,3962,5," Lovely bright kite. Fly's well. Simple assembly. Excellent price and great quality.The kids love it.Great fun all round."
12744,3962,5," Not used it yet but as I have purchased similar one previously I am sure this will be just as good easy to get it up and flying ideal for young three grandsons aged between six and twelve years& quick delivery too just waiting for chance to fly it now will be taking kites with us when we go camping."
12745,3962,5," I bought this kite as a present for my grandson back in January. Never been the right weather till last weekend in Blackpool on the beach .  Wow it was brilliant it soared immediately to a great height and stayed and danced and twirlled& A great kite  looked amazing on the skyline ."
12746,3962,4," I got this for my 3 year old to fly as the one we had we couldn't get going. This is a really good kite and easy to fly and assemble. One star knocked off because the one we had has a little plastic bag thing to keep it in so you can carry it about and store it better."
12747,3962,5," Very easy to assemble. Two poles to attach then the main string to tie on. It's a good size& really brightly coloured and the ribbons are really long.By the time we reached the park we'd ended up with pretty heavy rain and strong winds. Not deterred we took our kite out anyway. It still flew like a dream.Our children are 7 and 4 and they managed to launch and fly it all by themselves.We were out for 40minutes before the rain sent us home.The kite stood up really well to the weather.Fantastic first kite& easy to fly and for a great price. I'd highly recommend it."
12748,3962,5," My son (7) was very pleased with this& he put it together and it flew well. Better than the cheap one we had before which was bought in the high street. It has a single line so it entertains for only a limited time. Seems robust"
12749,3963,5," Not a toy for ever& but a lot of fun :-)"
12750,3963,5," Grandson loved it"
12751,3964,5," After a few minutes of unsuccessful flight& I worked out that the 'pockets' in the wings were not pushed through the right way. Once 'fixed& the kite went straight up to the limit of its string. Easy to fly& even for a three year old girl."
12752,3964,1," A big disappointment. Tried many times with my daughter but we could not manage to fly it. As soon as it goes in the sky it plunges."
12753,3964,5," Was a present for my grandson to take on holiday. They told me they had loads of fun with it and spent hours flying it."
12754,3964,5," Great Kite - excellent value for money!  We have twin grandsons and this kite plus the Lady Bug Kite are perfect."
12755,3965,5," great kite a great purchase"
12756,3966,5," Great kit. A 2l bottle launches at about 3 bar and& when quarter filled& went up 18-24 ft. On descent& it tumbles fairly harmlessly. Take off angle is pretty variable- even with the little stand provided. Parts are sufficiently robust to last multiple launches. You do need a fair bit of space and I think a track pump (bike pump that you stand on and plunge up and down) is essential as it gives you a bit more distance.My son loves it and has learnt loads about the physics through playing."
12757,3966,5," Amazing. My nephew loved this& it brought some awesome childhood memories back for me also& think I enjoyed it as mich.  Warning& use in a large open space& this thing goes a long way!!"
12758,3966,5," Great fun& I found that less water is better and a make sure you stand back as it goes off like a rocket quite literally. Kids loved it"
12759,3967,5," I like this for the simple fact is is nicely made& colourful and fun for any little bug hunter.  My son has expressed a real interest in all things bug-like and I thought this would keep him entertained in the garden when the warmer weather arrives.  Given the number of programs on children's TV teaching kids to love bugs& this will be an essential piece of kit for pre-schoolers to collect the odd ladybird or crawly thing.  Or he might just stuff it full of leaves.  It's small enough for your little one to walk around with and pretend anyhow."
12760,3967,5," absolutely brilliant for trips to the pond with children for catching those creepy crawlies. would recommend this product for the summer"
12761,3967,4," ggod"
12762,3968,5," Dads: Stuck inside on Christmas Day& tubes not running& no shops& no entertainment& no sign of life? Here is the answer to your Christmas prayers& and the kids will love it too.The Stomp Rocket is an absurdly simply concept - there's really nothing to it& the only wonder is no one's ever thought of it before.Is it educational? Sure - and how: If given the benefit of the full& concentrated force of father's 17 stone frame travelling downwards with gravity (accelerating at 10m/s2& so well worth experimenting by standing on chairs& ladders& launching from trampolines etc.)& these little plastic rockets really will go MILES in the air and will (wind permitting) prescribe a perfect parabola& and the rocket flites are rifled& ensuring the cylinder rotates aerodynamically and thus attains greater distance and accuracy. There"
12763,3968,5," We bought the original version of this for some Easter fun and then promptly forgot to take it on holiday& so got the junior version as a next day delivery instead.  When we got home we compared the two versions (I've reviewed the junior glow version as well).  The only difference between the two versions are the rockets.  The latest version of the original version has a different tube to the picture shown.Assembly is very easy.  The 3 plastic legs make up the base and you put a bolt and wing nut through the launch pipe to connect it to the base.  It needs a little bit of tape if you want to keep it vertical - but you may not want to anyway!Once the unit is assembled& simply put a rocket on the launch pipe and stamp on the launch pad (a plastic squashable box).  The original rockets fire about 300 feet upwards with an adult stamp& and for us our 2 year old managed about half that in the end.  I have no idea why this is rated 6 plus - I expect the rockets need care because they are plastic and if fired into the face it would seriously hurt.  So adult supervision needed!Indoor use is not possible - the rockets are too hard.  Buy a junior glow refill pack if you want indoor use.So simple& and hours of fun for all ages.Note that the junior version of this has an identical launch pad (we bought both)."
12764,3968,5," Really easy to set and great fun& at a great price. My daughter and I had a right laugh on the beach with this rocket. It really does go pretty high! This will keep the kids [and me] entertained for a long time to come. Buy one."
12765,3968,5," This toy is absolutley excellent& you can fire the rockets up to 300 feet!! It is my kids favourite outdoor game (until they have to get the rockets back!) Great toy for a great price& a must have for parents with kids!!! Recommended AAA***"
12766,3968,3," My 2 have really enjoyed playing with this and have spent many an afternoon outside with it (I enjoyed less having to retrieve rockets off the roof& out of tree's& neighbour's gardens etc...).  You 'stomp' on an airfilled bladder which shoots the rocket up quite some distance.  The harder you stomp the higher it goes.  The launch mechanism allows you to set the angle the rocket flys at.  The rockets are very light (lightweight plastic cylinder with a rubbery nose) and so won't break regular windows but could hurt people or do damage to a greenhouse!  After a while (several months of being left outdoors to be precise) the plastic rockets go a bit brittle and break easily."
12767,3968,5," These are so much fun& for adults as well as children& I was amazed how high my son could get it to go. These products are made very well by this manufacturer. And they do everything which is quoted in the product reviews by them."
12768,3968,5," I bought a Stomp Rocket to take to a week long family reunion which involved kids of widely varying ages -  they absolutely loved it and played well together every single day for the whole week with it  -  really great ( often hilarious )  fun and it had them all running around tiring them out for bedtime - my three year old played with his cousins aged from 6 to 9 and even the adults wanted to have a go.  I cannot recommend this highly enough and have just ordered two more as presents.  Be sure you have an open space though as we got the rockets stuck in trees a few times. Physical fun with educational element too as the kids learnt different directions and made up different modes of stomping (eg backwards&  side to middle&  recommend the sitting stomp ! )  I love this."
12769,3969,5," Needed hot air balloons for our travel themed wedding and these were perfect as they are light and did the job :-)"
12770,3969,5," Very good"
12771,3970,5," this is the ultimate dart blaster&it holds 8 darts in the barrel&will shoot any darts even nerf ones&you pull back the cocking mechanisim and blast&i am so happy with this and is one of my faviouroutes!!!"
12772,3970,5," I was hoping my young grand children would enjoy playing with it. They did&apparently it has good darts that fit in their other guns so Gramps ends up with a gun full of multi-coloured darts."
12773,3970,4," Wow... A whole brand new gun at such a bargain price?Love it. As good as any Nerf gun in the same league.Would recommend"
12774,3970,5," Goods arrived as stated. Looks good but it is for a present"
12775,3970,4," Great gun for the cost- lots of fun!"
12776,3970,1," The bullets don't shoot properly"
12777,3971,5," I own several large flexifoil kites and wanted something smaller for my daughter to |grow into| and to take on holiday when luggage allowance limits a bigger kite. I did a lot of research and there are several similar kites by flexifoil (buzz)& ozone and Peter Lynn. As a flexifoil fan my first option was the buzz but the range didn't come recommended by anyone I spoke to. The hq beach symphony is a great little kite but you get what you pay for as some cost has been avoided in the construction (type of line and bridle stitching) this is the pro version and for an extra Â£10 it's a great step up in quality and on par with flexifoil. Kite was easy to set up& easy to fly. I am used to flying 4 line kites but a newbie shouldn't have any trouble if they follow the instructions. A second person to help launch would help to begin with. Comes with a storage bag and is small enough to include in a suitcase or leave in the car. You can fly this on a bar or by with a bar as a trainer kite. Overall very pleased and hate to say it but I wouldn't spend the extra on a flexifoil in this price range"
12778,3971,5," I get a new two-line kite every year. The small HQ kites are by far the best for agile performance of stunts. This one is fast and precise& and very quick to respond. Quite a handful in gusty winds. Definitely a 'pro' and not for the beginner. Newbies would be better advised to start on the HQ 'beach' range."
12779,3972,4," This is a great little rocket set. Easy for little ones to launch the rockets and see them fly. Definitely safe for indoor use as the rockets are made of polystyrene. Couldn't get them to spin or whistle& but still plenty of fun!"
12780,3972,5," 10/10"
12781,3973,5," Read _all_ the instructions& not that there are any on the packaging& nor on the product description for this |version|. But if you look at the other similar products you will note:1) Fold along the two grey lines on each wing (just visible in product photo)& note one line is not quite perpendicular to wing (to give some twist)& doesn't say how much to fold& I did both at 45degrees approx& so the the tips stick out roughly perpendicular to the body. I also saw some photos with more |fold|& they seemed to be folded at the colour block edges& so there were three folds& but these picture don't show any twist which seems wrong to me.2) Switch it on (the LED).Now just launch with the rubber band& avoiding crashing the switch into the launcher is good I think!I've tried one and it works& rest are going in Christmas crackers so will know more about reliability after Christmas.2015-01-02 Update. Turned out they were too big to go in crackers& but they were great fun late Christmas afternoon with ten |adults| and |young adults| messing about in the dark. All the LEDs worked I think& various wings broke& some got lost& some given to the kids next door& generally great value and entertainment. Even managed to use half of them another night."
12782,3973,4," The seller offered me to refund on one of items which lights does not work. I thought that is kind. Nowadays most of sellers do this gesture  for the better review. I hope it may improve their service and try to provide good products.Although this flying helicopter a bit tacky& I can not complain because it is reasonable in terms of the low price and the generous quantity."
12783,3973,3," go on youtube and learn how to bend the wings in the right way to maximise the height& also make sure your a good catcher or have some friends around as once you hit the concrete floor& the lights can stop working& but thats the advatage as you get so much for so cheap. they sell these in tourist spots in europe for about Â£2 each"
12784,3973,5," These are cheap little helicopter slingshots which were massively popular with the tourists in Spain - except instead of paying 5 euros for one you can buy 8 for half the price here!Basically just fold along the lines to make a small helicopter and then fire them up in the air - the elastic will loosen after a few goes and they'll go higher.You can buy bigger and better versions of these from China directly on Aliexpress with proper slingshots but they are more expensive.These are great fun for kids and would make a great addition to a Christmas stocking (although I'll be tempting to put something else in the other half's stocking this Xmas)!!At our Halloween party the adults had as much fun as the children with these!"
12785,3973,5," We took these camping.  It took a bit of practice& but the children absolutely loved them.  They break easily&they are cheap to buy  but are fixable with a bit of cellotape.  Hours and hours of fun in the dark.  The trick is to aim straight up and pull the elastics as tight as you can.  They would be great for bonfire night.  The lights stayed bright for hours and we actually put them in a glass and used it as a lantern."
12786,3973,3," Well they didnt last long as the lights either broke or the blades broke& but gave the boys a few hours of fun."
12787,3973,5," Great item arrive on time"
12788,3973,3," Quality not great ... The hook/band finger broke after using it for two minutes."
12789,3974,5," Having never flown a kite before I finally decided to give it a go and fly this kite with my two children this summer.  I got the kite flying steadily in the air almost instantly.  The string is long enough for me to use and the pull on the line from the kite is gentle enough for my 3 and a half year old to handle safely.  This makes a brilliant first kite and a fun present for children's parties. This really is a brilliant kite to pop in your bag and take just about anywhere."
12790,3974,5," I wanted a first kite for my three-year-old son and this is perfect. It has no dangerous sticks that could injure him& and it folds away easily into a tiny case that can easily be popped into any bag. We managed to fly it with ease on a not-very-windy day& and I've since bought a store of these kites to give as presents."
12791,3974,5," I bought this kite as part of a selection for grandchildren of various ages and althought this was the cheapest (the postage cost more!)it was the easiest to get flying and it flew up& straight and true when i was having trouble with some of the other more expensive and elaborate kites. Highly recommended particularly as it's so convenient to carry round."
12792,3974,4," I bought this as a stocking filler for my 5 year old Daughter. She loves it. It is very small when packed up and has no hard parts except the string winder. It fits in your pocket and when you want it out to fly it& it takes seconds to sort out. It does fly and for a young child its great. We have had some fun with it."
12793,3974,4," This kite works surprisingly well considering it's size.  My 4 and 6 year old love it and can both fly it by themselves.  Excellent value and very portable."
12794,3974,5," Great fun and very easy to fly. When I first tried it it would just spin out of control and it took a little while to realise it was upside down! It lives in the glove box of our car and my four year old daughter was flying it at the beach today. That's why I'm looking at kites this evening because we did have a bit of a fight over who's turn it was so I need my own kite. Would recommend these to anyone& if your out and about it fits in your pocket just in case you decide to have a go and if you don't then at least you've not carried some big cumbersome contraption around with you."
12795,3974,4," Quick delivery and portable size& I carry it often in my bag and believe is a much fun and easy to use. The material is durable however on one occasion the string got tangled quite bad and made it less easy to use. I still would highly recommend it !"
12796,3974,5,""
12797,3975,5," These little fellows just bring a smile to my face every time I see them (currently practicing on my coffee table). I bought a second set for my yoga teacher who LOVES them."
12798,3975,5," Great fun!"
12799,3976,5," Got this beauty last week ready for a trip to the coast this weekend - its my 3rd Flexifoil and they are as excellent as ever.  Good to get this when it was reduced.  I think that this is the biggest Sting so its quite a workout but easy and great fun to fly. It's certainly the biggest one I've got.  If you don't know Flexifoil kites are aerofoil kites - so no spars or struts to break as it's a wing shape and is aerodynamically designed.  The whole thing folds or squashes up into the accompanying rucksack.  Easy to get going and easy to put away and I had mine sorted was flying it within a few minutes.  Its a four line kite so you fly it via handles with two strings per handle (top and bottom).  Means you can do multiple loop the loops and 'fly' the kite across the sky really easily.  Also you can 'collapse' the aerofoil by moving the handles forward (or in fact just letting go!) and the kite just crumples and floats back to earth. With a little practice you can also land it upright and ready to fly again with just a tug on the handles.  My daughters love them too!Great to see this one reduced."
12800,3976,3," Having previously purchased flexifoil kites in the past I expected this to be of the same high standard and on the whole I am happy with the kite and the way it flies but I was a bit disappointed with the cheap feel to the aluminium handles as my other flexifoil kites have has really solid plastic handles with super grippy rubber on them so kinda feel the aluminium ones are a step back although I'm sure they would work fine but I just use my old handles on my new kite& also the kite killers that strap to your wrists are poorer quality than my older ones as well so wasn't impressed by that either! I just feel when paying top money for what should be a top quality product that's exactly what you should get."
12801,3976,4," The kite is fantastic fun and generates decent power even in low winds. The handles provided are& in my opinion& not good enough for the kite and let the overall product down slightly. This was immediately apparent after the first flight out of the box ended badly. I upgraded them to the prolink handles (also from flexifoil) and now I'm a very happy with it. Also worth mentioning& the after sales care from Flexifoil was first class and can't praise them enough for sorting my problem out so quickly and efficiently. If the kite came with the better handles as standard.. 5 stars all day long. Photo is me flying it on the beach in very light winds.. love it!"
12802,3976,5," Firstly the kite came promptly in a well sealed box and once it was unwrapped it was just what i expected from any Flexifoil kite& simply brilliant! really easy to control thanks to its four lines and handles making it safe and really easy to fly& never felt like the kite is out of control even in winds its not really designed for. In addition to its great control this kite is just so much fun!! Me and my girl friend would fly them together and every once in a while we would accidentally crash them in to each other& kites i have had in the past have been damaged by this but these Flexifoil kites come off unscathed and are simply awesome for a bit of fun!"
12803,3976,5," Kite arrived in good time and we'll packaged. I managed to get the lines tangled whilst unpacking but if you follow the instructions (I didn't!) You shouldn't have any problems. Great fun to fly and easy to get the basics if you read the well written guide included. Spent 3 hours out on the first trip ending when a gust of wind made me let go of the handles and the safety system bungee snapped. I emailed flexifoil who sent a new set to me no problems. Excellent quality& outstanding service& great fun!"
12804,3976,5," Got to fly my new kite this weekend. Not my first Flexifoil kite and definitely won't be my last! Its easy to go for cheap kites but these blow them out of the water. Easy to fly& superb build quality& took quite a bashing no problem! Has enough power and control for beginner traction kiting& I have been using it to teach my GF the basics of kiting. Absolutely top notch& thoroughly recommend."
12805,3977,4," Great little kite my 5 year old flew it really high. Only problem was when it crashed the detachable pole flew out. We found it once but not the second tie. Ill buy another and work out how to fix the pole better. Maybe super glue"
12806,3977,5," Havn't opened kite out box yet but hopefully it will be nice"
12807,3978,4," Great just the job"
12808,3979,5," I got the Rainbow colourscheme version of this kite (same kite design& just different colour material) and was saddened to see the |Maybe if your a German| poor review with one star rating. Mine came with quite detailed instructions/diagrams in 4 (four ) languages& the instruction leaflet tucked in a transparent pocket near the top of the kite package& the instructions including wind speed details& dead air zones& safe slowspeed landing zones& etc. Being British& I found it was relatively simple to assemble& is robustly constructed and easy to fly& BUT I can see where the difficulty arises with children being involved if they are not used to sticking at finding out HOW TO by experience. To be fair the warnings on the Amazon info and on the manufacturer info both clearly warn that ADULT SUPERVISION IS REQUIRED. I note another reviewer also saying about the round/ring style of the handles which my purchase also came with"
12809,3979,5," Excellent kite and prompt service"
12810,3979,4," not for children& quite sensitive"
12811,3979,5," very happy."
12812,3979,1," Bought this product as HQ seem to be a popular brand. When it arrived all of the literature have no written instructions and complex diagrams so as my daughter is 10 I had to do it for her. No instructions on how to fly it& there are hand straps in the literature yet the string comes on two round rings and it doesn't even state if these are tied off at the end. It baffles me a kids product (8+) is out there that doesn't even give instruction on how it is to be used. I spent an hour watching two kids get mad and/or cry because it just flew up and crashed down. All in all a terrible buy."
12813,3980,5," We already had a 1.3m kite quite similar to this but my son decided that he'd like a bigger one for his birthday. It's our first kite from HQ and I've been very impressed. It seems very well made& the instructions are clear and easy to understand& (not that you actually need a lot of instruction to use this!)& and it all packs away very neatly into the little pouch that it's supplied in which makes it extremely portable.To use& you simply have to get it out of the pouch& attach the 2 lines and you're off. My 10 year old son quickly got the hang of flying this and has had super fun with it. It doesn't need all that much wind at all and - a word of caution to anyone thinking of buying this for young kids - it does pull pretty hard if there is a decent amount of wind and on one day my son was struggling to maintain his footing and needed a hand to stay solidly on the ground!The two lines mean that you have a decent amount of control over where this kite goes and it's pretty responsive. All in all& we've thoroughly enjoyed using this kite and it'll get many more outings this Summer I'm sure."
12814,3980,5," With practice can be launched without a helper. Easy to fly& excellent manouverability. Will fly in a 5mph breeze& but better in stronger winds. As it is a power kite it would pull a child off their feet in stronger winds. great fun."
12815,3980,5," Great two line kite for when the winds to strong for your 3m. I leave it in the boot of the car& kids love it& easy to set up and maintain& great quality."
12816,3981,5," Present for grandchild so have not tried it yet but love the size of it and the bright colours"
12817,3982,5," Favourite toy for my son over Christmas. He absolutely loves this. He has all the nerf guns and this is way better."
12818,3982,5," Really good came early works great"
12819,3982,5," Excellent"
12820,3982,5," Excellent"
12821,3983,5," perfect for young children"
12822,3984,1," Advertises has having eyelets but came without them so I cant hang this from my flag pole."
12823,3984,5," This product is og good quality and has bought a lot of joy to friends and neighbours. My Husband now has requests for different flags!!"
12824,3984,5," well. what can I say ? we've had a few people raving around this at festivals. good fun& light weight and flaps well in the breeze"
12825,3984,5," Looks fabulous flying atop my flagpole.  Just what is needed to brighten anyone's day.  My neighbours also love it. Thanks"
12826,3985,4," Great Toy for kids 10+. Really glides a long way and is reasonably robust. However the rubber front nose comes off pretty easily. Overall a fun toy at the right price."
12827,3985,4," A great plane& unfortunately the top wing was cracked when opened (despite good packaging) however the strong stickers are holding it in place so all good."
12828,3986,5," This is a simple& good value toy.  Bought as an extra for my step sons birthday& both he and his friends (age 8) and his younger brother (age 5) thoroughly enjoyed firing the rockets.  You will need quite a bit of space (the rockets can travel!) and my step sons were supervised - which I would def. recommend for young children.  I would also recommend purchasing spare rockets at the same time& otherwise you may find yourself spending most of your time running around."
12829,3986,5," Awesome fun& so much better than the foam darts.  Too bad they didn't last a bit longer& but still& crazy fun for the price.  These things really go at least 300 feet up& maybe more if the winds are OK."
12830,3986,5," I hvae to say this Refill Pack is a excellent Product. Not to say the Rockets are made poorly in the Original Package so they need to be replaced. The fact is the kids have so much fun with the Rockets and so do the Adults that the original Rockets just get throughly used or lost in Trees of Roof Tops.  This Refill Pack is nicely priced and exactly what I needed. It a great product for the kids to learn about flight."
12831,3986,5," If you remember the basics of not aiming near ot at any other person - the stomp rocket is great fun."
12832,3986,5," A bit disapointed with this refil pack& I expected more than three.Nothing wrong with the toy though& but only getting three spare rocketswhen the stomper came including six rockets for nearly the same priceI would'nt have got the spare pack had I known."
12833,3986,4," great fun. Kids loved it. Just need to make sure of the safety issues by pointing it skywards !"
12834,3986,4," This kit gave a lot of pleasure to many children.  The rockets go up a long way&  so it is worth finding a fair-sized open space to play with it.  You can use it in a small garden on a calm day& but will need to 'Stomp' judiciously.  In a park you can stomp harder& and the rockets go amazingly high.Sadly& mine was supplied without the screw which should hold its base together and permit adjustment.  I taped it together and we settled for straight up."
12835,3986,5," This stomper rocket is the best Â£10.00 buy we have made in ages.  It is fun for all the family.  Small children need to be supervised so that it is nor directed at someones face& but this little rocket can go a long& long& way.  We have had contests for how far over the house and onto the front garden can be achieved.  (We have a large& tall house). Thrills for any age group.  Have just ordered some more rockets."
12836,3987,5," We bought these for a garden party we're hosting in September& but the little ones have been practicing and have had a lot of fun with them. They're surprisingly easy to score with and very safe for young children. All in all we're very pleased with the set."
12837,3987,5," Great item& went down a storm with the children over Xmas and safe to use in doors!"
12838,3988,5," Kite flies really well and looks great.  Easy to assemble and great fun."
12839,3988,4," Bought for 5 year old niece who has six imaginary dragon friends. She loves it. Four stars as doesn't fly quite as well as Ice dragon (the blue one) I bought for nephew."
12840,3988,5," looked good quality and sturdy material."
12841,3988,5," Nice design. Best assembled by adult& at least first time. One string& which is quite enough for young children who aren't used to the idea of needing the wind to come from behind to fly a kite. Everyone& adults included& wanted to take this out again the next day."
12842,3989,3," A good starter model but a West wings model is far superior and not much difference in cost."
12843,3989,5," Good quality& everything's in there that you will need& to build your model& all you need to buy is the resin to put on the tissue covering& great model for the price& great seller& Thank you"
12844,3989,5," Just like my last project& the Sopwith tri plane& the Spitfire is a delight to build. great relaxation and a compelling hobby"
12845,3989,1," Bought for my husband and he hated it.  Cheap material - balsa wood sheets were too thin and broke.  When he got the body fully assembled& several of the formers just buckled because the balsa was too thin.  Waste of money and time.  Will never buy again.  When Keilcraft& the original company made them& they used  much more substantial material& ie the balsa wood was thicker and could stand up to the necessary rigours of making the model."
12846,3989,5," just asexpected same as the one I built with my Dad 63 years ago"
12847,3989,5," Purchased as a Birthday Presebt. The recipient was well pleased"
12848,3989,5," gave it to my dad for his birthday and he loved it"
12849,3990,5," My son received one of these as a gift a couple of years ago and I hate to admit the first we used it was this summer! It was used on the beach on a very blustery day while trying to keep 6 5/6 year olds happy.  All I can say is it is brilliant!  I didn't expect much for the price tag and the small bag but it's a beautiful traditional kite and had no problems standing up to the strong winds.  Easy to put away again too.  Suitable for all ages.I have now purchased more as gifts for all the other kids who were with us and wanted one too!! The only downside is that although ordering more than one at the same time they all arrived the same colour as apparently Amazon's picking line just pick! (I guess they only open 1 box at a time) That's a real shame as now the kids don't know them apart so it's unlikely they will all play with them together.  I'd have thought common sense at Amazon may have sent me a selection."
12850,3990,5," As I was going away on holiday I wanted to introduce the friends I was staying with to the fun of kite flying but could not take bulky kites in my suitcase...hence the pocket kite...I was a little disappointed because I ordered late and the projected delivery date was 4 days after I left on 1st October...However& the kite was delivered on 30th September which made my day...The kite was packed and has been happily flown with new found enthusiasts in Cyprus...The service from both the seller and Amazon was amazing and I would recommend both the KITE (which we all love very much) and House of Marbles to all of my friends. Thank you!"
12851,3990,3," doesnt fly too well but kids had lots of fun with it.Supplied line possibly too short and not well balanced."
12852,3990,2," Despatch was quick& and quality seems ok but we just cannot get this kite to fly& even on the windy downs near us. it might be there is a nack to it& but it shouldn't be this hard to fly. I suggest paying a bit more and getting a structured kite."
12853,3990,3," Looks a super product to keep in the car to keep the kids busy& but when Gramps tried it our - just to make sure - it did not like the gusting winds that day.  Will try again but a disappointing first outing!"
12854,3990,5," Easy to fly kite& my 4 year old can easily manage to make the kite fly. Arrived quickly& bright coloured.  Fits into a lovely bag which it comes with and would easily fit into a pocket."
12855,3990,5," These kites are great"
12856,3990,5," Nice simple product. Easy to pop in a bag to take to the beach or park - fly really well (wind dependent& obviously!) - would buy again as a gift.  A perfect stocking filler present."
12857,3991,5," This is the best toy airplane I've ever handled. Great design well executed. Superb quality& sturdier than anything else in this class. Wing shape actually creates lift. Nice appearance. Three extra rubber bands included. Most important& it flies beautifully--long& stable flights that make people say |Wow.| And landing upright almost every time. Yes& it will break& eventually& but this is way better than standard balsa wood equivalents. Great gift for an adult geek or a kid who loves flying."
12858,3991,5," Has already provided hours of entertainment for two boys age 47 and 5. Not broken yet!"
12859,3991,5," My 6 year old son loves spitfires and was upset when his last one got broken. Bought him a new one and he's over the moon. Good flight from the plane too. Came quickly and was packaged well."
12860,3991,4," A great gift for an spitfire enthusiasts !!! my other half thought this was fab and I was so surprised at how well it flew. I was a little concerned at how flimsy it appeared so I would not recommend it for little ones. definitely more of a man toy than a boy toy. Considerably cheaper than some other sites which where charging over Â£20"
12861,3991,5," All good. Does exactly what it says on the 'tin'. The other positive reviews are quite correct. Worth paying for"
12862,3991,3," Its NOT balsa its made from same stuff as the cheap planes you see in your local shop& wont last long at all"
12863,3991,5," Good boys toy&big or small.Have not opened it yet as it is a gift&bought two of these"
12864,3991,5," Great.  Easy to put together and it flies well.  Cheap and cheerful."
12865,3992,5," Good quality- granddaughter only 4"
12866,3993,4," Unusual and fun item to celebrate 2012 - Golden Jubilee& Olympics& or being British.  As stated& it revolves in the gentlest breeze.  I think the Union Jack (or Flag) is a design icon and it is lovely to see it on so many fun things.  I am pleased with this purchase."
12867,3993,5," A great bit of kit looks the business when flying. Drew lots of attention. Highly recommended. Arrived promptly great service thanks"
12868,3993,4," Bought to decorate a Diamond Jubilee Street Party& used again to decorate the office for the Olympics.  Attractive take on the Union Jack and an eye-catcher.  Would recommend to all those patriots out there!"
12869,3993,5," Very good and looks great& but you intend to keep for a while& you need to replace the spinning part to a strong fishing swivel& as the one supplied is not strong enough for the winds."
12870,3993,5," Lovely colourful balloon to hang on my caravan and blow in the wind when I go on holiday& Good size and brilliant quality."
12871,3993,5," It is great. Really looks great in the wind and is very well made. Many admirers when it was spinning well in the wind."
12872,3994,5," Great Kite"
12873,3995,5," This fish is by far the best quality windsock we have had&previous ones have seemed flimsy in comparison to this one. The material and seams are robust and i have faith that this one may be able to successfully contend with the winds over our back fields. My daughter loves watching it."
12874,3995,5," Extremely bright and very large. Thick material and looks like it will last in the strongest wind . Put in my garden straight away and looks wonderful ."
12875,3995,4," This is a great little windsock& perfect for topping our flagpole at festivals this year. Even keeps it's shape (mostly) in the rain when our flag went a bit limp. 1 pet peeve& the seaweed was sewn with white thread which made it look cheap& but no one can tell when it's flying a few metres up anyway."
12876,3995,5," Quality item. Swivel could be better but that's a thing with wind socks unless you get a specialist rod type swivel. Like all the brookite items I have owned& this seems sturdy and was bought to replace my last identical fish which lasted about 10 years. I take it down in winter as the storms in Scotland would make it fly off into oblivion& but it's up 9 months each year. The last one just faded and started to fray a bit after 10 years."
12877,3995,5," This is a colourful windsock that does exactly what it should do.  The package arrived on time and as promised."
12878,3995,4," it flys from my whip at the caravan ok the kids love it came in quick time ( in a bit to big box)"
12879,3995,4," Used to identify our caravan so the kids can find their way home following going off to play.  In 40 mph winds it has stayed firmly secured and the colours have stayed bright and vibrant.  However& the clip has rusted up and is very difficult to use now.  Shame they didn't go for stainless for an OUTDOOR windsock!"
12880,3995,5," I love to watch this flying fish in the wind.  My mum hates it& which makes it all the better!  Happy days!"
12881,3996,5," Easy to assemble& easy to start flying straight away."
12882,3997,5," Bought for my grandson arrived promptly and was packaged well. Good quality every happy with this purchase"
12883,3998,5," Have used this product four times now& at three festivals |Chagstock|& |Blissfields|& |Beautiful Days| and a party round our place. Many configurations used with multiple flags and banners tied on with small cable ties. A top rated product. Does the job nicely. Just use your common sense and don't put a big flag or heavy item on the top section in very high winds... but then if you need that sort of advice I suggest you don't buy this product as you will probably poke your eye getting it out of the packet!"
12884,3998,5," Very good for Summits on the Air antenna mast as usual. I throw away the top two sections which are too weak for antenna support and thread a boot lace through holes drilled in the two end caps then head for the hills."
12885,3998,1," Have been eagerly waiting delivery of this pole to display my balloon kite it arrived today and to my dissapointment no eyelett on the end of the pole very dissapointed customer i'm affraid."
12886,3998,4," You need to have either the spike (sold separately) to fix this to or some other ground anchor or way of fixing it to the ground. Due to the height& they will sway a lot so be careful in wind.  One gripe is that to stow it when not used there is a plastic end screw cap that can break if the insides move.  If this happens contact the distributor (keep the delivery note!) who will contact the manufacturer who will send you a replacement for free.Summary - a good buy& with a small manageable fault"
12887,3998,4," Product is as described& arrived swiftly& withstood recent high winds&good value for money& is of good quality. compact for storing"
12888,3998,4," not used as toy but a flag pole. kids love it when i put the wind sock on. Keeps kids mesmorised"
12889,3998,1," This broke the first time we used it. Very slight winds only& so we were most disappointed. We have a small spinner yet this could not withstand the slight winds and it broke at the tip.It broke on our first time  using it.Amazon refunded and are TOPS as always. We would not and could not recommend this telescopic pole but still recommend Amazon."
12890,3998,4," This was used to calibration of high level temperature sensors. It did exactly what we wanted. Got the meter probe up 3 meters in the air for calibration without the need for cherry pickers of sissor lifts. Saved a fortune. Job done. Only minor pick up is it could do with an end cap to secure the parts. But that is a very minor finding."
12891,3999,4," Nice little puzzle. Bought as a gift and I'm sure it will be gratefully received. Only downside is the pieces are a little smaller than expected but nothing worth complaining about."
12892,4000,5," A bundle of fun if you like this sort of thing (I do). This is a good choice of picture for an entertaining puzzle with lots of dazzlingly bright colours and a good variety of faces. This makes it one of the more straightforward Clementoni art puzzles - a good choice perhaps as a family project."
12893,4000,5," I enjoyed doing this jigsaw and I will reccomment this seller to anyone"
12894,4001,5," This is a Xmas present so no idea of the quality yet. Arrive very quickly and well packaged.Probably a bit overpriced for what it is."
12895,4001,5," My son loves it"
12896,4002,5," Quality puzzle as per Wasgij standards....however after the election this puzzle imploded and separated into four quarters........"
12897,4002,5," Loving these jigsaws& the only negative was there wasn't a Imagine if SNP win .... well packed and prompt delivery"
12898,4002,5," Up to the usual standard for Wasgij puzzles. Very entertaining!"
12899,4002,5," Mum is really looking forward to doing this jigsaw& she's working on another wasgij that I bought her for Christmas at the moment"
12900,4002,5," I bought this after the election& but it is still a fun puzzle& came quickly and well packaged& all the Wasgij puzzles are great."
12901,4002,5," There's so many pieces -  could find any brains though... only promises and lies!"
12902,4002,4," Still completing this puzzel& but really enjoying it."
12903,4002,5," Brilliant! Received very quickly. Great jigsaw!"
12904,4003,4," Bought as a Christmas present for a 4 year old Sure she will be delighted with it when she starts to build jigsaw. Good price !!"
12905,4003,5," Our daughter absolutely loved it."
12906,4003,4," Good value for money."
12907,4004,5," Love the picture of this cottage I'm recently widowed and my husband and I always talked about retiring to a cottage exactly like this."
12908,4004,5," Gorgeous puzzle but quite difficult in the latter stages when you are trying to sort out the greenery and flowers."
12909,4004,5," another brillant puzzle"
12910,4004,5," Good puzzles"
12911,4005,5," Our granddaughter loves puzzling and she loves anything to do with glamour princess' . She has the patience to sort out the colours which is not always easy."
12912,4006,5," likethe item& because it shows my  city& Budapest. The quality of the jigsaw is excelent. I offer tit to everyone"
12913,4006,4," My dad loves jigsaws and this one had a lovely picture& sufficiently complicated to keep him busy for a few weeks."
12914,4006,5," Good quality puzzles"
12915,4006,5," very nice !"
12916,4006,5," I love it"
12917,4007,5," I bought this as a present for jigsaw fanatics and they loved it.  1000 pieces was challenging but not daunting and the picture was really uplifting on a dull day.  The puzzle also came with a poster of the picture which was really useful."
12918,4007,5," This puzzle kept us busy for hours.  The artwork is great with some interesting little details and crazy characters peppered throughout.  The triangular box added to the character& and the accompanying full size picture proved a really useful guide.  Overall& great quality and very happy.  Now that it's finished I'm going to get it framed and am looking forward to getting another Mordillo to keep me busy!  Would definitely recommend!"
12919,4008,5," Great fun for all ages& worth the money& daughter loved it and enjoyed building it on Christmas day highly recommended."
12920,4008,4," Good Quality jigsaw. We now have UK - Europe"
12921,4008,2," Lovely jigsaw but some of the pieces were creased and one but is faulty."
12922,4008,5," 6 year old loved it& educational and fun!"
12923,4008,5," Wanted jig map to get my daughters to understand where the different countries are.  It has worked well and they quiz each otheron locationsetc."
12924,4008,3," bought as present but a little disappointed in quality when it arrived& don't know what recipient thought - unlikely to say in reality"
12925,4008,5," Daughter had Europe one& but World one was also tremendous and kept her busy many times& are really great products!"
12926,4008,4," Good but the small pieces with the countries names on it go missing quickly."
12927,4009,4," A nicely created picture  with much historical content. As with all `House of Puzzles` products& the quality of the board and cutting is fine& despite the inclusion of the usual `irregular` shaped pieces."
12928,4010,4," This was fun and relatively quick to do& with no real time-consuming sky& sea or greenery to puzzle(!) over.The pieces are of a very high quality and fit together well.  As is typical of Gibsons& the jigsaw contains a variety of different shaped pieces including my favourite '4-pronged' kind& which I like to hide from others and keep until the very end and guaranteed that 'last piece' honour!The picture of a 1970s street scene is by Tony Ryan and there is a little piece about him on the reverse of the sturdy presentation box& which measures around 25 cm square.Made up& the jigsaw measures around 49 cm x 33.5 cm and fits comfortably onto a 500-piece puzzle carrier.The finished product is more obviously a 'jigsaw' picture than some others I have completed over the festive season so not a great one for gluing and displaying& if this is your thing."
12929,4010,5," A nice little jigsaw depicting days gone by. I well remember scenes like this in my far away youth Brilliant."
12930,4010,4," Nice puzzle but on a few pieces the picture had to glued back on.  The puzzle fitted together well an overall was pleased with the puzzle."
12931,4010,4," Enjoyed this jigsaw. Bought many of Gibsons jigsaw in the past.  Great to swap with friends and family.  Can always recommend them."
12932,4010,4," This is ideal for a wet afternoon& I enjoyed doing it - but it does not exactly test the brain."
12933,4010,5," Very happt with my purchase. Purchased as a Christmas present and very happy to give this item to my sister. Just as seen. Very satifsfied. thank you"
12934,4010,5," Good quality pieces and very nice picture"
12935,4010,5," The puzzle has it all...fast delivery& good value for money& and it is a really lovely puzzle to do. Have nearly finished this one and can't wait to start the other one that I brought."
12936,4011,5," This Jigsaw must have more grease than a chipshops extractor fan or does it??? Once again those Wasgij people have does us proud.This is one of the brilliant.. What does the future hold?Will the Greaser's retain their verdant locks never mind the colour?Wil the svealte girlfirnds retain their waspish figures...Well what do you think?Does Bill Haley Rock around the Clock??Exactly!This is a great addition to the series and a brilliant bit of fun.These jigsaws always produce a great talking point in our house (Imagine Trivial Pursuit and you've got an idea) and are so attractive to do and there are plenty of jokes to discover that everyone mucks in.Why?You have to use  clues about the youthful bikers depicted  to get the final picture of today to get you going but after a while you get the hang of it. (Hence the name backwards!)The Construction.Robust. The pieces fit together well and the notches are easy to sort into the various types to ease trying. The joy is once done you can put them away and re-vist in 2 years time or donate to the charity shops perhaps?I've always found this type of jigsaw more engaging than just follow the box. The results always bring a smile to our faces with jokes aplenty.Heck if you look at the amount produced and how long they've lasted they must be doing something right?"
12937,4011,5," I bought three wasjigs at the same time for a present they were greatly appreciated and classed as very good They are adult jigsaws They arrived on time and the packaging was good.  Although I thought the box they were in was a larger than it need be."
12938,4011,5," I enjoy jigsaws and these Wasgij jigsaws have that added edge. You are given clues as to what may have changed from the picture on the box& that is all the help you get. It can be quite a challenge to imagine the changes depending on which ones you choose from the Original& Destiny or Mystery collections.Hours of relaxing fun for all the family!"
12939,4011,3," Wasgijs are always fun and make you think even more than normal jigsaws.  This one works particularly well for those |of a certain age| ... we laughed a lot at the characterisation!"
12940,4011,4," Thought this was a round puzzle as that is what my wife wanted.. unfortunately wasn't but still fun to do. The wasgij puzzles are generally good quality and challenging."
12941,4011,5," Another one for the collection&these puzzles bring hours&days of fun&more of these to come for next summer&good fun everytime."
12942,4011,5," Made this with my younger cousins who thought it was hilarious when the picture on the lid isn't the same as on the jigsaw."
12943,4012,5," Lovely puzzle for animal lovers& bought as an add on as it was so cheap& great quality jigsaw pieces& would recommend."
12944,4012,5," Another winner!  I love jigsaws and cats (and I'm quite fond of dogs too) so I had to buy this!  A delight to do!"
12945,4012,5," Bought as an add on as it was so cheap. Its great"
12946,4012,5," Cute jigsaw for cat lover"
12947,4012,4," Have not started this puzzle yet but the colours are vibrant and it will hopefully be easy to identify the pieces......."
12948,4012,5," The picture is very cute and perfect for my daughter's room."
12949,4013,5," Even though it's 500 peice jigsaw puzzle& it's hard to do still haven't completed it.However keeps the kids busy during holidays."
12950,4013,5," Great puzzle. Took us 5 days to do a bit each night."
12951,4013,5," Lovely puzzle."
12952,4013,3," Good"
12953,4014,5," Trying to think of something different& I chose this for a 60th birthday present for a female friend& who loves puzzles.  She was thrilled with this one& and couldn't wait to complete it.  The memories of days gone by was nostalgic and funny.  We usually share puzzles& but she is holding on to this one!"
12954,4014,5," This is a great product from several perspectives. Those of us in our latter years can enjoy the nostalgia while my grandchildren found it fascinating trying the recognise the products that were still available in today's supermarkets albeit in changed packaging. The only regret is that being so fascinated& I was hooked and completed it fairly quickly. The pieces are well made and fit together well so no issue on quality. Delivery too was prompt. There are other decades in the product range too if the 50's doesn't appeal. I would definitely recommend this range to |jigsaw anoraks| and |casual participants| alike."
12955,4014,5," I enjoy doing jigsaws as it helps to pass the long cold winter nights and get great satisfaction when completed"
12956,4014,5," Bought for an elderly relative& they loved it and I will most likely buy another as once it was completed it became a great talking point!"
12957,4014,1," Good Point - It arrived on time& no problem thereBad Point - Puzzle was given as a present to someone who has just finished it... To then find out it had pieces missing!! Highly disappointing!"
12958,4014,5," Fabulous present& brings back lots of memories. A really interesting jigsaw puzzle. looked great when finished. Would highly recommend for those with birthdays in the any of the years."
12959,4014,4," I also bought a chocolate one as a present& the recipient& and her family& thoroughly enjoyed it& so I see no reason why the person who received this shouldn't feel the same."
12960,4014,5," Got this for my nan who was young in this era. She has had lots of fun with  it as took her down memory lane. Its great for the old relative that you are unsure what to buy."
12961,4015,5," Pretty difficult - does the job!"
12962,4016,5," Have had to put this away before finishing it as need space for making all things Christmas. However so far so good. Extremely difficult to do. Will give you hours of endless piece matching. A challenge for anyone who's looking for one."
12963,4016,4," Good old fashioned annoying fun was had contained only 999 pieces very annoyed to have finished the puzzle and find its missing 1 piece..."
12964,4016,5," Well made& very accurately cut"
12965,4016,5," Very good quality!!!"
12966,4017,5," Arrived safely"
12967,4018,4," This is a novel idea. The product arrived on time and was well received. child stopped what he was doing to concentrate on creating his own puzzle& pulling it apart and putting it together again.  He is age 4 and was a good gift.l"
12968,4019,5," A change of subject for me"
12969,4020,5," Bought these jigsaws for my daughter and her boyfriend who are into Vintage Steam in a big way. I know they will love completing them. An inexpensive present that I would certainly recommend."
12970,4020,2," I bought this puzzle because of the railway  pictures. The pieces were brilliant to fit together  but the quality of the pictures were poor. I wont buy another Ravensburger puzzle again.Mike Hill"
12971,4020,5," My father was a fireman and driver of steam trains many years ago& he was so thrilled that i found these particular jigsaws.He will be 80 next month so i intend to purchase more from you when he has completed the ones he's just receivedMany thanksJill"
12972,4020,5," An interesting puzzle .The accomplished artist has captured the ethos of preserved railways.Tornado is a newly built and much admired engine"
12973,4020,5," pictures interesting but not overcomplicated. Pieces of a reasonable size and colours that are are well blended together make it a good buy."
12974,4020,5," I had allot of pleasure doing these two jigsaws the quality of the jigsaws is very good and I would recommend these jigsaws"
12975,4020,4," Very well made and excellent choice of subject& I love old steam trains. Will give many happy hours of enjoyment."
12976,4020,5," Good second hand purchase for an elderly friend with dementia."
12977,4021,5," bought this for my grandson who is 6 years old he loves it great buy would recommend this puzzle bright colours so easy to see where pieces go."
12978,4021,5," My grandson loved his busy and sturdy puzzle. it is the first time he has had 100 piece jigsaw of his own and it has already been assembled several times. The quality of the puzzle is very very good."
12979,4021,4," When it arrived it was exactly as expected with no problem with product. Did feel that the delivery time was a little long. Overall no complaints."
12980,4021,5," Perfect for a digger obsessed little boy in need of a rainy day distraction."
12981,4022,5," 7 year old loved it& bit easy for her to do but lovely ornament when completed."
12982,4022,5," Very simple my daughter can do this puzzle very easily.. she is 8.. wouldn't buy it for anyone older than 6.. far too simple.."
12983,4022,3," I Bought this item for my grand daughter she is 5. It helps her with her numbers Also it keeps her very busy."
12984,4022,5," Fab 3d puzzle for my 5 year old todo. Bit fiddly for he little hands at the last piece& but with practice can do. Very sturdy"
12985,4022,4," My 4 and 5 year-old daughters likes the Disney theme and although the jigsaw was too hard for them we used the helpful numbers on the back to build it. It's well made with the pieces clicking in easily and creating a stable final product. I waited a while to buy it from Amazon though - it was out of stock for a while and other sellers for considerably more expensive"
12986,4022,5," My grandaughter thought this puzzle was amazing."
12987,4022,5," Bought this for my niece& all the pieces have numbers and arrows on the underside so assembly is fairly straight forward and is nice to leave up once completed"
12988,4022,5," Exactly as advertised. Good Quality & great for children to be able to build puzzles. Prompt service"
12989,4023,5," My eight year old daughter loves playing with this... everything in our house would be Blue Nose themed if she had her way!"
12990,4023,4," I Bought this as a gift for christmas its a lovely puzzle and great price! the picture is really cute!"
12991,4023,5," good quality strong pieces fun to make with kids a little bit hard for my 7 year old but she enjoys a challenge"
12992,4023,4," A good puzzle for 6-7yr old girls.  Not too complicated or difficult to do. Well worth buying as a present."
12993,4024,4," I enjoyed doing this jigsaw& as the subject is a bit different. Fully interlocking pieces and good picture on the box. Not the easiest of puzzles to do& but interesting as so many items in the chest. Probably more for adults."
12994,4024,5," Thoroughly enjoyed doing this puzzle as it is full of humourous quirks.  Ravensburger puzzles are by far my favourites as they are so well made with solid pieces and good colours.  I shall buy more of their comic series as every inch is full of interest and they are a refreshing change from scenic views which are full of skies and foliage which personally I find very boring."
12995,4024,5," There's nothing boring about any of the Colin Thompson puzzles. The pictures are so detailed and fascinating to assemble. Excellent!"
12996,4024,5," If you want a fun puzzle which is colourful and includes lots of writing& so makes the task a little easier& then this is the puzzle for you.  The prominent colour is yellow but each yellow item is a slightly different shade. Very much enjoying completing it with my 11 year old daughter.  She has done more bits than me!I had to rate the toys educational value and durability but I wouldnt say that was relevant to this puzzle."
12997,4024,5," My daughter is fascinated by the work of Colin Thompson& who did the design for this jigsaw.  She also likes dodos and there is one hidden in the jumble of the mariner's chest.  Therefore& if you have these interests& this gift could be suitable& or if you generally like detailed and bright coloured jigsaws& this is also for you!"
12998,4024,5," Another intriguing Colin Thompson puzzle! (What a mind he must have!). As always relatively difficult to do& satisfying when completed. The quality of the card and the cutting of the pieces excellent. All Ravensburger puzzles are of a high quality."
12999,4024,5," Excellent quality Ravensburger jigsaw ... good strong durable pieces& plenty of colour& box picture to follow and fun to complete. Little hidden 'extras' within the picture& that you don't realise are there until you're completing it! Recommended."
13000,4024,5," Our family Christmas Day challenge 2014. Whole family joined in and we all had fun. I did have to supply endless drinks and chocolates too!!  Have bought one of these puzzles for the last three years. Great quality and entertainment."
13001,4025,5," Became rather difficult to locate& great find and decent value"
13002,4025,5," Grandson happy. Job done."
13003,4026,5," Fantastic jigsaw"
13004,4027,5," HAD ALREADY RECEIVED THE BUTTERFLY PUZZLE& THE FAMILY HAD SO MUCH FUN TRYING TO DO THE PUZZLE IN THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME& MANAGED TO GET IT DOWN TO 28 SECONDS& THIS IS JUST AS MUCH FUN."
13005,4027,4," What a great fun for children! They love playing with it. However& after a while the tiles can be damaged. It could be bit harder as children tend to bend it."
13006,4027,5," Keeps us all on our toes quite frustrating at times."
13007,4028,5," Perfect"
13008,4029,5," This one I found quite difficult to do but was delighted as always with Ravensburger quality& I only ever buy their jigsaws as I can rely on the quality. The one problem I had with this order& was that it took fifteen days for delivery."
13009,4030,5," How impressive is this.  Ordered it on Friday 5th June and it arrived first thing this morning& Saturday 6th June.  It's a Christmas present to be put away for a child& but a friend had the same one and said it was excellent& hence my choice."
13010,4030,5," My 8 year old son really enjoyed doing this jigsaw and we will definately opt for more Wasjigs in the future."
13011,4030,5," Arrived quickly& bought for a Xmas gift so not opened but looks excellent quality as with all jumbo jigsaws"
13012,4030,5," Christmas here we come."
13013,4031,5," Excellent all roundMy search engine found this as been the cheapest.The perchance was easy straight throw no bother.The delivery was within time limits.rapt  as would expect."
13014,4031,5," Probably the best jigsaw on the Titanic ship I have so far encountered. It is huge fun assembling it. Highly recommend it."
13015,4031,4," Have not attempted it yet& but pieces are well made and colours are very good. I am impressed with the design"
13016,4031,5," Excellent Jigsaw puzzle& was quite hard to do& but it was worth it in the end"
13017,4032,5," Love my jigsaw as I love Thailand and it's quite hard to find jigsaws with Thai scenes :)"
13018,4033,4," I ordered this and was pretty bummed when I got a different puzzle than the one on the image here. I got a puzzle with a picture of Shanghai city. I guess I should have read the description better& but when shopping for puzzles I go for the image. Price and delivery was great though& but still- I wanted this one: Trefl Puzzle Lijiang River Pieces"
13019,4034,5," Really good product.  My toddler son and I have really enjoyed putting the puzzle together time and time again.I would thoroughly recommend."
13020,4034,5," Our 3 year old Grandson thinks these are the tops for his Christmas& he can't wait to get home and lay it out"
13021,4035,5," Usual super quality puzzle as expected from Orchard Toys.  Nothing to dislike&  a bit difficult for my 2.5 year old to do himself&  but he enjoys doing it with us at the moment.  I can see him mastering it himself within the next year."
13022,4035,4," This is a great jigsaw for my 3 year old - however I should have checked the costs before ordering as this cost me â‚¬29 euro (overall)and I found the same Jigsaw the following day in Easons - (Ireland) for â‚¬12."
13023,4035,5," lovely clear puzzle&delivery was prompt&great price when bought as multiple pack.Nothing beats Orchard puzzle standard of colour &clarity and sturdyness for our heavy handed 3 year old&he just loves these puzzles."
13024,4035,5," My 3 year old boy loves this jigsaw. The Pieces are a good size for his hands and hold well as a floor puzzle due to being reasonably thick. Would recommend."
13025,4035,5," My friend's little boy loved it.  He is only two and managed it well with adult support.  Fab quality and great price.  Also arrived quickly and well packaged."
13026,4035,5," Great size& for little hands. Wonderful design for children of both sexes who love police cars and anything to do with them. Loved by my 3yr  old granddaughter"
13027,4035,5," Bought for my grandson for Christmas and I am sure he will enjoy it. He loves jigsaws and police cars. Not tried yet but am sure it will be great."
13028,4035,5," Top quality product& lovely colours& a lot of things to look at in the picture once all the pieces are put together. My 2.5 years old loves it!"
13029,4036,5," Pressie for my mum to remind her of her Italian holiday - she loves it."
13030,4036,4," Enjoyed this one& loved the picture."
13031,4037,5," Bought this for my elderly parents who love to do jigsaws. They thoroughly enjoyed doing all 4. Gibsons jigsaws are excellent quality. Nice thick pieces. The colours were lovely and bright making it easier for my parents to manage."
13032,4037,4," Gibsons Jigsaws are great& but this is the third one I've bought recently which has pieces missing.  Very frustrating.However& Amazon's service is fast&efficient and very cost effective.  Thank you.  Long may you continue!"
13033,4037,5," I have a great number of Jigsaws and this foursome has to be another one of my very best... never get tired of doing these... great price... delivered almost next day... a pleasure to work with... total quality..."
13034,4037,5," these jigsaws are wonderful!!! I bought them for my 4 yr old son ( who is a bit of a whiz at jigsaws it has to be said) and they are perfect. Although the pieces are very small ( and there are a lot of them!!) the colours are so vivid and bright that it actually makes them fairly easy to do.I would recommend these to anyone and especially those of you looking for the next step up from a child's jigsaw ( i.e 100 piece) to something more challenging for a youngster."
13035,4037,3," I have purchased several Gibsons jigsaws& The Postmans Round& A Trip to the Shops& Rag and Bone and The Time of Our Lives and have been delighted with all of them . However l am rather disappointed with Stop Me and Buy One . The printing of the picture is different from the others. Not as sharp and clear. I expect I will still enjoy doing them"
13036,4037,5," My 6 year old daughter loves doing jigsaws and these are a serious challenge for her in terms of the number of pieces - 500 is significantly more than kids jigsaws.This box of four comes at a great price. The pieces are good quality so can take a bit of rough treatment and they slot together neatly so you know when you've got the right piece in place.The pictures are fantastic - very colourful and interesting. For older people (ahem) they hark back to olden times and are quite a fascinating slice of British cultural history.From a puzzle perspective& they make life so much easier as the variety within the picture gives you a fighting chance of putting the jigsaw back together in the right order!As the winter weather takes over I think we'll be spending a good few wet and rainy days working on these puzzles.Recommended!"
13037,4037,5," Gibson's jigsaws are great. As an elderly person I love the nostalgic ones and no larger than the 500 pieces ones. There are also some great 1000 pieces ones but to make them I have to bend over more which hurts my back."
13038,4037,5," I am absolutely delighted with this set of jigsaws& it arrived very quickly and is well made and a pleasure to do."
13039,4038,5," the best jigsaws ever"
13040,4038,5," Excellent"
13041,4039,5," My 2.5 yr-old grandson can almost do this without help but the lightness of the pieces mean they sometimes get stuck to his arms when he reaches across to put a piece in somewhere. I realise this is meant for 6+ yrs but a slightly heavier board would have made this perfect."
13042,4039,5," bought this for my 3year old grandson he loved it.nice colourful picture and not to hard to make &would recommend to others"
13043,4040,4," Does an excellent job of holding puzzle together but be aware that when used with |glow in the dark| products| the puzzle will dim and no longer hold its glow."
13044,4040,5," Puzzle conserver is& of course& not a toy.  It's glue.  It works perfectly& drying to an invisible finish.Some issues raised by other users suggest they are trying to skimp on the glue - it's important to use the amount suggested in the instructions.  Having said that& we've glued four 1&000 piece jigsaws and still have around 20% left.If you want to display jigsaws& this is perfect."
13045,4040,5," I am constantly using this glue for protecting my puzzles. It is the best.It keeps the puzzle pieces together but also protects its giving a bitof shiny view"
13046,4040,5," This isn't a toy& well I hope it isn't!  If you are looking for great glue that really holds your jigsaw puzzle together this is it!  I've used this on a 3000 piece jigsaw and there was plenty left for perhaps another one.  It does look very foamy when first applied but it soons dry out and keeps the puzzle intact.  This glue will seem through the pieces so make sure you have card or paper below the puzzle unless you want your jigsaw to stick to the table!!  Very good prodcut& I would recommend it."
13047,4040,4," If you want your puzzle pieces to stick together and not fall apart when picked up& then get this. This looks and smells like a water-downed version of the type of safe glue you give to kids. I bought a frame with just a glass panel& and used the glue on the image side and turned it over (once it had dried) and sparingly glued the other side (don't over do it too many times or the underside of the pieces will dye the sponge and the paper will start to peel off in little clumps and make the puzzle lumpy-looking in when flat on the image side)& once that's dry (and you don't want a glass panel) get another glue to glue the image to the back part of the frame. Note that if you do put too much glue in some areas and not in the others& some areas will stick to the back frame and others places it won't.Overall very good."
13048,4040,5," does exactly what it says on the bottle but it defintely needs to be applied more than once (one coat)to workproperly"
13049,4040,2," It's ok for normal puzzles. However& be aware that it isn't your normal sort of glue. It's extremely fluid and doesn't hold puzzles together as strongly as normal puzzle glue. I used lots of it and even tried a second coat but it just isn't as strong as other puzzle glues. However& it does dry matte which is a nice effect for some puzzles. DO NOT use it on any sort of special effect puzzle& it dissolves any sort of special effects coating. As one other reviewer mentioned& glow in the dark puzzles will lose their glow. I tried it on a puzzle with gold metallic pieces and was shocked when the gold came off."
13050,4040,4," I had to apply this conserver VERY generously and about 4 times before the puzzle could hold together. I would say the whole bottle is enough for about 2& maybe 3 1500-piece puzzle. It takes almost as long to conserve a puzzle as it takes to put it together. I am a bit disappointed. Still a useful product& though!!"
13051,4041,4," An interesting& attractive and good quality puzzle - well up to expectations and typical of a House Of Puzzles product."
13052,4041,4," Arrived quickly and safely& thank you...another great design for jigsaw fans!"
13053,4041,5," It a lovely puzzles to do& but it very hard to do"
13054,4041,5," I loved it thank you very much"
13055,4041,5," great service an puzzle."
13056,4042,5," I did enjoy making puzzle but found it too easy& I'd recommend it for younger puzzlers and puzzlers just starting."
13057,4043,5," This was a present for my daughter-in-law who really enjoyed doing it.  It has a nice& old-fashioned theme and is a fun puzzle to do."
13058,4043,3," Not sharp enough focus or detail for me however ok to do."
13059,4043,5," Brill"
13060,4043,5," Very pleased."
13061,4043,5," nice"
13062,4044,5," FABULOUS all round. A very enjoyable puzzle to complete with some seldom seen characters included. I would thoroughly recommend this puzzle."
13063,4044,4," lovely puzzle a joy to do"
13064,4044,5," Not put it together yet but came quickly and looks great."
13065,4044,5," Gorgeous puzzle."
13066,4045,3," Small box& so it needs to be sorted in a bigger one. The puzzle is low quality - loads of puzzle dust. It's easy to assemble& but I guessed that before I bought it& so the three stars are for the tiny box and the dust."
13067,4045,5," Unusual cut to this puzzle makes it more interesting!"
13068,4046,5," A very good puzzle& the second one of its type that I have purchased& nicely difficult but not exasperating& and quick delivery too"
13069,4047,5," grandaughter loves it"
13070,4048,5," This took my lad much longer to complete than expected.  Now sits on a shelf next to the stadium puzzle."
13071,4049,5," Really pleasant puzzle to work on. Pretty picture with lovely colours. It's not to difficult so great fun for all the family!"
13072,4049,4," again good quality and enjoyed completing it but this one has 3 pieces missing"
13073,4049,5," done 5 all great."
13074,4050,5," nice product& granddaughter very happy"
13075,4050,5," Great thank you"
13076,4050,5," Very pleased!!"
13077,4051,5," A lovely jig saw."
13078,4052,5," my little girl loved this product. well made and wonderful colours just what a four year old needs on a birthday"
13079,4052,5," great jigsaw and a great price& my little girl loves doc mcstuffins and im sure she will love this gift"
13080,4052,5," I pre ordered this item as my just turned 2 year old is obsessed with doing jigsaw puzzles& and with the Disney show Doc McStuffins.We already have a Minnie Mouse version& and this new Doc McStuffins set is just as good.  The puzzles are bright and colourful& but easy to put together for little fingers.  Having four puzzles in the box& of varying difficultly& gives more 'playability'& my daughter loves choosing which puzzle to do next.Excellent to help logic and hand eye co-ordination& highly recommended"
13081,4052,4," Great jigsaws of varying difficulty. Downside is that they need seperating before playing. A simple card divider would make this product 5*"
13082,4052,5," A good selection of jigsaws that provide many hours of fun. Would recommend from 4 years plus. Very much enjoyed"
13083,4052,4,""
13084,4052,4," Had already purchased the Minnie mouse version of this last Christmas and my daughter loved those so she was equally pleased with these as she loves all things Disney Junior!! She's not 3 yet so they are a bit tricky but with plenty of practice we'll crack them soon enough!!Lovely puzzles and great price!"
13085,4052,5," Brought for grand-daughter just as a little treatshe loved it& as it is Doc Mcstuffin one of her favourite Disneywas good value for money and it helps in her developmentDefo worth the 5*"
13086,4053,5," excellent vaue& arrived quickly and enjoyed doing the puzzle"
13087,4053,5," Good quality card for the pieces and bright colours that make it easy to get started on the puzzle.I will definitely buy Schmidt again."
13088,4053,5," 100% as expected"
13089,4053,5," Excellent thank you"
13090,4053,5," Excellent item"
13091,4054,5," My decision to my buy this puzzle was more out of curiosity for how small the pieces would be&and yes they are small&but dont let that put you of for a moment&cause if you love your jigsaws as i do than this new range will allow you to challenge yourself in a new way.Whats great is the puzzle takes up far less space then a normal 1000pc which i found a plus and it will probably take you a little longer to do but i didnt mind that as i got more time out of the puzzle than i normally do&so yes its challenging and great to have done&so much so ive brought the other 3 off amazon and cant wait to complete them all."
13092,4054,3," I love jigsaws. This one wasn't quite what I expected. I expected it to have a smaller width (my bad& I should read more carefully)& but I also expected better quality pieces.The small form factor is nice& but the pieces fit too loose. It's hard to keep pieces in place so sometimes we are not really sure if two pieces are ment to be together or not."
13093,4054,4," Have now puzzled about 2/3 of this puzzle& and once i got used to the smaller sized pieces (big fingers) i found it as fun as any other challenging puzzles :-)If you are considering purchasing this& go for it! It doesn't take up much space anyway(42x29cm)"
13094,4054,5," I gave this as a present to some friends who are jigsaw addicts. It was a lot of fun watching them go OMG& can I do that? They did and they said it was challenging& in their world that means a lot of fun (they live in a small world!).I am not sure how eductaional it is& but after doing this jigsaw you will know about Machu Piccu.Not for the feint hearted or novice jigsawer& but highly recomended for those capable and interested to accept the challenge."
13095,4054,5," I love these jigsaws so much I have 6& and having just discovered there are 3 more& will be buying them shortly. They are A3 in size& so if you have a reasonably sized tray I find they fit on perfectly& great for putting away easily& no more wailing and teeth gnashing every time someone wants to use the dining table. The quality is excellent& the pieces are nice and thick and fit together well& and the size of the pieces is just about the same as an average-sized fingernail.I actually had my husband bring one into hospital for me when I was being induced with our second child- I was stuck in bed all day& with nothing to do& and I managed to do the whole thing. Don't let that fool you into thinking these aren't a challenge- I buy these precisely because a regular 1000 piece puzzle just isn't a challenge for me any more& and the only reason I completed it so quickly was a combination of being dared by the tea lady and sheer bloody-mindedness!At a fiver each they're a relative bargain& and I strongly recommend them.If you're looking for something cheap& good quality and easily portable& I can highly recommend these. I bet you could even do them in the car. :)"
13096,4054,5," Before seeing this little gem in a shop a few years back I have never heard of Cheatwell brand before. But since I love puzzles I had to get this 1000 smallest pieces one& mainly for the reason of it not requiring a big space. When I opened it - I was pleasantly surprised of the quality. I soon had to get all the others from the series!My favourite ones is definitely this and pyramids. They look absolutely wonderful in a nice frame and hanged. It's these small pieces that make the puzzle look amazing and almost just like a plain picture from afar! Everyone will appreciate your effort and will want to get one themselves!If you want a little challenge and a beautiful finished picture - definitely give this series a go!"
13097,4054,5," I bought four of these puzzles of places we have been (2 from Amazon).  My husband started on the Machu Piccu first and has found it very challenging but also enjoyable.  We intend to frame them and hang them along the hall as memories of our visits as the colours are perfect and scenes depicted exactly.  Durability does not apply to puzzles obviously but they are well made and fit together perfectly.The educational value is tremedous as all the grandchildren now know where the four places are in the world and what they look like.The details of the puzzle were correct and I am very pleased with our purchase."
13098,4054,5," I am usually reluctant to try brands other than Ravensburger& due to the pieces often being too thin& and not sticking together properly& but this brand is really good. I bought 3 of their jigsaws so far& and they are brilliant! It means I can fit a 1000 pc jigsaw on a surface smaller than a normal 500 pc jigsaw. And the pieces are very easy to handle& no need for pinchers or anything. My only wish is that they make more& as there are currently only 5-6 different images available."
13099,4055,5," Quick fast delivery& item as described"
13100,4056,5," a puzzle of medium difficulty looks nice when it is completed."
13101,4057,5," The trouble with little children is that it can be difficult to assess their capability. The information for this jigsaw tells us that its for 3 years onwards and I would say that is fair assessment as the child will definitely need to have a good understanding of numbers& shape and pattern. You're probably thinking that's an obvious statement and it is& but I was hoodwinked by a 19 month old toddler into thinking that she would cope with something this advanced. Guess what - Dad was wrong! There is a marked difference between stuffing shapes into holes& numbers into a famous caterpillar& and the true jigsaw (albeit a large floor jigsaw) that this is. 30 pieces in total& 3 across by 10 high& this is a lovely puzzle that offers lots of activity and questions - they have even put a list on the back of the box as a prompt for us adults (see my photo). Overall the quality is excellent and I can thoroughly recommend it for the right age group!"
13102,4057,5," My 2.5yr old loves his Orchard jigsaws as they are bright& durable and the pictures are spaced out well over the pieces so there is nearly always a bit of something to find (the wheel& the man's hat& the blue car etc). He is awesome at jigsaws and I love doing them with him as we learn vocabulary& reinforce colours and words he already knows and with this one we are learning to recognise numbers. The puzzle comes with a poster the same size so we have started by putting the puzzle together on top of it until he gets better at identifying the numbers."
13103,4057,5," I was looking for a puzzle that would act as a learning aid and was the right thickness for a child of two& and found this puzzle to be great. I have purchased other Orchard puzzles as a result and none of them disappointed me or my child."
13104,4057,4," This is more than just a jigsaw puzzle. There are all kinds of questions and activities relating to the puzzle on the back of the box which add to the fun for children.I had not heard of Orchard Toys before but I would certainly buy other puzzles from them in the future."
13105,4057,4," I would highly recommend this jigsaw. I bought it for my 2 1/2 year old and she's played/made up jigsaw every day since. It comes with a matching poster which was a nice bonus. The pieces are well sized and durable& picture detail is spot on."
13106,4057,5," My son got this for his third birthday and absolutely loves it. The pieces are substantial and of lovely quality. It still looks as good as new. Six months on he is enjoying it even more as he is learning his numbers. The poster which is a picture of the jigsaw is an added bonus and looks lovely in his bedroom. Again every night he points to the numbers which is obviously helping him recognise them as well as count. Overall a lovely jigsaw but educational too. It would make a lovely present for any little boy or girl."
13107,4057,5," My two year-old son adores this puzzle. As with all Orchard puzzles there is a lot going on so the pieces are easily differentiated. My son loves counting all the different animals and putting the numbers in order up the tree. It has been a great way for him to become familiar with written numbers and the order they go in. The pieces are large and easy for small hands to put in place and it comes with a poster which is a bonus."
13108,4057,5," Fantastic product :)  The pieces are made from very durable board and the colours are vivid and inviting for little hands!  I bought this product for my 2yr old and she loves it!  The central column of numbers make the puzzle quite |linear| and if she gets stuck there are always the side pieces to help things along!  This is a firm favourite in our toy box now!  I would definitely recommend this item and will now be searching for other Orchard Toys products!"
13109,4058,5," Nice puzzle"
13110,4059,5," my 7 year old daughter and i really enjoyed completing this jigsaw. it had lovely colours and is well made."
13111,4059,5," my grandaugther of 10 loved this"
13112,4060,5," I bought this puzzle for my wife a present for Christmas and she just loves the scene. Its so colourful and full of  activity&and has the delightful taste of the old days.of Scotland."
13113,4060,5," Very beautiful picture depicting old Edinburgh. Colourful and easy to assemble& very enjoyable. Had several Ravensburger jigsaws now and will definitely be buy more."
13114,4060,5," in all excellent puzzle to do& and of very good quality& I would recommend Ravensburgh puzzles to anyone& Thank You John."
13115,4060,4," I like Ravensburger puzzles because no two pieces are the same& and this is a colourful scene ."
13116,4060,4," you can always depend on ravensburger top quality puzzles & good themes  highly recommend"
13117,4061,5," Lovely picture and although only 500 pieces is quite difficult but well worth it."
13118,4061,5," good delivery.puzzle suitable for all ages with good quality pieces.it would be appreciated if even more round puzzles could be made available."
13119,4062,5," Great puzzle& will be a Christmas gift. Very prompt delivery from the Yorkshire Jigsaw Store."
13120,4062,4," Did not realise the pieces were extra large.  Otherwise a good puzzle& not too difficult."
13121,4062,5," Really good challenging but not too hard good quality"
13122,4062,5," As described - granddaughter loved it"
13123,4062,5," Excellent"
13124,4063,1," I bought this for my 5 year old for Christmas as he loves Tom and Jerry!& Imagine my horror after he has unwrapped it and opened it to find that the thing has been cut out all wrong! it has effectively been manufactured broken!& nothing but a waste of money!& i will NEVER buy a Trefl product again!"
13125,4063,5," Brilliant just right for my 4 year old grandaughter"
13126,4063,4," good puzzle bit tricky for 2 year old though!"
13127,4063,5," Very pleased with puzzle"
13128,4063,5," My son love it :) thanks"
13129,4064,5," Purchasing this puzzle was easy& it arrived safe and earlier than planned. The puzzle is a must buy for anyone who enjoys a good puzzle"
13130,4064,5," Taking a long time to complete but a quality jigsaw that's going to look awesome once we do."
13131,4064,5," A challenge at anytime"
13132,4064,5," Top quality!"
13133,4065,5," Nice puzzle! It isn't a puzzle in a box& but in a frame. Saves a lot of space and is easier to puzzle for my 2 year old."
13134,4066,5," I see that it has been some time since I last made a puzle& since the pieces now are a lot more complex& and how they fit together is equally complex."
13135,4066,4," Enjoyed the challenge"
13136,4067,5," These are lovely puzzles for all ages up from 6yrs& bought one for my grandson and he spent ages putting it back together& refused any help as he wanted to do it himself&felt a great sense of achievment when he finished."
13137,4067,5," The magna 3D meerkat puzzle is an excellent game for under 10s. It has the right difficulty level for this age and will keep them occupied for 10-15min.  It has a great image too!"
13138,4067,5," My 7 year old Grandson thought this was absolutely brilliant. It is great value for money& delivery was very quick and packaging so easy to open."
13139,4067,5," love these puzzles& our older grandchildren enjoy them"
13140,4068,5," purchased as a gift for my great niece. fingers crossed she manages it. I'm sure she will let me know."
13141,4069,5," This is a great puzzle combining the architectural features of Durham Cathedral with one of the fine London North Eastern express steam trains â€“ a Nigel Gresley A4 Pacific& perhaps the Flying Scotsman& for those interested â€“ fine and beautiful feats of engineering. It is moderately challenging and contains all the virtues of Ravensburger puzzles: perfectly interlocking pieces& no piece fitting in other than its proper slot. They are the cream of jigsaws and this picture looks far more impressive when made up than the box picture suggests. Recommended."
13142,4069,5," Good quality great image"
13143,4069,5," Another puzzle to look forward to putting together when I've finished the current one."
13144,4070,4," This is very good for my husband who has dementia and he enjoys the picture.  It is fun with large brightly coloured pieces.  The pieces are not very thick so they are slightly difficult to fix together sometimes."
13145,4071,5," As usual arrived promptly and of very good quality"
13146,4072,5," I very much enjoyed doing this jigsaw puzzle.  I liked the bright colours and the interesting scene.  All the pieces fitted together very well indeed.  Highly recommended for any jigsaw puzzle enthusiast."
13147,4072,5," A good jig-saw which I enjoyed doing.  Reasonably straight forward with fairly regular shaped places. A jig-saw of a place I have visited in San Francisco. A good fun puzzle."
13148,4072,5," Another very well made puzzle from Ravensburger. A good picture and a pleasure to do."
13149,4072,5," as usual with Ravensburger very good quality and lovely colours . very engrossing !"
13150,4072,5," Interesting puzzle to complete.  Very colourful.  Good quality pieces."
13151,4073,5," Great puzzle brought back memories from the 70's"
13152,4073,4," Simple the best.  Great!"
13153,4074,5," Fantastic delivery& here well before estimated date. Product great quality."
13154,4074,5," Excellent :)"
13155,4075,5," I bought this product for my sisters birthday as she has just got into doing jigsaw puzzles. I know she will love it as she loves fairies. Its a beautiful puzzle and is of very high quality. I am very pleased with this order"
13156,4075,5," I bought this as a gift for my mother and she was very pleased with it and really enjoyed it"
13157,4075,5," Excellent value for money and prompt delivery"
13158,4076,4," Ok& so we had a problem with this order (stare deducted)& in that another puzzle was sent to us in error. The customer service was excellent& however& and we reached a very amicable agreement& so I'm very happy and would not hesitate to order again."
13159,4077,5," I have had the book for years and am so glad to now have a jigsaw to go along with it.  The children really love these puzzles and as they are of different sizes the different ages and capabilities ofthe children can be met.  The pictures on the jigsaws are bright and colourful and it is quite sturdy. I would recommend these puzzles for young children.  If your children like the story then I am  sure they will love this item.  I also would recommend the seller who delivered this on time and in good condition. I would use this seller again also."
13160,4077,5," My 4 year old Godson Jack loves these! Here's a suggestion for those moaning that the backs are all the same and the jigsaws get jumbled....Jack suggested colouring the backs using his crayons or numbering them. Think before you give bad reviews for such a petty reason. Back to the puzzles...Any child who has Room On The Broom will love these bright pictures straight from the book/film and the pieces are a nice size too."
13161,4077,4," Nicely made& bright colours& in fact exactly the same as the book.My two year old LOVES Room on the Broom and Jigsaws& but he was a little young for this one and found the largest one of the four puzzles very frustrating. So I think it's probably better for 2 1/2 and up& unless you are very good at supervising puzzles& or have a more patient child than I do."
13162,4077,5," I love this story! Everyone knows about The Gruffalo but this story by the same author is just as entertaining and children seem to love it. especially the rhyming and the illustrations. very much recommended. i bought it for a two and a half year old - perfect age group for this sort of story-telling."
13163,4077,5," Bought for three year old's birthday this month.  Loved it& managed them all although I struggled.Look out for the characters which you can also buy.Good purchase& thoroughly recommend."
13164,4077,4," Beautiful jigsaws& lovely quality"
13165,4077,3," not particularly easy for a 3yr old"
13166,4077,5," Purchased as a gift for our son who is mad about jigsaws and even more about Room on the Broom so a perfect gift. Arrived quickly and well packaged. Many Thanks!"
13167,4078,5," The puzzle looks great. Only two comments. The dimensions are wrong& it's actually 56.2 x 56.2 cm. And the clock on the top has a wrong digit (maybe on purpose? Don't know...) There are 2 |XII| and no |XI| (you can actually see it on the picture)."
13168,4078,5," great puzzle& looks a bit more difficult than it is but but for hardened puzzle|doers| not too much of a challenge."
13169,4078,5," Good to do quick delivery and really good to complete nice colours and looks really good"
13170,4078,3," This company puts vat on top of price b careful. Jigsaw great.."
13171,4078,5," This is a stunning jigsaw. Well made and well packaged."
13172,4078,5," Mum spent hours enjoying putting it together"
13173,4079,5," This is the 14th limited edition Christmas jigsaw puzzle from Ravensburger. The picture is as delightful as ever with lots of detail& great colours and very christmassy indeed! The actual pieces are nicely finished and fit together firmly. The jigsaw is a nice size when completed at 50x70 cm. Just right for a table top! My better half buys one every year for her mum who loves doing them then puts them safely away with the rest of her collection. Well worth the price from Amazon. I've seen them over double in other stores!"
13174,4079,4," They still have some way to go before they return to the sheer joy of the Christmas Market or A Country Christmas or Christmas Village& but this is definitely a move in the right direction. As always& Ravensburger deliver a quality puzzle that goes together well and I expect to still be enjoying this one for many years to come."
13175,4079,5," Havn't done a puzzle since i was a kid so decided to get in the christmas spirit and get the old brain going by getting this puzzle cheaper than most stores& my 14 year old helped me do the edge pieces an from then on i didnt get a look in& every spare moment she got she spent doing it& an was even joined by my 19 year old son they loved it&got them away from there computers and tv.fantastic puzzle!"
13176,4079,5," Ravensburger Limited Edition Christmas Jigsaw has become a Christmas tradition in my home. This 2011 puzzle sees Father Christmas checking his map against the names on a signpost whilst his reindeer make friends with local animals. This puzzle seems is a little bit more difficult than previous ones.Its a 1000 piece jigsaw so not a quick completion but fun to do as a start to the Christmas season on dark and chilly winter evenings."
13177,4079,5," A great quality puzzle& good quality and a good pre-christmas treat to get me in the mood. The picture and subject matter was okay but& as often happens& when you start building it and therefore noticing the fine detail it just gets better and better. My son bought me the 2012 jigsaw which I shall complete pre-christmas 2013. I'm looking forward to it already! The same artist& the same quality& the same treat..."
13178,4079,5," Given as Christmas present to my grown up Daughter as she often recalls the one that was brought out every Christmas as a child. She was thrilled with it& and sits every night doing a bit when the children are in bed. The Jigsaw came well packaged and very quick delivery would certainly buy from this seller again"
13179,4079,5," Completed the puzzle only to find 1 piece missing.  A search came up with nothing and as I use a De-luxe Porta Puzzle carrier I do not have any problems usually.  The jigsaw itself was testing but that is part of the fun.  I have contacted Ravensburger for help."
13180,4079,5," A good quality jigsaw. The pieces are cut well and fit together nicely& a nice finish. A good way to spend a winters night doing a festive jigsaw. would recommend to all jigsaw lovers."
13181,4080,4," This was one of Amazon's cheap add ons so I bought it for my son as Christmas Stocking Filler.  The puzzle is of reasonable quality but the pieces are quite small which put my puzzle mad 6 year old off.  Would make an ideal present for any dinosaur& puzzle loving child.  Probably appropriate for age 7 plus."
13182,4080,3," This was bought for my 6 year this Christmas. It states 4+ but we speculates whether this was due to safety rather than difficulty level. The colour of the dinosaurs and background are quite similar so made completing the puzzle difficult. My son enlisted the help of several adults over Christmas to assist him. It was eventually completed and looked good. Please be aware if buying this for young children you may well need to help them."
13183,4080,5," Bought  for  my  grandson  for  Christmas.  Good  price  and  delivered  quickly.  He  hasnt  completed  it  yet  so  cant  confirm  the  quality  but  sure  it  will  be  fine."
13184,4080,3," It is ok& but I expected that it will be in 3D. Unfortunately it is not. It is a simple puzzle."
13185,4081,5," Thanks."
13186,4082,5," Great seller was very happy with the puzzle  the price and the service. ThankyouLooking forward to making it"
13187,4082,4," great for fender fans but very difficult and too large for standard puzzle boards. very satisfying when done."
13188,4083,5," As a fan of the orginal Thunderbirds series& this was just what I wanted."
13189,4083,5," Christmas gift for a relative& an avid collector of Thunderbird items."
13190,4083,5," A great aquasition"
13191,4084,5," The larger puzzle made identifying pieces such as faces and what would be obvious to find more dificult which we enjoyed the challenge very much and will be buying more of the larger puzzels in the future"
13192,4084,4," Thoroughly enjoyed and well worth the effort and price - pieces fitted together well. Just what I wanted and thought I would get."
13193,4085,5," Good product. My 3 year old loves it."
13194,4086,4," Bought as a gift"
13195,4087,5," great gift"
13196,4087,5," Excellent"
13197,4088,5," Second to none delivery received next day totally unexpected. Thank you. Jigsaw is a gift& already owns several all of which are lovely pictures and ideal size for elderly."
13198,4088,5," absolutly excellent puzzles well recomended bought for my youngest daughter who loves them as they are a nice size for her to handle plenty of colours to pick out excellent"
13199,4088,5," we would recomend this product to anyone they are well made and for people with a problem using their fingers they are well worth buying."
13200,4088,5," Yet another great puzzle& my mum loves the size and House of Puzzles are just right for her. Delivered quickly and a good price."
13201,4089,5," Good quality puzzle. Wonderful picture Quick dispatch and a joy to put together especially when recovering from an operation. Thankyou"
13202,4090,5," All good& no issues."
13203,4091,5," Lovely bright jigsaw. Looks amazing when complete. Good quality& fairly challenging though. Really enjoyed doing this jigsaw."
13204,4091,5," Really good puzzle"
13205,4091,5," enjoyed"
13206,4092,5," Great product. My 5 year old loved it!"
13207,4092,5," I have bought the item as a present for my friend's 5 year old daughter and she loved it.The puzzles are good quality and are very colourful. The little girl also loved the idea with the glitter that some pieces are covered with.The puzzles kept the little one occupied for some time and with a little help from her mum& she had it completed in just over 2hours."
13208,4092,5," My Three year old loves& loves& loves this puzzle. It kept her happy on many an occasion. The pieces are a nice medium/large size and the finish is good. The glitter appears to be coated& so it doesn't shed. :)"
13209,4092,5," Really lovely puzzle& the glitter is on the stars and looks as if painted with a glitter nail polish. :) Really nice."
13210,4092,5," The jigsaw looks great& especially with the glitter. Delivered super fast!"
13211,4092,5,""
13212,4092,5," I am sure my granddaughter will love this on Christmas Day."
13213,4092,5," Bought this to go in my daughters stocking. She is frozen mad and this is even glittery. She is 6years old and this puzzle is perfect for ages 5-7years. Quite ready but not boringly so."
13214,4093,5," This is a great jigsaw puzzle for any child who is into jigsaws. I bought it for my three year old great grandson and he really likes it. The pieces are standard jigsaw size so some concentration is required by a child but there is a lot of fine detail in the picture and it is relatively easy to work out what piece you are looking for. The picture features lots of the characters from the Cars and Cars 2 movies in a race scene. The finished picture is great - very bright and colourful and full of action. In my opinion this is a great puzzle for a 3-4 year old. It encourages concentration and patience and also hand-eye coordination. Thoroughly recommended."
13215,4093,5," My 4 year old son loves this and can put it together in 10 minutes& then he takes it apart and does it again... he spends hours everyday doing this puzzle& its the best puzzle i have ever bought for him. Very fast delivery as well& really pleased."
13216,4093,5," What a fabulous jigsaw! If you want to keep your little ones engrossed for a while& buy this. My grandson is into Cars in a big way& and he really loves this and can make it in about 10 minutes."
13217,4093,5," An excellent buy. 4 jigsaw puzzles graded for difficulty. My 3 year old grandson who is passionate about Cars& soon got the idea of the differing sizes of pieces - ie larger pieces = easier puzzle etc -  very quickly. The pictures on each puzzle thrilled him and the pieces themselves were quite robust. Good for helping develop concentration& patience and perseverence. Very good value."
13218,4093,5," Once again Ravensburger have come up trumps for their puzzles for the younger children.  Disney Cars 2 has a  bright and colourful picture to capture the attention of the child.  The pieces are large and my grandchildren aged 5 just love it.Ravensburger Disney Cars 2 XXL Jigsaw Puzzle (100 Pieces)"
13219,4093,5," Bought this for our 2 year old son and it's one of his favourites.  The pieces are a good size for small hands and are quite sturdy.  A good variety of colours makes it easier to match the pieces. He can complete it on his own but presents more of a challenge than 50 piece jigsaws."
13220,4093,5," This jigsaw works really well as they are so many different cars in the picture you are able to do little pieces and then put it all together. A great first big jigsaw for 5 year old stepping away from the 3-5 year old jigsaws."
13221,4093,5," Bought this puzzle for the folks at a retirement home& where it's proved popular. The separate colours are easy to see and the XXL pieces are easy to handle. With only 100 pieces& the jigsaw doesn't take too long to complete."
13222,4094,5," Gave the puzzle as a present the person was very pleased with it would buy from these people again"
13223,4095,5," It arrived on time. Looks great& it's a Christmas present& so we will see how they get on."
13224,4096,5," Good jigsaw very detailed and value for money...not too hard but tasking and my 5 year old mananged with a little help....would recommend this supplier."
13225,4096,4," Plenty of fun&  child of 3 well entertained"
13226,4096,5," Really& good sturdy jigsaw. Challenging enough for my 6 year old (who is very adept at them) while not being so difficult that it was off putting for her."
13227,4097,5," Great."
13228,4098,5," I really enjoyed doing these two jigsaws& they are colourful and well made and& being a cat lover& just ideal for me!  I was going to save them for Christmas& but I weakened and opened them early!"
13229,4098,4," Good quality as you would expect from Ravensburger.  Usually go for 1000 pieces so this was a bit different for me.  Ideal if you havn't much time to spare.Things of interest throughout the puzzles and the finished product made me smile."
13230,4098,5," My8 yr old grand daughter loved this puzzle but needed help to complete it.The puzzle with the single cat was quite hard because of a large amount of fur."
13231,4098,5," If you love cats you'll love this. Lovely delineated design& detail and colour. Good picture composition and the art work was refined."
13232,4099,5," Very well made and durable& with a lovely clear photo. The pieces are quite big too which makes them easier to handle."
13233,4099,5," I have found in the past that Ravensburger puzzles are well made and fit together really well. This product held up to the Ravensbuger name. The colours are bright and the picture is very cute. My six year old daughter was able to complete the puzzle by herself with a little thought."
13234,4099,5," Bought for 81 year old lady who has recently had a stroke.  Lovely large pieces& easy to handle& and at 100 pieces not too taxing. Lovely picture."
13235,4099,5," I bought for my mother-in-law who has dementia. She wouldn't be able to do it on her own but took an interest in helping. 100 pieces seems ideal as doesn't take too long to complete and the pieces are strong. Not a bad price either and doesn't look like a kids jigsaw like some. Would recommend and would buy this brand again."
13236,4099,4," My five year old loves kittens and puzzles.  This combines those loves in a really beautifully made quality puzzle with chunky durable pieces in a good solid box.  It has 100 pieces but the style of picture will make it a challenge to complete."
13237,4099,5," Love ravensburger jigsaws they are such good quality my granddaughter loved the picture as it was a photo picture rather than a drawing."
13238,4099,5," Chose this for a gift for my granddaughter. It was sent to USA and arrived on time and in good condition.It suited her age."
13239,4099,3," Nice size jigsaw my 6 year old loved doing itKept her good for an hourQuick service"
13240,4100,4," Good value for money and I buy these for my mum who is housebound and it also keeps her mind active.Thanks."
13241,4100,4," Great characters - plenty of |puzzling| but interesting topic made for a very enjoyable puzzle."
13242,4100,4," Enjoyed doing this puzzle. I will certainly look out for others in this series."
13243,4100,5," Quite tricky& but time consuming. Enjoyed the puzzle."
13244,4101,5," The jigsaw has some unusual shapes in it& such as a little christmas tree and a cracker.Great jigsaw but quite difficult to make& it took me and my 9 year old daughter hours and hours to do!"
13245,4101,5," We did this over the Christmas break and thoroughly enjoyed watching it take shape.  Some of the pieces are in the shape of Christmassy objects (trees bells baubles etc) which made it more interesting.  Lots going on in the picture so everyone enjoyed building up their favourite bit.  Took us quite a few days to complete as it wasn't a quick and easy puzzle."
13246,4101,5," For Jigsaw lovers and for those who love Christmas scenes in particular& this puzzle is ideal. It's difficult without being impossible. I thoroughly enjoyed completing this puzzle as it's a good all rounder."
13247,4101,5," Was easy to do so we all joined in and it was lovely having our on-going jigsaw sitting there for all to do over the holidays. Quick delivery and well packaged. Ordered a bit late so very pleased to get it."
13248,4101,5," Present for my mother who collects these and she loves the vibrant colours. Well made jigsaws."
13249,4102,5," Really pleased with this puzzle would like to try more puzzles like this one."
13250,4103,5," Looks to be a well produced puzzle& though not yet tried."
13251,4104,4," I bought this for my Mothers' 82nd Birthday because she loves anything concerning tigers& the 3D effect is amazing& it is almost as if the tiger is about to pounce out at you.Taking it apart and re-assembling is a challenge because the picture on each piece changes as you move them to different angles& and as each piece is the same rectangular shape and size finding the correct positition for them is interesting to say the least.If you want to keep the kids (or your 82 yr old Mother) occupied for a while& I would recommend this puzzle& or one similar to it."
13252,4104,4," I bought this puzzle for my 8 year-old son and he instantly loved it.  It is very eye-catching and quite difficult to put together.  It kept him entertained for about 15-20min.  I would recommend this for any 5-9 year-olds who enjoy playing with puzzles."
13253,4104,5," The 3D effect of this tiger is really life like as if its moving and when granddaughter recived it as a xmass present she was thrilled very happy"
13254,4104,5," Cheatwell games 3D puzzles are always enjoyed by children of all ages& the Tiger one and Fox ones were particularily good."
13255,4104,5," I had the Meerkat one as a present from granddaughter. So I checked online for others.Love Tigers so bought one"
13256,4105,5," Lovely puzzle to do& lovely colours and lots of interest. It was bought for me to pass my time& as at the moment I am home with a broken leg.The puzzle was brand new& Completely sealed& Unfortunately there. Was ONE piece missing& top right hand corner.  must have been missingat manufacture. Annoying but still a good puzzLe."
13257,4106,5," I love House of Puzzles jigsaws - the varied shapes of the pieces make them more interesting to do.  Haven't actually started this one yet& but my husband and I are looking forward to it."
13258,4107,2," product ok but box was a bit beaten and flimsy so when it arrived and all the contents had fell out so didn't really look new!"
13259,4107,5," Great little set. Was brought as a present for a 3 year old and he loved it! Would highly recommend!"
13260,4107,3," Arrived a little bumped and bashed but was only the box so all in all it was a good product."
13261,4107,5," Brilliant product& arrived a lot quicker than initially expected"
13262,4107,4," Came within estimated delivery time. Looks good value for money"
13263,4108,5," This product was a Christmas present and the recipient was very happy and has already completed the jigsaw. Thank you."
13264,4109,5," I like it"
13265,4110,1," Arrived quickly.....however& when we opened it there were 5 corners! And then when we finished it we realised that there was a edge piece missing& and 5 duplicates! Not impressed really. Such a shame when it is a nice jigsaw. Ruined it for us. ðŸ˜”"
13266,4110,5," first class service and product."
13267,4110,5," best prices good quality"
13268,4110,5," Fantastic thank you"
13269,4111,5," I got this as a stocking filler for my 8 year old. He already knew the scene as it is taken from a Where's Wally book. The 250 pieces were just the right amount to challenge him a little but also to let him finish the puzzle within an hour. Previously we had bought a 100 piece Wally jigsaw in alocal child's toy shop but it proved way too difficult for him. This was an enjoyable diversion. His older sisters built it again later in the day. Good for a gift for a Wally fan or a rainy day stand by."
13270,4111,4," If you know | where's wally| then you know what to expect from this puzzle. I bought it for my 6 year old son. He was capable of doing it on his own but it was more fun doing it together. Lots of Wally detail to look at as you build up the picture. The dissapointment came with the quality of the board& fairly thin cardboard that is not going to stand up to much."
13271,4111,5," Great puzzle& the whole family got involved so good couple of hours fun. Nothing more to say& so will I make it to the required word count - did not realise it would feel like an assignment"
13272,4111,4," If your kid likes Wheres Wally and jigsaw puzzles its a perfect time filler for kids . Quite hard for him at first & but my 7 yr old eventually finished it ."
13273,4112,5," This is our third Clementoni jigsaw. All of them are extremely high quality and are challenging but great fun."
13274,4113,5," A good challenge."
13275,4113,5," really good"
13276,4113,5," no problem"
13277,4113,5," Great"
13278,4113,5," good"
13279,4114,5," Great quality print& board and fit of pieces. My wife loves this and finds it easier than expected but still a challenge. Hours of enjoyment."
13280,4115,5," This Jigsaw is fantastic and very unusual. It certatinly looks like a huge box of roses and made me smile when it arrived.Not just a boring jigsaw  puzzle&someting a bit different and entertaining for any chocolate lover!!!!"
13281,4115,5," I bought this for my 85year old mum& and she said it was quite difficult& but once she picked out the colours& it was easy to complete. Would recommend for any age group."
13282,4115,5," This really caught out the lucky recipient with a December birthday who thought they had just received a familiar-shaped carton of chocs...which...satisfyingly& kept them puzzling for the rest of the year!It is a good quality 500-piece jigsaw& mainly of regular-shaped pieces with just a few other shapes added in the mix.  You could be forgiven for thinking with the colours and the words that this would make up in next to no time but with some â€˜Rosesâ€™ upside down& it was harder than expected.There were no problems with poor quality or missing pieces in my box"
13283,4115,5," Looking forward to finding the time to sit down& relax and do this puzzle! Bought two as wanted one as a Christmas present.  Very original!"
13284,4115,4," Enjoyed this jigsaw& quiet easy to do with patients. When I seen thought it was rather expensive but was a nice gift with novelty value."
13285,4115,5," I bought this as an Xmas present so I couldn't comment on how good the jigsaw itself is& but it's a great novelty gift and I hope the recipient thinks it's just as great as I do. I am hoping she takes notice when she opens it or it'll get packed into the sweetie cupboard :D"
13286,4115,5," I sent it to my sister who has a broken knee so is stuck for things she can do at the moment...she loved it as it was fun but quite difficult so wasn't too quick to finish! I am going to order her the jelly bean one next!"
13287,4115,4," Ithought this would be good christmas day entertainment but it is complex and difficult - therefore children not interestedExcellent but for the enthusiast"
13288,4116,5," not yet done as i have several new ones to do& but falcon are very good& next to ravensburger for quality looking forward to doing it"
13289,4116,5," lovely puzzle"
13290,4117,5," Arrived in perfect condition.The puzzle is made of really good quality. Very fun and educational!My kid always bends puzzle pieces& which end up peeling off& but because this one is really thik& it is very hard to bend.Excellent value for money!"
13291,4117,5," very good quality& my children love to play with those puzzles! excellent gift for any occasion! I would recommend to anyone."
13292,4117,5," I have bought this for my daughter who is only 3 and learning to count at the moment& and it is very educational! *thumbs up*"
13293,4118,5," Very good"
13294,4119,4," Good quality board& tricky cut shapes& interlocking pieces held together firmly& nice quality of print and a lovely picture when completed."
13295,4119,5," Unbelievably difficult to do took ages but so worth it"
13296,4120,5," I've become a big fan of the Ravensburger 3D landmark series and have bought most of them by now& and will probably keep on going.Unlike the Big Ben and Eiffel Tower models& the Leaning Tower of Pisa has no hinged pieces& and is made up entirely of curved pieces. It's a lot easier to put together& maybe the easiest of the set& but it is also the one that works best as a traditional jigsaw - i.e. judging what goes where by the pattern rather than by the numbers on the back of the pieces.I've read a couple of reviews of models in this series that complain about the numbers on the back of the pieces& as if that somehow makes it less of a puzzle. To my mind& the numbering actually increases the challenge as there are a number of pieces that are identically shaped and could fit in a few different places& so making sure it all fits together in the right order takes longer and is therefore a way of increasing the value for money.It also has in its favour the best stand of the landmarks series - rather than tabs that are too small to hold the model securely on a cardboard base& you build it around a sturdy plastic base& and it's not going to fall over at the slightest knock& as the others are prone to.The plastic pieces all fit together so well that once assembled it is absolutely smooth and works well as a traditional model for displaying."
13297,4120,5," Great game and was a lot of fun for granddaughter. Very good quality puzzle that comes with a sturdy display stand. Overall very happy with the puzzle and the seller."
13298,4120,5," Very good quality puzzle/model. My 10 year old put this together in about 30 minutes using the numbers on the back of the pieces. It's too hard to put together without the numbers but very easy using them. This one was much easier than Big Ben. Looks great when it's finished."
13299,4120,5," Was a birthday present for a family member& after looking everywhere it was nice to find this model on here. It was cheap and arrived perfectly in time too."
13300,4120,5," good value am sure they will be well received& thanks have bought Big Ben"
13301,4120,5," Really good quality& i expected it to be foam but the pieces are actually plastic and they all fit very well and the actual finished product is very sturdy.Great fun and looks great!"
13302,4120,5," This puzzle was for my 10 year old daughter who was keep busy doing it.  Even though it looks difficult she managed to do it by herself and didn't take ages& so didn't get bored."
13303,4120,1," This took my 12 year old son about 30 minutes& as each piece appears to have a number on it that tells you where it goes.Â£19.99 for 30 minutes and now it's in the garage."
13304,4121,5," Oh dear the Judge has made his decision and the blonde with the poodle has won  the Best in Show- but was it for her doggies's good looks or hers??These jigsaw puzzles are marvelous because the puzzle is not the picture that is shown on the box but is a 'what will happen next'You use the box to help you identify what the figures are wearing and bit by bit the picture takes its form..I won't give away what the final picture is but it made us all laugh.And you will have fun getting there.The Jigsaw is well cut& the 150 pieces are a good fit and robust.What is good about this jigsaw is that at just 150 pieces it can be tacked by children  and is easily completed in just one night&BUT it is a puzzle and I had to rejig quite a few bits before the solution was reached!!If you are an expert or someone who loves a challenge then I suggest you seek out the many 1000 piece ones.But these 150 piece jobs have a lot of things going for them when you can solve a puzzle that is a challenge in a couple of hours.Try it BUTOnce you do one you will come back and buy more htese Jigsaws are terribly addictive and I gurantee that you will talk about them to all and sundry.If you meet a fellow enthusiast - then you will have hours of conversational fun- I kid you not!Â¬For those who like a challenge there are 500 and 1000 piece versions of the same jigsaw.I envy your journey!!"
13305,4122,5," Great puzzle for kids - came on time and was well packaged. Can't wait to give this to my niece for Christmas."
13306,4122,5," look great but not opened yet as its for christmas. hopefully it will bw brill."
13307,4123,5," I am really forward to doing this puzzle especially now the new film is out concerning the actual painting.I did have a look to check that the piecesare cut through.Lots of gold!"
13308,4124,4," This is an excellent jigsaw puzzle.The only criticism is of the site. There does not appear to be a search facility for the different ranges of puzzles: ie up to 1000"
13309,4124,5," Bought this a while ago for long rainy days. Personally& I am a big fan of puzzles and this one here is a real challenge."
13310,4124,5," Great Puzzle! My Wife Loves It! Recommended Seller! Thanks! A+++++!!!"
13311,4124,4," Loved the picture. Good variety of pieces& and quite challenging. But got to the end and found that there is ONE piece missing. Of course& not sure if it is our fault of that of manufacturer& but it has certainly spoiled a very good effort."
13312,4125,5," I love all things Rosina Wachtmeister and was thrilled to find this puzzle.  I haven't done it yet as I am taking it to Spain to do over Christmas but it shall certainly enjoy it.  It arrived well packed and on time.  Cannot fault service in any way."
13313,4125,5," Gorgeous jigsaw& with a fantastic pretty colourful design and high quality cut. I've just finished it& and it was a delight to do."
13314,4125,5," Very beautiful cat&in very pretty colours&came in perfect condition and we spent a few very happy hours making it!"
13315,4125,5," Great fun"
13316,4126,5," Kept my son in law happily occupied for the whole of Christmas although he found it frustrating so many pieces of tree looked the same!"
13317,4127,5," Nicely made jigsaw that has smaller pieces than many others thus allowing this larger piece one to fit on the dining room table.The pieces do not interlock as firmly as some jigsaws but the pieces are not as thick - i doubt all the pieces would ft in the box if it was. This does not distract from the jigsaw and is stated as fact rather than criticism.I consider myself quite good at jigsaws and this one is a real challenge. The smaller pieces (with less of an image to work with) and the fact that you can fit a piece that seems perfect only to realise its wrong makes this a pleasantly challenging experience.It has taken me just over 13 hours to complete the sky and centre to right mountains!  I am building up to the trees!Devilishly difficult at times but highly enjoyable& that satisfaction of fitting one piece after an hours searching.A real jigsawers jigsaw!"
13318,4127,5," a wonderful puzzle& with a vista that is outstandingly depicted& recommended!!"
13319,4127,5," Arrived promptly and great quality as previous ones I have purchased were"
13320,4128,4," First of  all& the quality is superb& as I would expect from Ravensburger. But I advise against buying this puzzle if you don't even like cupcakes! It will make you hungry& and frustrated& as so many of the cake toppings are very similar and there are ever SUCH a lot of them. |Perplexing| implies an above-average level of difficulty& and I won't be getting one of these perplexing puzzles again. Quite seriously& I'm only 51 but I had to order a magnifying glass with LEDs to complete this puzzle& so minute were the details. This glass came from China& and took three about weeks& so the whole jigsaw puzzle experience took  two months instead of two days. By the time I had finished& I was no longer on holiday in Cornwall in a rainy caravan& but back at work in Gloucestershire& with six additional grey hairs.Finally& there are absolutely no mountains& birds& nor holiday scenes (unless you count thoughts of village bake sales) in this image. Completing it wasn't in the least relaxing.I did& however& manage to teach myself some basic Polish phrases on an audio course while doing the puzzle& so my time was not entirely wasted. Should I ever find myself accidentally transported to Warsaw& I will be suitably equipped."
13321,4128,4," I purchase Ravensburger puzzles for my very elderly mother - she loves them.  She has done many of their puzzles and this is the only one that she has given up on - it really does take a lot of patience and perhaps someone with 100% eyesight for this particular puzzle.  It does actually tell you on the box that it's |tantalizing| and |challenging|..... and it is.."
13322,4128,5," Bought this for my daughter in law for a bit of fun as she loves making cup cakes& brought a smile to her face christmas morning"
13323,4128,5," Very enjoyable puzzle. Plenty of pieces could be part of multiple cupcakes so this gives a bit of a challenge. Cupcakes did look delicious and the puzzle took just over 3 hours which is a long time for a 500pc puzzle& so good value for money. Plenty of different textures and colours however so by no means impossible."
13324,4128,5," great value for money keeps you busy for ages&makes you feel hungry as cakes very lifelike.good puzzle to do for fans"
13325,4128,4," Nice jigsaw for a cupcake fan& not too easy and not too hard& Ravensburger are always good jigsaws. Can recommend"
13326,4128,5," What a great puzzle! As always with Ravensburger a good quality puzzle with a super picture on."
13327,4129,5," I wanted a board I could balance on my knees.  All the ones I saw in shops were far too flimsy.This one is made of solid wood completely covered in 'felt' which really grips the jigsaw.  I've had the board almost upright and the puzzle didn't move& so it could feasibly be used in bed.  The felt under the board is designed to prevent scratches on a table& but I find it also helps to stop the board from slipping off my trousered knees.It comfortably holds all the 500 piece puzzles I& personally& possess but if you have any particular favourites size will matter so you may want to check measurements which are& on the flat working space inside the rim& 52 x 40 cm.Pricey& but could well last a lifetime."
13328,4129,5," I enjoy being able to move around when doing jigsaws and not stuck to one place.  This board is lightweight but firm and holds pieces in place when moved from chair to chair or room to room.  It is great to have on one's lap in a relaxed fashion& or on a table if you prefer that.  You may think I love this board.  You'd be right.  I can't fault it."
13329,4129,5," I bought this for my aunt as she is not well and has to spend a lot of time sat in her chair.  This board is just the right size and not too big it fits nicely on her knee is just the right size it does not slip around due to the covering.  The jigsaw pieces stay in place too."
13330,4129,5," Excellent product. Needed to be lightweight. Would recommend this for anyone who wants to leave the puzzle out but gives easy portability from one place to another"
13331,4129,2," Not very impressed. Firstly the board arrived with a large crack through the centre which I suspect may have happened in transit. Secondly& after reading all the info about the product& I was disappointed to receive what was a piece of chipboard with a velour covering. The leaflets inside showed lovely boards with fold over covers and other features& none of which this product had. An expensive waste of money and I would definitely not recommend."
13332,4129,5," My Jigboard arrived 2 days after order was placed and I'm very pleased with purchase. I had purchased a puzzle board before but find this one so easy to use and has encouraged me to enjoy puzzles again. It's easy to move round house and puzzle mat keeps pieces in place when not in use. Will be ordering a 1000 piece size later ðŸ˜ƒ"
13333,4129,5," I love doing puzzles but due to an arthritic back I can only manage small puzzles now and this board is ideal. Nice"
13334,4130,5," The item came promptly and my dad really enjoyed it& he said wit was quite tricky to do& but a lot of fun."
13335,4131,5," Very happy with this. It will make a great Christmas present for my puzzle enthusiast friend! (Obviously I haven't opened it though)."
13336,4131,5," spot on happy"
13337,4132,5," My 3 year old loves this puzzle. He breaks it down by character or by edges and middle. The pieces are good quality and robust& and the completed jigsaw fits in the box."
13338,4132,5," my five year old loves jigsaws and was not disappointed with this item"
13339,4133,5," Ciro Marchetti Circus Procession is a wonderful painting that I never get bored of.Every time I view it I see tiny details that I had missed before.For example the cat viewing the stars through a telescope- the details and variety of the birds and so on.But all this art is combined in this fabulous jigsaw By Schmidt.In the past I have said that there are jigsaws and there are quality jigsaws and this one screams quality from the off.Firstly the art  by Ciro Marchetti as I say above is stunning. Jewel Bright and amazing.Next is the construction.The pieces fit really well thanks to an expensive quality die cutting.Each piece fits really well and there is no confusion over whether a piece fits or not because each is individual and to a premium cut.The card is premium and thick.No looses edges nor dust about like some cheaper ones.The surface is matt so there is non of that annoying reflection that makes the puzzle more of a chore rather than a joy.Most people do puzzles with indoor lights and the reflections are cancelled out.Result. You can concentrate on selecting the pieces.Now where the jigsaw takes your breath away is that once pieced together you can& with confidence pick the whole thing up without â€˜need of any puzzle conserverâ€™ in other words no pieces will separate and fall.It has a linen effect& is varnished and that matt finish means it is brilliant for mounting for display.The final thing must be the price.For a jigsaw of this quality and build you would expect to pay three times the price and still consider it a sound buy.Totally one hundred per cent recommended.Total Quality From Start To Finish."
13340,4133,5," I agree with other reviewers that the image is quite dark when completed& but it has lovely& intriguing details and I would buy another Ciro Marchetto puzzle as his artwork is fascinating. You can imagine your own fantasy world while working on it. I found the puzzle easy to do as the pieces can be separated out to work on the very distinct sections and each piece only seems to go in its own unique place. The fit between the pieces is not as tight as it is with other brands (e.g. Ravensburger) so it is not easy to move sections about. A fabulous jigsaw."
13341,4133,3," I have another puzzle from the same artist. Always detailed& beautiful and magical.The reason for the average review this time: Schmidt puzzles are usually of good quality& but the one I received has misshaped pieces. Some are badly bent and one piece has a big imprint in the middle so it isn't flat (I imagine this is from the disassembly process after the cutting). Have they changed the production process? Or is it a one-time fault? I don't know. I will have to return the product and will update here if there is the same problem on the next one I receive."
13342,4133,5," Rich colours and a wealth of detail make this beautiful puzzle a joy to complete. I didn't want to break it up! Fast delivery."
13343,4133,4," Hard to do and dark"
13344,4133,4," Very good puzzle& my only comppaint is it was very dark."
13345,4133,4," Just bought this and it's more graphical than the picture so now we are going to buy the rest if the collection"
13346,4134,5," another brillant puzzle"
13347,4134,5," we love it"
13348,4134,5," Looking forward to starting it"
13349,4135,4," House of Puzzles produce some beautiful puzzles& but this one (or rather my copy) again suffers from not having been perfectly cut. Extra backing cardboard sticking to pieces can become really irritating."
13350,4136,4," My mum loved it."
13351,4137,5," The White Mountain puzzles are excellent value&the pieces are large& well defined and the puzzle fits together well. Also their subject matter is instructive which is an added bonus.They are a little expensive as they are an American company but the extra cost is well worth it in terms of enjoyment given"
13352,4137,5," lovely jigsaw"
13353,4138,3," I ordered this for a boys birth party my son was invited to& and was really disapointed at how small it was. please note it's 7cm in diameter when put together. It came in the tiniest box ever! I had to buy another pressy cos it looked so little!!!My son was with friend when he put it together and he said looks quite good but small!!!I hope you find this info useful& wish i'd of known& as I would have opted for the 90 pc or 120 pc ones!"
13354,4138,4," Excellent quality product& my son happily made it and now displays it proudly in his bedroom."
13355,4138,4," We bought this jigsaw because my 6 year old son is mad about Ben 10 and he enjoys putting jigsaws together.  We thought this would be something different to the usual flat ones.It was a lot smaller than we expected but that wasn't a problem.  My son enjoyed putting it together but found the last few pieces difficult to do.  It seems quite strong and is now sitting above the fire place!"
13356,4138,3," ordered as a Christmas present for my son so haven't actually used product yet& but the box it has come in is very small& so not sure how big the actual puzzle is going to be.  The box is also damaged& although I don't think the puzzle inside is.  Given the price& including packaging it could be over priced!!"
13357,4139,4," Haven't opened it as its a Christmas present.  It does appear well made and I'm sure my granddaughter will love it"
13358,4140,3," I bought the first |collector's set|& not realizing that what I was purchasing was the BOX IMAGES of the old Wasgij puzzles& and not the actual original wasgij puzzles.  Those older puzzles are hard to find in mint condition on ebay& and their packaging could use an update. Even the piece quality is better now than it was early on.  I wish Jumbo would rerelease those first Wasgij puzzles in new packaging& and I'd hoped that's what these new 'collector sets' were.  But no& what you get are 3 puzzles of **the old box images**.  In other words& there is no wasgij element to these.  There is no mystery about what the puzzle image is.To me& that's the whole point of a wasgij -- not knowing what the puzzle image is. If you like the box images enough to want to do a puzzle of them& then this set is a good deal. But if you were hoping for a re-release of the original Wasgij puzzles& as I was& don't be fooled. This isn't it.I'm putting this review up because I noticed on the first set many other reviewers were fooled and disappointed that the puzzles were NOT the original wasgij images. I hope to spare anyone else the same mistake on this set."
13359,4140,2," Oh Dear&I am totally in agreement with my fellow reviewer Mr Holmes.These 3 jigsaws seem a little bit pointless and do not deserve the name WASGIJ?Let me make myself clear on this.Wasgij make really good jigsaws.BUTThe selling point and their whole reason for being so enjoyable is that they have a twist.The name WASGIJ gives a clue it is of course Jigsaw backwards.Now with a Wasgij you have to guess what is coming in the case of The Keen Gardener who has used a tad too powerful flower feed from the point of view looking back.In the case of the Marriage Photograph why is the groom looking so shocked and who exactly is aproaching (IT would be BIG oF Me to tell you  but why bother. The picture on the box is the one you have to complete?The whole point of the jigsaws is discovering these facts& getting the jokes that come fast and furious as they are gradually revealed as you solve the jigsaws.THIS IS NOT the case for these three.Just like volume 1Wasgij Limited Edition Original Collector's Box Jigsaw Puzzles (1000 Pieces/ Pack of 3)what you get is the actual pictures thus defeating the whole point of a WASGIJ.Fine if you like Jigsaws pointless if you are a Wasgij fan.The box clearly states 'the box images you have waiting to puzzle'Not for me they haven't!I wonder why they released this as a celebration?It is like a broken pencil.(pointless- Edmund Blackadder)Now all is not lost these are fine jigsaws to complete and they are very well made. The art work is attractive but as I said the whole extra joy that a Wasgij gives you is missing and that is one of the major attractions."
13360,4140,4," I obviously didn't read the other reviews as I too expected true Wasjigs. The puzzles are good still so have kept us amused. But the boxes are small so the pictures are small. Very hard to see picture detail& ended up taking a photo on my phone and zooming in."
13361,4140,5," Brilliant puzzles& great characters and detail and really funny when you look closely at exactly what is going on. They kept us amused during a very long wet winter in Greece"
13362,4140,5," I love Wasgij puzzles - to get 3 together is a great deal.  Quality is excellent& despatched and received quickly."
13363,4140,1," Not the usual Wasgij format.i understood that all wasgijs had a twist hence the name."
13364,4140,5," First rate& i have not sen the early wasgijs and this is very good value for money"
13365,4140,5," good quality jigsaws as always. Individual storage boxes for the 3 jigsaws"
13366,4141,5," Brilliant puzzle with all different shapes especially the edges. Lots of different colour browns for the teddies fur!!!!"
13367,4142,5," Yay! Two new Ravensburger |What If?| puzzles just popped up on amazon. I love this series and have the first six. They're great quality& of course& with nice thick pieces& good fit& and bright colors. But I particularly love the imagination in these |What If?| puzzles -- the puzzle you put together is not the box image but a 'what if' idea based on the box image. In this case -- What if Da Vinci had never painted the Mona Lisa?  These are great fun to work and I highly recommend the whole series.  (If you are familar with wasgij& these are very similar& and I love that series too& but Ravensburger wins the prize for gorgeous packaging and fun images.)"
13368,4142,4," I love quirky jigsaw puzzles.  The only ones to top the |What if| series would be Wasgij puzzles&.As a senior citizen& I look for ways to keep my brain active"
13369,4142,5," These puzzles are the best ever. Top quality product with lovely bright colours and interesting pictures. Definitely worth buying. Can't wait for more to be produced."
13370,4142,5," Great product (if you like Wasgij you will love this series)Delivery time was excellent. Packaged very well."
13371,4142,5," Love these jigsaws! I've bought lots of them. Good price& excellent quality"
13372,4142,5," Excellent jigsaw.  Have completed all in the series so far and look forward to next one."
13373,4142,5," Seemed simple enough but turned out reasonable difficult  - as ever really entertaining"
13374,4142,5," All Ravensburger jigsaws are good but I really enjoy their 'What If' series"
13375,4143,4," Bought as a gift. Appears as described"
13376,4143,5," Good for the who le family"
13377,4144,5," Just what I wanted.  Memories of holidays in Blackpool will return piece by piece.  Excellent service& goods were received very quickly and were as described.  Thank you."
13378,4144,5," jigsawi thought this item was very good. it took about two days to build it. it is a good item"
13379,4144,5," Always buy Ravensburger JIgsaws pieces always fit without forcing them in - Love this picture just finished it. Would buy again from this seller. Came very Quickly Good solid Packaging Top Marks here."
13380,4144,5," Lovely puzzle and a happy memory picture. Relatively quick and easy to do. Popular with friends and relatives - it must have been completed in about a dozen homes by now - therefore very good value!!"
13381,4144,5," I really enjoyed doing this puzzle"
13382,4144,5," This is my second purchase in the Ravensburger series of the Happy Days range& easy to complete with nice colours."
13383,4144,5," He has really enjoyed doing the jigsaw and the picture is fun.  Myself and my Dad are happy with this product."
13384,4144,5," best puzzle very good I will always by ravensburger"
13385,4145,5," It was a great trip down memory lane to see these vehicles gathered in one place albeit in jigsaw form.  I'm old enough to remember seeing most of these great vehicles used for real.  The jigsaw itself has again been well produced by House of Puzzles.  If you enjoy completing jigsaws then you should like this one."
13386,4145,5," Good provider& no problems."
13387,4145,5," Excellent puzzle"
13388,4146,5," Bought a few 3D puzzles. This one was for my 17yr old Son for Xmas. He loved it& started doing it almost as soon as He opened it. He loved doing it and was over the moon when He finished. Would very much recommend this item. And so glad i ordered it. Brilliant& simple as that."
13389,4146,4," Well constructed and relatively easy to put together. Very good end product& realistic. Not good with rough handling - to be looked at rather than played with."
13390,4146,5," I have never bought any similar product& so I was a little bit worried after reading some bad reviews& but I am certainly glad that I bought this cathedral. It comes in quite a small box& but cathedral is quite big once assembled. My daughter just turned 9& so I had to help her with putting together some parts (especially roof of dome). I wanted to spend some quality time with my daughter& so it was a perfect present for both of us. I think I loved assembling it as much as she did. I am definitely going to buy more similar products. It is educational and fun& but would not recommend for kids under 9& as they would get bored with it& as parent would have to do most work."
13391,4146,5," along with the others produced you need patience& but they are fun to put togetherI have recommended them to others and find them theraputic"
13392,4146,4," This is definitely worth the money. Spent a good two hours with my nephew building this up. Some problems with the cathedral dome in that some of the tabs do not match the holes - but easily fixed by ignoring those tabs (fold those in). Ensure you work it in steps - do not remove the parts in advance& as they are not number marked. The numbers are only on the template. Use a small screwdriver for harder to fit tabs."
13393,4146,5," Excellent! Builds into an accurate"
13394,4146,3," The Item itself once built looks ok& but on closer inspection nothing is flush& I had a bit of bother with the section below the two front towers. The instructions were ok but not clear sometimes. Still pleased with the item though."
13395,4146,5," It's very good& my son loved and built it in about 3 hours. With some help but not much!The materials are light and quite resistant& doesn't break easily.You just can't rebuild as numbers willl be gone once you do it. It's just for once and keep built!"
13396,4147,5," A great gift for jigsaw lovers - good price too"
13397,4148,5," A successful gift& much appreciated."
13398,4148,5," A present for Christmas"
13399,4149,5," Brought this for my friend for xmas and she loved it"
13400,4149,5," Very good very hard but we did it"
13401,4149,5," tricky"
13402,4150,5," This is one of a set of four..Really good fun to do. Excellent quality& andwonderfully bright colours.So not so muchstrain on the eyes."
13403,4150,5," This puzzle& like all Ravensburger puzzles& is addictive.  Don't leave it out or you will not be able to resist doing a bit more every time you pass it!  Spoils you for other makes of puzzle."
13404,4150,5," I recieced my jigsaw in perfect condition& which I am going to enjoy makeing buying on line is better than going to the shop plus you get more choice."
13405,4150,5," Same good quality you expect from Ravensburger.  It is good fun to watch the picture emerge and try and imagine what it will look like at the end."
13406,4150,5," This new series is very promising. Great quality and really good fun. If you like Wasgijs you will love these @What if' jigsaws."
13407,4150,5," As always Ravensburger puzzle's have come up trumps always good quality and a brilliant fun picture& I loved doing this one"
13408,4150,5," This puzzle was an absolute dream to do& I didnot stop laughing while I was doing it. The colours were very bold and clear and easy to fit. It was a bit of a challenge as the picture was not the same as the box but that was the idea of 'what if' still very enjoyable."
13409,4150,5," Not only is the quality of this Ravensburger puzzle exceptional but the content is brilliant. What a very clever concept. 10 out of 10 for all aspects. A definite |must buy| for puzzle fans."
13410,4151,5," I enjoyed doing this puzzle but it did not take me long to do. Good quality pieces and the delivery was quick. Passed on to frinde to do"
13411,4151,5," I loved this jigsaw.  I was looking for some nice 500 piece puzzles that would be enjoyable to do without being overly difficult and this fit the bill.  I have others in the range 'Happy Days at Work' and thought I'd give this a go too.It was a lovely puzzle to do& great colours and a wonderful nostalgic scene to complete.  The jigsaw is great quality and I've completed it a few times without any loss in quality.  I'd happily recommend this and the other 'Happy Days at Work' jigsaws."
13412,4151,5," Ravensburger Jigs are always good value"
13413,4151,5," Typical Ravensburger quality of material& print and cut.A real joy to do - not a 'hard' puzzle but a gentle and reallypleasurable way to while away 3-4 hours'100% recommended"
13414,4151,5," Puzzle is very good it took a couple of days to do well made puzzles well worth the money I paid from this seller good delivery and would buy again when needing a puzzle."
13415,4151,5," This is a very nice puzzle.  It took me three days to do the puzzle. I am well impressed with the puzzle. I would recommend the puzzle to other people!"
13416,4151,5," Ravensburger are definitely the best quality puzzles you can buy. They have dust free pieces and the colour and quality of the board it excellent"
13417,4151,5," Prompt delivery as usual and good value.  Brings back memories of days gone bye. Ravensburger puzzles are always good quality."
13418,4152,4," Arrived quickly and well packed. The quality of pieces is at least good. They fit very well without thinking twice if that is correct piece. No bits were missing. When finished I was able to lift like a carpet& which usually indicates good quality. If you like pieces that are very random in shapes like some of the Ravensburgers' if I remember well& then this is not the one. It has standard 1& 2& 3 and sometimes 4 'peg' pieces of standard shape. I think I would buy one again though."
13419,4152,5," Nice jigsaw to make"
13420,4152,5," Chuffed"
13421,4153,5," My daughter is 4 years now and like all little girls she loves Snowwhite so this was the perfect birthday present. The puzzle is good quality and we are happy with it."
13422,4153,4," Delivery on time. My niece really enjoyed doing the puzzle."
13423,4154,5," bought as a  present& went down a real treat& would highly recommend.great product!"
13424,4154,3," Looks ok bought as a gift so not opened yet. Looks a bit cheap"
13425,4154,5," Great Puzzle and brilliant shipping!"
13426,4154,5," fast delivery and perfect puzzle"
13427,4154,5," Thank you"
13428,4155,5," This seems as pictured by Amazon. I'm not an aviation history buff so I don't know what the colours on the wings and fuselage or the number 472035 signify. If anyone could enlighten me I'd be grateful.The scale is 1:72 which seems pretty standard for fighter aircraft in this series. Since most of the models I've purchased recently have been signed on the box collectors items& this is only the second one I have actually opened and examined more closely.We know the propellers are potentially fragile"
13429,4155,5," Bars all melted on delivery & probably the couriers fault & this spoiled these normally superb tasting bars"
13430,4155,4," Son loves it. Added it to his collection."
13431,4155,5," very good model"
13432,4156,5," Great model& just needs the main rotors fitting& I use poly cement to attach them to the rotor head"
13433,4156,5," Very good value for money and made a lovely gift for a military man that actually served on these type of helicopters"
13434,4156,5," This was bought for part of my sons christmas. he loves this and had to gegt a shelve up for his collection"
13435,4156,5," very pleased with this seaking good value for money and looks great"
13436,4156,5," Nice model"
13437,4157,3," A lovely reminder of the film& however disappointingly not metal& as the term |die-cast| certainly means to me& itis plastic and therefore expensive for what it is& i certainly wouldn't have brought it at this price if i had known it wasnt metal."
13438,4157,4," Bought these for our 4 year old nephews. They loved them even thought the movie isn't out yet! Arrived exactly on time& only  a day after ordering them. Lose one star because after ordering them from Amazon UK& I discovered they were TWICE the price charged for them at our local toy dept (in Australia). Don't know why& we usually find Amazon prices very reasonable."
13439,4157,2," The size of this toy is not as described.  The actual approx size is Width 12cm x Length 8cm x 2.5cm.  Not worth the money."
13440,4157,3," Definitely not worth the money paid for. Would not recommend. Even my 4 year old nephew looked disappointed with it."
13441,4157,3," It was very small& not all die cast as part plastic part metal. 4 year old son reaaly liked it."
13442,4157,2," IT COST Â£11.49 WHICH IS NEARLY DOUBLE THE COST OF IT IN TOYMASTER STORES. THEY ARE SELLING EXACTLY THE SAME PLANE AT Â£6.99. VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN RETURNING IT i WAS CHARGED Â£3.30"
13443,4157,5," This was a toy i bought for my son for xmas.  It came promtly and i was very pleased with packaging and fast delivery.  Value for money."
13444,4157,2," So small& not worth the price charged. If it was not what my nephew wanted for Xmas I would not have wasted my money on it."
13445,4158,5," This model is no longer available from Easy Models so if you want one you'd better move quick. This is a beautiful Zero and as usual with these particular ready to go  models it is well put together and finished to a high standard( better than the average kit builder).It arrived a day earlier than expected and in perfect condition."
13446,4159,5," Bought for my grandsons Christmas play in nursery&only problem we had was taking it off him he loves it&it is strong and well made costume."
13447,4160,5," Good price. Delivered well packaged and 5days after ordering. A good little plane that seems relatively robust considering the number of flying hours it has made & (and taxi-way accidents it has has with my vacuum cleaner). Perfect gift for aeroplane-mad child."
13448,4160,3," The toy is sturdy enough to avoid easy breakage but the written details and windows are actually printed on a sticker and not the plane itself& which would not be a problem if the sticker hasn't begun to peel already!!! And it's only a few weeks of infrequent use/play. Therefore& in my opinion& overpriced and do not recommend!"
13449,4160,5," ...no not me the recipient.After months of searching for this product was a godsend to find it here. Excellent delivery& good price and the new owner is very happily annoying the rest of the family with his toy."
13450,4160,5," Bought this for my 8yr old son who loves planes thee only thing was about it that the stand broke in the package but apart from that amazing!"
13451,4160,4," A great addition to my son's airport collection. Solid and good quality. Speedy delivery. We'll be looking for more airlines soon I'm sure."
13452,4160,4," arrived early &after a virgin holiday my grandson wanted a virgin plane and he is very pleased & thankyou"
13453,4160,5," Brilliant for  a 3 year old& wouldn't recommend as a model for adults"
13454,4160,5," This plane is probably the best toy I have ever bought for my son. He is so into planes. When I got this toy he beamed for hours. I have now bought more of them and now he practically has an airport! The models are really well made and the stickers/paint is very realistic and the plane is balanced well. This is really good toy to get if your son is into planes!"
13455,4161,5," Make sure you have a large shelf - coz its a big model. I was originally going to buy the die cast metal 1:200 scale A380& but I saw one in the Lufthansa shop at FRA. It had noticable joins on the side& so I decided on the resin version instead. This model is quiet weighty but the stand hold it quiet well. It comes with the gear down& and the overall detail is very good. If you want to be picky& the winglets are the wrong colour compared with the real thing& other than that ist a great model."
13456,4161,4," This is more of a model than a toy which is good. Went together in a few mins& nice detail and markings with engine fans which rotate& rubber tyres and rotating wheels making this a nice model..Phil."
13457,4161,5," Amazing! Looks exactly like the real thing! It is big so make sure you have room for it! The gram rolls like you would expect. It is made of plastic (very good quality) and metal so it has a good weight and feel to it! i would 100% recommend it!"
13458,4161,2," Great until you want to take it apart.I got the model as a gift and decided to display it with the landing gear. A few months later I decided I wanted to change it but the front landing gear fits so tightly into the model that when you try to remove them it snaps and breaks! Also you can't remove the tail without reasonably large amounts of force which could result in damage. I didn't risk it. I wanted to re box mine but couldn't due to the stuck landing gear and tail.Looks good though."
13459,4161,5," Excellent model& easy to put together& good size. Overall better than expected!"
13460,4162,5," As usual the Stobart trucks are excellent and this one is to their usual high standard - well made and attractive."
13461,4162,5," I am a supporter of the Saints"
13462,4163,5," I purchased this item has I had this make of car in my late teens early twenties. I was paying Â£4 11s 6d a year insurance and for general use put a Â£1 of petrol in the tank each week.I went all over the country in her and I cannot recall ever being let dowm by her."
13463,4163,5," Great Little item with fantastic detail.  Takes me back to my grandad when he had one of these cars.  It's used in my model village setup and looks really good.  The details is very accurate and I love it.  Highly recommended."
13464,4163,5," For Sweeney fans it's a must. Smaller than a matchbox but much more detail comes in it's own display box"
13465,4164,5," A typically great Minichamps model at a great price. An iconic car from a classic Bond film. Bought the submarine version as well and that's also a superb model."
13466,4165,5," Great toy& top quality& highly recommend! Also quite a good price. If you have two kids buy two toys to avoid fight :)."
13467,4165,5," The tractor was bought as a Christmas present for our grandson who is tractor mad. He absolutely loved it and seems tough enough to withstand a 7 year olds attention."
13468,4165,5," excellent sturdy quality. My son absolutely loves this tractor. Certainly better than what we imagined. It seemed q big even though it is the scale of 1:32"
13469,4166,5," Fantastic lorry bought for my husband who collects them these are as good as the corgi models very authentic highly recommended."
13470,4167,5," Nice little model well appreciated by my grandson!"
13471,4168,4," Expellant"
13472,4169,4," I expected a bit more& but it's an ok model for the price"
13473,4170,4," good"
13474,4171,5," Good quality and realism"
13475,4172,5," Looks excellent now it is completed. Bit of a fiddle building it."
13476,4173,5," My fiance is a scalextric fanatic and I got him these for christmas& the quality was amazing and they were in excellent condition. Thank you."
13477,4174,5," highly sought after model& supplied with no fuss. EXCELLENT!"
13478,4175,5," It's great!"
13479,4176,5," perfect thanks"
13480,4177,5," just what i wanted and excellent speedy delivery"
13481,4178,5," Good quality"
13482,4179,4," This model is a better quality - easy to put together. It arrived on time."
13483,4180,5," Brought as a joke present for my digger loving son who is in his twenties & he loved it ! A collector's item & not a toy . Arrived quickly and well packaged . Would definitely buy again !"
13484,4180,5," Very impressive detail and will be a great addition to my OO gauge railway layout. Very good price for such a quality product."
13485,4180,4," I bought this to help me sell another model it is a well detailed model considering small scale (1/87) why not 1/76 scale."
13486,4180,5," My tractor/digger/ excavator mad three year old great grandson absolutely adores this"
13487,4181,5," A fine model of this beautiful car from the 1950s& with a high level of detail from the chrome wing mirrors and windscreen wipers& door and boot handles and petrol filler cap which stands typically tall. The gap between bonnet and body is especially convincing& and the unusual rear door hinges are evident - the forward opening 'suicide' rear doors had the unusual feature of being pillar-less on the hinge side.The interior is detailed too with chrome rear view mirror standing on the dashboard& and of course there are seats and door panels in a rich tan colour.The model comes in a clear topped display case and the car measures 10mm or nearly 4 inches long."
13488,4181,5," I chose this for my husband who drove a similar one years ago& it was just what I wanted. Thanks"
13489,4182,5," Excellent quality. Very pleased with purchase."
13490,4182,5," Good service no problems"
13491,4182,5," very good"
13492,4183,1," This was bought for a three year old. Having decided against the Eddie Stobart because of reviews saying that the cab does not stay attached to the lorry& I trawled through all the other reviews to find one that did. Sadly& tow bar to the cab of this lorry is woefully inadequate and will only stay in place when stationary. Very disappointing and useless as a toy."
13493,4183,5," Brilliant brought one day came the very next day although it didn't really need the masses of boxing it had to.arrive massive box for small lorry"
13494,4183,1," Absolutely rubbish don't buy it. It fell apart in ten mins of having it. Cheap plastic crap !!"
13495,4183,5," Corgi = Quality at very respectable prices. Wide range available"
13496,4183,5," My little boy loves this !  Good value for money !"
13497,4183,1," product is great... Rubbish company advertising"
13498,4183,5," very happy well made good service thanks."
13499,4184,5," great model of the real thing. Siku have a good reputation for these type of toys. Would recommend these to anyone interested in farm machinerary"
13500,4185,4," I bought this for my grandson who is 5 years old at the request of his Mum. A tractor was the thing he most wanted for his birthday. I also bought the trailer which gives extra play value and makes it more fun. The only thing that happened was that the small pieces got pulled off very quickly. We were aware this might happen from reading other (helpful) reviews& but it does not affect the use of the tractor. Overall a good purchase."
13501,4185,2," Recieved faulty tractor& the pin that holds the front wheel fell out after two days and could not be found. Too expensive/much hassle to send item back for replacement so fixed it myself.Dissappointed overall as it seemed like a sturdy product initally& maybe it was just a one fault!!"
13502,4185,4," The tractor is large and impressive& with great detailing. It has not broken yet& but I am a little concerned that with rough play some of the plastic bits may start snapping off. I would have been much happier if this item had been made from metal. Overall though this is a great toy that will keep tractor fans amused for hours."
13503,4185,5," Amazed when this is all my 2 year old grand daughter wanted !! But she loves it ....loves it ..strong and so well made ..sturdy and whizes along with strong tyres and wheels . A good buy !"
13504,4185,4," A good little tractor. Bought at Christmas and has been played with quite a lot and is still intact now (including wing mirrors) in March!.. so fairly sturdy. The Cab lifts off so that you can place a small man inside (although doesn't come with any man). At first the cab was a little stiff and I had to lift it off for my son& but the unfortunate thing is that it now comes off quite easily- meaning that if he carries it around by the cab& the body of the tractor sometimes falls on the floor!Overall very pleased though! A good addition to our farm set."
13505,4185,3," I thought this would be the perfect christmas gift for a 3 year old& but the mirrors and the yellow flashing light were off within 2 hours of playing with it (nicely may I say& no throwing or smashing it about). but tractor itself is sturdy and made from metal. My boy still loves it."
13506,4185,5," The Britains range are enjoyed by 4 grandsons aged between 3 and 5 I can thoroughly recommend them for the younger lads  and lasses. Even dripped by adult of 6ft with no damage!"
13507,4185,5," Wonderful& solid item. Bought for my three year old nephew as a Christmas present. Has withstood his 'gentle' playing!He received quite a few John Deere products and they all look lovely and are good& solid toys. Very pleased!"
13508,4186,5," this bus was a hit and will probably take pride of place in colleagues flat. plus prompt service thank you."
13509,4186,3," Large? No& it is not large by any means but it is a red London bus with play value."
13510,4186,5," Brought for my 2 year old for Christmas& solid and he loves it."
13511,4186,5," Quick delivery and is lovely bus now grandsons favourite toy!"
13512,4187,5," excellent toy for the tractor and digger obsessed child& copes well with hard work in a sand pit or muddy puddle"
13513,4187,5," Fabulous - my 2 year old loves this and it wont break like most toys"
13514,4187,4," well constructed my 4 yo loves it"
13515,4187,5,""
13516,4187,5," very good"
13517,4188,5," Great sturdy product&replaced the plastic ones that originally had on farmyard& my six year old loves it A+"
13518,4188,3," Our 3yr old loves loves loves this toy. However I question its durability as:1. The roller blade kept comming off during gentle playing and got looser each time to the point I had to glue it on. Yes I could have returned but how long would our son be without his favourite toy?2. The low loader trailer comes in two bits"
13519,4188,5," Gave this to grandson aged 4& who is mad on farming and all the machinery involved. He loved it and it was by far his favourite present. Strong construction. Plays with it all the time."
13520,4189,5," A truly nice model of a Dust bin Wagon By Oxford Die Cast & will look good on any HO/OO railway Diarama or Scenic Set up"
13521,4190,5," great little mini model&&for less than a beer or burger&&the post cost more than the bike&&for this money who can complain"
13522,4191,5," PleaseEd with item"
13523,4192,5," Good piece for me as I work for the company"
13524,4193,5," I've wanted a model of this car for ages and when this one came along I just had to have it...Externally the paint job is blemish free and evenly coated. All decals are sited perfectly. Inside looks good too with a decent repro of the Firebird's interior. Engine and chassis detail is also excellent. If you want a good model of this iconic car& this is the one to buy!"
13525,4194,5," Excellent"
13526,4195,5," completely satisfied"
13527,4196,5," Brilliant Toy!"
13528,4196,4," lad loves it"
13529,4196,5," A+"
13530,4197,5," Detailed and well made model. Accurate to the original. Nicely present ed in ints box. There are other less detailed versions - this review only applies to this model."
13531,4198,5," It was for a gift& I knew it is slightly smaller than other available replicas but it looks great& the person who received it was happy and mentioned it was good detail that the wheels were turned up& the door opens and you can see the accelerator that Doc made."
13532,4199,5," I bought this to go in my collection of Corvette le mans models I am not disappointed with the build and paint work of the model"
13533,4200,5," Lovely corgi car thankyou"
13534,4201,5," Exactly as described& and delivered very quickly."
13535,4201,5," brilliant delivery and good quality product"
13536,4202,3," Well at Â£3.50 it was not a huge risk& but the actual car really is small (roughly 7cm long)& light and plasticky.  When something is described as |die cast|& and maybe this is just my age& but you have an expectation of a certain weight and solidity.  Had I been buying this in a shop I would have thought Â£1 tolerable.  The colour I received is orange& which is hardly a classic mini colour."
13537,4202,5," Cars were smaller than expected. Nevertheless they look sturdy and are good value for money. My son hasn't seen them yet as I bought them for his birthday. He loves minis and I'm sure he'll love playing with these cars."
13538,4202,4," Perfectly acceptable quality at a bargain price. this small Matchbox-sized car went down very well with the child I bought it for"
13539,4202,2," Disappointed with quality and colour. Described as red or blue& but presented as a khaki green. Paintwork shoddy."
13540,4202,4," You get only 1 car and not 2 as shown in the pic. But the cost is good even for 1 car."
13541,4202,5," Very prompt delivery. Product exactly as described."
13542,4202,3," color vary and have some mark on the item."
13543,4203,5," Excellent model really nice details& on it will look good on my model railway"
13544,4204,5," Very good"
13545,4205,5," Great gift idea for those who love motor bikes& comes in a clear dome to protect the model. It came very well packed too! so arrived without any damage"
13546,4206,5," Excellent service& would use again"
13547,4207,5," a1 thank you"
13548,4208,5," usual Tamiya quality"
13549,4209,5," Fast and furious well worth the servive"
13550,4210,5," Thankyou for a great diecast car it was very good value. My son loves it and doesn't stop playing with it thank you so much"
13551,4211,5," Product arrived within time stated& on opening the box it is classic Tamiya 1970's kit& good instructions and will make a good representation of the M23. You will have to buy the cigarette decals as the kit only has the basic decals which does push the price up& but it looks very plain without them& I manage to get some from Italy at a good price.On the whole a nice kit and not a bad price."
13552,4211,4," A welcome return to the Tamiya stable. Generally a solid model but still a bit dated in comparison to later (Lotus79) offerings. With after maket photoetch and decals it is poosible to produce a nice model."
13553,4211,4," Nice kit& as stated by other reviews & you'l need to buy the marlboro decals seperate if you want the authentic livery& can get them for under a tenner on ebay& also the car body is white& so will have to invest in the tamiya TS-36 spray paint& again can get this under a tenner on amazon. overall i'm happy with it."
13554,4211,5," Delivered a week late& but product was perfect."
13555,4211,5," great model great price and good service"
13556,4212,5," Very good but more should be in stockVery recommended and a superb price and very realistic from 2010 car"
13557,4212,5," bought this for my nephews birthday. he loves anything to do with formula one and spent hours carefully building this model - he loves it. value for money"
13558,4212,4," It looks okay but as it is for a present and hasn't been given yet I can't really say the outcome."
13559,4213,4," A good quality model in a presentation case.  Good for collectors as well as being a robust toy for a child."
13560,4214,5," Great thank you"
13561,4214,3," it come on time but you did not tell me it was in bits and you had to make it up can you not tell a person before some one bays it ? not that will be a good thing to do yes?"
13562,4215,5," As with all Oxford's models this is a great little replica"
13563,4215,5," Came quickly a good quality model at a good price."
13564,4216,5," Very good pleased & present for my grandson & bought previous ones in town so will save on postage in future and buy closer to home"
13565,4217,5," It is for Christmas& s we will have to wait and see.  I loved it howeve.  Shame it is a VW"
13566,4218,4," How long has it been since we had a Ghostbusters Ecto 1 car to display on our shelves& or pass on to our children? Of course& the Hotwheels 1:64 scale (matchbox size) released in 2010! But before that (unless you count the exclusively U.S. released Johnny Lightning models)& then it was way back in about 1986 You know& the Kenner |REAL GHOSTBUSTERS| effort that was a lot of fun& but not exactly accurate. Pretty much the only GB car available in those days however.Well finally something worthy of note is available. This is what we wanted back in 1984! An actual (attempted) replica of ECTO 1. Had it not been for Bill Murray forbidding his likness to be reproduced in toy form (so I'm reliably informed)& I can imagine we'd have had a whole host of film licensed goodies to enjoy. But alas& we were to be dissapointed"
13567,4218,4," like it"
13568,4219,5," Perfect!"
13569,4220,4," Lovely tractor!! Only slight thing is that the cab comes off- so can't pick up from the cab& but our 3yr old loves it!"
13570,4220,5," I bought this for my son for christmas and he loved it.  Very good quality and packed great.  Would recommend"
13571,4221,5," Good finish and superb packaging of this Maisto compared to the other maisto's that you get in India. Very good detailing."
13572,4222,5," sturdy vehicle ideal for a model railway"
13573,4223,5," Great product"
13574,4224,5," Purchased at a price to good to miss has gone up now but still a good buy.Oxford Diecast produce these models to perfection. A great addition to any collection."
13575,4224,5," Absolutely gorgeous detail& perfect addition to my collection."
13576,4225,4," Fantastic fire engine that is exactly as it says on the box. The battery pack with the lights and sounds is easily removed and is durable. Haven't tried putting water in it yet as the weather hasn't been up to outside play but it looks good and the hose is made in flexible strong plastic.Think we will have a few years of fun with this toy."
13577,4225,5," We bought this as a second birthday present for our son. Other Bruder toys have been passed down to him by his cousins (heavily used but still in great condition) so we knew in advance to expect a high quality brand. This fire truck absolutely hit the mark& he loves it and has played with it every day. We haven't used the water hose a lot (might have to wait till the summer!) but the other moveable parts (ladder etc.) seem to provide more than enough interest. Highly recommended!"
13578,4225,3," This fire-engine is quite large and looks good& however my 3 year old has managed to break off the door and it is not easy to fix at all (lots of small pieces). The water hose works well and can squirt quite far& but the plastic bit at the end of the hose does come off easily so can get lost as it is quite small (easy to put back on though). The ladder is not so easy to extend as you have to push quite hard on the plastic piece while pulling so is a struggle for and adult to do (there was no instructions on how to do this so had to scratch our heads for a while before we figured it out). The noises are good and not too loud and it does come with another set of light covers so those can also get lost if you make the mistake of showing your 3 year old how to change them. I got this toy thinking it would last& however was sadly mistaken as my boy broke the door after 6 months."
13579,4225,5," Bruder are the best for large scale models. Their designs are accurate and fun to play with& well made& and sturdy. I'd always recommend them."
13580,4225,4," Bruder makes the best trucks! this one is extra special as the doors open and the ladder extends to a great height. The hose can be rolled back on its spool the the water reservoir can be filled with water to make it work& shhhh! dont't tell the boy. I love also the many stickers it comes with to choose which country it is from."
13581,4226,5," OK As what was expected."
13582,4227,5," very good model at a very good price"
13583,4228,4," this model is very much a case of you pay what you get for. For a cheap diecast model this is exsactally what you would expect from motormax the manufacturers of this product. It has working stering and both of the doors open with reasonable but not great interior deatail. the detail on the lights is well done however the same sadley cant be saif for the wheels wich arent great. The paint finish a case of its exsctslly ehat you have paied for. There is nothing wrong with the finsh but being a cheap model its not what i would advise buying for a showcase or diorama model. So overall a desent model with one or teo things that really could be done a littell bit better."
13584,4229,5," Loved it"
13585,4230,3," I was disappointed with the red crane on the trailer& the lorry and flatbed are metal& the crane base is metal but the boom of the crane is bending plastic and it won't stay in place unless it is more or less upright or horizontal to the floor& such a shame.  The claw for the crane is metal so maybe too heavy for the plastic boom.  Thought it over priced due to this.  All other Siku toys have been brilliant and worth the money paid.  It does get played with but not as much as other ones my 3 year old has."
13586,4230,5," What a fantastic product attention to detail is second to none siku toys are the best may not be the cheapest but you get what you pay for"
13587,4230,2," I thought I was buying a sturdy 'more expensive feeling' toy& but it's just like the usual tat.  Very disappointing."
13588,4230,5," Superb toy& really well made."
13589,4230,5," Lovely item"
13590,4231,4," Bought this as a present& was everything that was described& friend loved it& worthwhile buy for moggy lovers as a gift"
13591,4232,4," Its not a detailed model but its not supppsed to be& its just a bit of fun& Its good for filling up a bit of space in a supercar fanatic's room& but if you want a sought after model& look elsewhere& Autoart are always a good make and I would recomend them to you& but here is my FXX statsStyle - 8Quality - 6Fun factor - 8.5Durability - 7.5"
13592,4233,4," good detail model as you come to expect from oxford diecast. i added a little weathering and is now happy on the farm on my model railway."
13593,4233,4," I was pleased with this product. It was rather smaller than I imagined but nonetheless it was good quality and a nice model."
13594,4233,5," Perfect size& great detail. Arrived in plenty of time and in great condition& dad loved it"
13595,4233,5," Looks very realistic with the cow shed."
13596,4234,5," Superb version of the best sounding Le Mans Car....ever!"
13597,4235,5," Really nice model.well detailed and fast"
13598,4236,3," A bit cheap looking and can see bits snapping of really easily may just have a duff oneI don't think I would recommend really"
13599,4236,5," Nicely made Siku Fodder Mixing wagon that has a red painted die-cast metal chassis and metal hopper as well as red plastic steps and green plastic side 'chutes'.There is also a plastic corkscrew type of device inside the hopper that allows 'fodder' to be mixed& though none is supplied."
13600,4237,5," Fantastic lorry bought for my husband who collects them these are as good as the corgi models very authentic great detail highly recommended."
13601,4237,5," good"
13602,4238,5," Item was as ordered and turned up 100% many thanks"
13603,4239,5," Very good models& thank you."
13604,4240,4," The Autoart version of the incredibly beautiful and curvy Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale is virtually irresistible.In fact I couldn't resist. As soon as I saw it& I had to buy it.The detailing is excellent and it could well become my favourite model car in my collection.However I do have some reservations. It is expensive and I keep asking myself& is it really worth the money? It's the only 1:18 version available but it's a big price hike up from the 1:24 model from White Box which I haven't seen. It's my guilty secret that I've spent so much on a model car."
13605,4241,5," Bought this Defender for my son - He has had a massive smile ever sinceVery good quality and very easy to assemble"
13606,4241,5," My son loved this as part of his birthday present. He is Landrover mad. Now sits proudly in his bedroom& easy to assemble."
13607,4241,5," Really good quality& my little boy loves it (and it is still in one piece!)"
13608,4241,4," It's good quality but very easy to put together so not much of a challenge"
13609,4241,3," Smaller than expected."
13610,4242,5," love it"
13611,4243,5," I love these oxford cars despite there size the detail is fantastic ! Will be constantly adding to my collection of 70s"
13612,4244,4," Arrived very fast and in excellent condition - not red as pictured& though that didn't matterOverall very happy with this product!"
13613,4245,5," I enjoy making this and i paint it tan and it really small. so i call it steel besty. sound great. so i bought my own paint and paint it on.I bought this on thur of july 25 and it came in on tues 30. really fast."
13614,4246,5," Lovely little model"
13615,4247,4," Great value car& only issue was that we were told if we purchased two they would send two different colours and that didn't happen"
13616,4248,4," Very happy and came on time"
13617,4249,5," Good finishing.Smooth . Nice model . Full diecast. Same model with twin axle in the rear of the Lorry section recommended."
13618,4250,5," Another great model from Oxford."
13619,4251,5," A good slot car out of the box - it is fast and stable even before any tuning.  Good purchase at a great price. My package came even quicker than expected."
13620,4252,4," Arrived in good time. Looks good and very well made.  My relative who was given it for his birthday now hopes for a larger version"
13621,4253,5," Very good"
13622,4254,5," A good buy. Thanks"
13623,4255,5," Nice little collector item"
13624,4255,3," NICE ONE."
13625,4255,5," v good"
13626,4256,3," I did not realise that it was a re-release of a 40 yr old kit! It â€Žhas very basic detail& as you would expect. A word of warning when you buy construction kits from â€Žwebsites& do a little background research first.â€Ž"
13627,4256,5," This product was for a friends brother who is in his 60's and decided to take up a new hobby. He seems pleased with it."
13628,4256,5," nice easy model to make was very pleased how it turned out"
13629,4256,5," Nice boat to build"
13630,4256,5," Excellent"
13631,4257,5," Extremely well designed model with parts that only require the slightest amount of sanding for the best fit.This model is by no means a simple model& it is a real challenge"
13632,4257,5," Superbly detailed model kit& experience needed in order to build."
13633,4258,5," Brought a number of these and was not disappointed& a lot cheaper than here in the UK just goes to show you buy for the UK packaging& just slightly smaller not that you would notice and received in a box so still suitable to wrap for Christmas... little girl going to love them.. thank you x"
13634,4259,5," Perfect. Arrived on time"
13635,4260,5," Great quality and quick delivery."
13636,4261,3," Good kit this& was as described but a few niggles.....rubber tyres...... strange molding shapes on the tyres made them look a bit oddrubber mud flaps.... not sure what type of paint can adhere to these and the transfers certainly do not stay bonded to them eitherpastic quality...... the plastic is a stiff and sometimes brittle& this makes it difficult to remove from the spruethis kit is not for beginners! there are over 200 parts and a fair ammount of shaping and smoothing of joints is required& the fit is not 100% so be careful and always try a dry fix before using glueit looks good when finished was very satisfied with end result"
13637,4261,5," excellent model"
13638,4262,5," Nice kit."
13639,4263,5," iam not going to wright a seperate comment for all these models but for informations to other buyers i would highly recomend the sellar  for best prices quick delivery .plus i will just say that nobody would be disapointed with these models and the sservice."
13640,4263,5," The trailer was purchased to match up with a truck my son has.  The fit is perfect& very pleased with product."
13641,4263,5," EXCELLENT ITEM& A++++++++"
13642,4263,5," great price great model"
13643,4264,5," My little boy loves this car. Good quality die cast and a good price many hours aying happily with it"
13644,4264,3," Smaller than expected"
13645,4264,5," Wel made  Minature"
13646,4264,5," Excellent"
13647,4265,5," The speed at which it came was very quick. The model is fantastic but two of the fittings on the pistons were missing (broken off) but i fixed it with some pins and the harness strap top on one side is missing to. This looks like a manufacturing fault."
13648,4265,5," I am very pleased with this item& although I decided not to fit all the tubes at the back& as they were so difficult to attach. I bought it to display on a shelf. It probably wouldn't last long if played with by a child."
13649,4265,5," Really nice item and the vender is very accomodating"
13650,4265,5," sick"
13651,4266,4," Older model V50 but still a good representation and just the right colour.  Almost the same fuel economy as my real motor as well!"
13652,4267,5," A paint job that looks like a case of Andy Warhol does Chuggington& and all the better for it. Maybe Virgin Rail could replicate the paint job on their West Coast main line franchise rolling stock? Just a thought Sir Richard.  Another well made die cast character& although the paint seems to chip more easily than on the range of Thomas products& also as it happens from a Mattel owned company. Still& lots of play value. Lots of good prices around on Chuggington& I suppose pending any decision to sped Â£4 million (Really?) on making a new series. Perhaps if that nice Mr Branson were to appear as a character it could oil the wheels to turn more quickly and bring it back that bit sooner for small viewers of the small screen?"
13653,4267,3," Brought for my grandson - to add to the collection we've got him for his birthday.  He enjoys them& so that's the main thing and they do seem quite sturdy and robust& which is just as well with a 3 year old!!!"
13654,4267,4," my Grand-nephew Loved this .. an now a a great collectionalso great as they don't have a big flat  So even thought he has a lot they don't take up much room"
13655,4267,5," again we loved this one& the kids have a grate time playing with it& its just pure magic and lots of fun."
13656,4267,5," One of my little boy's favourite chuggers due to the crane arm. Usual chuggington quality. Good price and fast delivery."
13657,4267,5," Yet another great addition to my sons ever growing collection. We will need another carry case soon to house them all."
13658,4267,4," Good value& excellent service in sale/delivery."
13659,4267,5," Very good fast delivery & item as decribed."
13660,4268,4," I read the reviews of similar bridges by other brands and was concerned at the quality& so we splashed out our 3 year old's birthday money on this one. We as well as him have been very pleased with it - him because he likes bridges and it is a lovely addition to his railway set and he likes winding it up and down& and we because the quality is good (the rising track is supported at the top so it can safely be leant upon by little hands).  I have only marked it down a star based on price& but ultimately the phrase |you get what you pay for| is probably true."
13661,4268,3," This is a nice addition to a Brio train collection. However& one issue with time with all Brio products that contain screws is that they become loose and everything becomes wobbly and won't fit properly. In itself it might not be unusual& but Brio's choice of triangle screw heads is certainly puzzling. As this kind of tool seems not too exist& it means that you have to wait for the screws to fall off to be able to replace them with a more useful design."
13662,4268,4," My daughter loves this Brio bridge. It's easy to use for a 4 yr old and looks good too. Quality you expect from Brio"
13663,4268,4," I bought this as a gift. What can I say. Brio. Always great quality and long lasting toys which children love and play with again and again. Recommend."
13664,4268,5," Amazing as always with Brio! My little man got this for his third birthday& and he absolutely loves it!! The detail and the fact it makes them interact by actually having to do things& rather than they press a button and it's all electronic is just fab!! He talks away for ages making his trains do all sorts& love it!"
13665,4268,5," You really can't go wrong with Brio& it is so well made and just lasts and lasts even with rough play. My son loves this bridge and finds the way it works fascinating. He is 6 years old and is still very fond of Brio! Makes a fun addition to any track."
13666,4268,4," Happy with this purchase. Delivery etc good. Perhaps a little tricky for tiny fingers as bridge opens by winding string round a spool."
13667,4268,5," I love these Brio train set additions almost as much as my kids.  Great quality.  And of course& flawlessly delivered by Amazon."
13668,4269,5," Great price for tracks... lasts ages.. not breakable as my 4 year old has played with them loads& stood on them& flew them etc and never bent out of shape"
13669,4269,4," Glad you can buy extra track for the take and play sets& but on carpet it falls apart quite often and my kids find it frustrating. Good sturdy stuff though and lots of combinations can be made"
13670,4269,4," I bought this to expand the Thomas Dino run. It does this except I cannot find a way to use all the pieces with the Dino run!"
13671,4269,5," Great addition to our take and play collection. As all take and play come with only a few tracks this extra pack of tracks it's a must in my opinion in order to connect the sets& make them bigger and more interesting. Price wise it was the cheapest I could find. Good choice of tracks and really value for money."
13672,4269,5," ideal for connect various thomas sets& the kids got thomas for xmax and was able to connect all together with this add on. Pleased with purchase and quick delivery"
13673,4269,5," Extra track is always needed& especially to link different Take'n'Play sets together.This pack of extra track has enough to get you started with building a network of track.I got it on offer which was good value& so 5 stars"
13674,4269,5," We bought this to extend the base take and play station& which we find so handy when going away so that our little boy still has a track for his trains. Nice quality as the original unit."
13675,4269,4," My two year old had been given three Take-N-Play sets for his birthday but they do not link up with each other by themselves& they need the extra track to act as spacers between the sets and also to cater for slightly different widths of the sets.  Very good purchase and a must-have to keep youngsters interested in the main playsets.  The parts are easy to link together and are sturdy enough to withstand a two year old's handling."
13676,4270,4," My daughter enjoys playing with this truck. Unfortunately it only gets four stars because I can remember the days when these toys were more detailed and durable and also to scale against other trains of the same set. It still brings joy to my child so who cares."
13677,4270,5," Very good service my Grandson will love it."
13678,4270,4," Excellent"
13679,4271,5," Arrived very quickly. Grandson very& very happy with Den. this adds to the other 80 odd he already has!!"
13680,4272,4," I have a 4 year old who loves building complex tracks and a 2 year old who loves playing with the resulting track.The 4 year old was getting bored as he couldn't direct the trains as existing junction track was random and this mechanical junction has added a little more complexity for him to make new& exciting track layouts.The mechanism was a bit stiff for the 2 year old but I suspect it will get easier as it is used."
13681,4272,2," I bought these switches at the same time as buying a battery powered Thomas train (Hiro). The train gets stuck going in either direction& and needs a bit of a nudge to carry on running.The whole point of mechanical switches is to not have to move the train by hand& so this is pretty poor in my book. I haven't tried this with other battery powered trains yet& so I can't say whether other trains will face the same problem.Update: I just bought these alternative brand items Toys For Play Mechanical Curved Switch Track (2 Pieces) and they are less than half the price and our battery powered train passes over them easily. Buy those instead!"
13682,4272,3," Pack contained 2 points& one worked fine and switched between the two train  track directions. However& the other was too loose and it was necessary to insert a small piece of matchstick to increase the stiffness& this kept the points in place when the remote controlled& electric train passed over them.Delivery was good and they arrived when expected& which gave me the time to check their operation and make the modification in time for handing them to the grandchild for Xmas.BRIO 33344 Mechanical Switches"
13683,4272,5," great way to change tracks and make the boys think about what they are doing with their trains.Fast delivery& easy problem free purchase& recommended seller"
13684,4272,5," These add a new dimension to the track and are well worth the money.  I love brio as do the children I mind and my own sons.We have great fun designing and making complicated tracks with bridges and imaginery streams and have many accessories including cranes so maybe we are just brio mad!"
13685,4272,5," It is a little expensive& but I consider it a must if you have battery trains. You can create the same railway systems you used to create but this time& the electric trains will change according to the switch position. The switch can be operated by children aged 3y+& once you teach them. This switches adds a new universe to the railway we have at home and the quality is top-notch& both the wooden parts and the plastic switch. Another hit from Brio. My kid is thrilled!"
13686,4272,4," As expected well made.  What isn't clear from the picture is the track can be turned over as the point mechanism is double sided.  Good for inventing new layouts.Only minor issue is the pins are not easy for small fingers to pull"
13687,4272,4," We use these with a remote control electric train& and they work brilliantly. However& my son is only 2 1/2& so he struggles to pull the switch mechanism across& as it's a bit stiff& and requires you to hold the body of the track to pull or push the switch."
13688,4273,1," These new |improved| engines are pretty poor. Yes& they are faster& but due to the changed drive wheels - the tread is more spaced out& formed of little spikes - the new engines can't pull many carriages. Worse& they can't go over the flexi track or the straight pieces of track designed to be used in stations. There just isn't enough friction between the new wheels and those types of track since the surface of the track is smoother. Gordon does work fine on the standard track& but my son always uses flexi track and stations in the tracks he builds.I have a very disappointed 4 year old (he'd been saving his stickers for a while to get Gordon) and would advise against buying any of these new engines. We won't be getting any more until/unless the design fault is rectified."
13689,4273,1," If the Government passed a law that specified a certain type of new tyre& and we all had to change our cars because of it& how would we feel? They seem to have done something similar with the Thomas Trackmaster engines! If you read any of the reviews for the various engines you will find people saying the newer engines with the ribbed tyres don't work on layouts using the existing track. Is there any new track that they do work with? Well& there is the new |Revolution| grey track with ribs but it's not very evident on the market.  The most common track seems to be the beige plastic one that everybody has. The problem is that the newer engines don't cross the points on a curve. They will just about struggle over points on a straight. The track needs to be free of bumps too. The new ribbed grey rails are found in |add-on| kits at present& and mostly involve steep ascents and fast drops.  They say they fit on to the older beige rails& but that means the new engines are expected to work on the beige rails& and& as so many people can tell you& they just don't (unless modified).I know people often like to |give and forget| when it comes to children's toys& but there is a problem when a toy doesn't work as expected& and in this case it gets quite technical. All of the engines have a raised part on the base& and this is to facilitate the use of things like |riser| rails that can be used to stop a train at the station by moving a lever (I've read about these& but have never seen any for sale). The newer type of engine has ribbed tyres on the wheels& and the wheels are smaller in diameter"
13690,4273,1," This is not a good product at all. It states that it is for Trackmaster tracks but it cannot be used on the old or the new tracks and as I was very organised with my Christmas shopping& I cannot return it now. Extremely disappointed."
13691,4273,5," This is for the NEW track master sets. Won't work well on old ones"
13692,4273,5," I bought this train to my son for Christmas& it is now part of his trains' collection and he is very pleased with it."
13693,4273,5," Brought for my nephew who loves track master trains he will love this and was very good value for money"
13694,4273,3," My son just enjoys pushing Gordon along& as we didn't realise it wasn' suitable for iur wooden track."
13695,4273,5," My son loved it& can't fault Thomas the tank toys from how happy they make my boy."
13696,4274,5," I bought this for my son when he was 2 and it is still nearly perfect after being played with for over 2 years. It has a few paint chips from being dropped but that's all. He has loads of Thomas the tank engine engines and I wanted to get him something he could play with with them without actually being from Thomas the tank engine. He still likes this as much as his other engines. He calls it Edward& as he doesn't have an Edward"
13697,4274,5," My Great grandson was delighted with his Big JigsTrain& as usual"
13698,4274,5," Wonderful little item"
13699,4275,5," This has become my 2 year old favourite train out of this collection. He even goes the bed with her. She is very sturdy not to heave but leaves a mark when thrown at someone (my child has a little temper issue). The paint work is fab and is showing no sign of wear even though she is played with through out every day. One of the best purchases this year"
13700,4275,5," my 4year old grandson was very pleased when he received more trains to add to his collection& Emily & Henry and Edward. He played with them all the weekend while staying with us. Was keen to introduce them to his other trains when he arrived home in France. They are very robust and good for imaginative play.."
13701,4275,4," arrived on time for Xmas from Japan (ahead of pessimistic forecast) and delighted my 30-month old grandson. Smiles all round."
13702,4275,5," Excellent item and delivered well within quoted lead time.  Extremely happy with service and I have a very happy little boy!"
13703,4275,5," Excellent quality. My little boy loves Thomas& especially Emily. He plays with this almost every day."
13704,4275,5," My son had been asking for this for a while and was very happy to receive it&plays with it non stop."
13705,4275,5," Beautifully made. Compatible with John Lewis wooden railway track. A quality made toy. Recommended!"
13706,4275,5," Little boy loved this train! Fast delivery. Train is certainly getting played with a lot!"
13707,4276,5," Bought this for my daughter who loves playing with her brother's Thomas trains. Lovely to have a girl train which is clearly hers - there aren't many girl track master trains for girls now which is a shame."
13708,4276,5," Excellent gift for our 2 year old daughter who just loves the other engines that her big brother has so will love to have this one for herself (christmas present).  Quick delivery as usual"
13709,4276,5," Great service.quick postage...Will def use again.....highly recc.......Grandson collects these trains.He has nearly all of them& but he still gets excited when one comes."
13710,4276,5," Great addition to my grandson's collection and he was very pleased that a tender and carriage was part of the purchase. Excellent condition and at a good price as always."
13711,4276,5," Bought for my Son& and has played with this non-stop. Costs a lot in batteries but that's another story. This Item is keeping him occupied which is amazing!"
13712,4276,5," My grandson loves it. He now has a collection of these. As the motorised version is not sold in Australia he feels very special."
13713,4277,5," My grandson loves all things trains so he was delighted with this gift.I continue to buy him anything wooden Chuggington that he doesn't already own."
13714,4277,5," My son loves the train . Sturdy"
13715,4278,5," needed more wagons to go with the mega crane.  this one works well& it is well made and my child loves it."
13716,4278,4," Very nice work done with this little peace. Kids playing around for over 6 months and it looks like new!"
13717,4278,4," good item"
13718,4279,4," One of my daughter favourite trains. Ive only given this a four star review because of the wheels. The wheels feel rather flimsy and after a short amount of play I have noticed a crack on one of the wheels. The wheels are still intact and work but it is a slight concern. The livery has all remained intact and the rest of the model is robust and weighty so the positives definitely out way the negatives"
13719,4279,5," Excellent service and very happy with purchase"
13720,4279,5," Great little train at a good price."
13721,4280,5," Made from Die-Cast Metal this little Percy Engine is the perfect addition to any of the Take-n-Play Thomas"
13722,4280,3," This die-cast metal Percy is sold as part of the |Thomas"
13723,4280,5," This is a nice little toy for any young child. It is well made and will survive a decent amount of chucking about. It's magnetic so which allows you to add the rest of the collection which my son loves. The Take -n-Play Percy is a lot of fun.My son already had the Thomas and two of the carts so Percy was a nice addition to the family.So if your children already have Thomas you are onto a winner."
13724,4280,5," My daughter has several Percys seeing as him and Thomas are usually released alongside other sets and packs. This is something to keep in mind if your also looking at buying some Take n play packs. The positive side is we have plenty of spare Percys.The product itself is sturdy and robust. Unlike other trains his livery is has withstood the tests of time and after extended amounts of play from my daughter the paintwork is still intact and unworn. This has been my main issue with some of the other trains in the Take n Play franchise so it does confuse me that some trains seem to wear more than others. Percy however as one of the classic favourites proves to be a reliable product capable of entertaining my daughter . Which lets face it& is the most important thing."
13725,4280,3," Percy is very small& just a couple of inches long. His core may be made from die-cast metal but there are so many bits of plastic attached (wheels& face& red base) that you wouldn't really know if it wasn't flagged up in the item description. It is a nice little toy but requires a track and some other engines to really play with. Unfortunately the wheelbase does not work on the standard wooden train sets because the wheels are just slightly too close together - this is a shame and a missed opportunity (presumably Mattel want you to buy their own tracks).It's not bad& but not that good either - just ok."
13726,4280,5," Having had some of these for our first born& it was a no brainer that our youngest would love them too!! They are sturdy& good quality toys that will amuse and engage children for hours.  They link together and you can buy other toys in the range to add to the fun& an excellent tool for imaginative play at any age.  The colours are vibrant and they withstand even the roughest of playtimes. Both our children are familiar with the story/cartoon and are always excited when they get given a new train to add to their already growing mix!!"
13727,4281,4," Various pieces cone apart that doesn't need to so bit fiddly for toddlers. My 3yo has played with it for hours at a time tho. Fights my brio track"
13728,4281,5," Perfect product"
13729,4282,5," Good quality and price"
13730,4283,4," There are hours and hours of fun in this set - for both young engineers and their parents. It is however a bit tricky to set up (for my 2 year old) and eager hands and feet can easily kick the tracks over& disrupting the fun.The mobile crane adds a lot of fun to existing Brio sets.Well worth the money - but wait until he or she is 3 years old."
13731,4283,4," Beautiful item& lovely attention to detail on the trains and the magnets and little accesories provide great fun for my little man. He's exceptionally happy there is road provided& as he can now combine his love of trains AND cars!!! The only downside is he is pretty heavy handy ( or enthusiastic if you want to put it that way!!) and I can't begin to count the amount of times he's broken the raised parts of the track& and can't yet put it all back together!! But yes I would highly recommend this product!"
13732,4283,5," A bit complicated for my 3yr old but once we've set it up he loves it& until he knocks the track off the rocks and we have to put it back together again."
13733,4283,5," Present for a godson aged three. He was thrilled and has had loads of use of it."
13734,4283,4," Bought this for my  2year old Grandson's Christmas and he loves it"
13735,4283,5," Brio is a lovely toy&little grandson thrilled"
13736,4283,5," Well made and robust and really good price."
13737,4284,5," Despite being quite a popular kids program Chuggington toys seems pretty hard to come by. This item was well made and exactly what I was looking for to expand my son's train collection."
13738,4284,5," Like all Chuggington die cast trains& the toy is solid and fun to play with&"
13739,4284,5," Not die cast but a great& very detailed chugger to add to a collection!"
13740,4284,5," Great model my son loves trains"
13741,4285,5," I have been planning a Christmas Tree train set for a couple of years and this year decided to plan early. Having a 2 year old I didn't want to take spend much as there is a fair chance he will get his hands on it.I took the plunge on this set and a well packaged parcel turned up a couple of days later. On first inspection the track is a nice slightly flexible plastic and a big 1.8m circumference circle. The loco is pretty weighty for a plastic train and after popping the batteries in it ran very nicely around the track.All in all this is a nice set and well worth the money."
13742,4285,4," My six year old received this as a gift. It's good value and although the track is not that sturdy (it's obviously not a wooden Thomas Tank track)& I was able to pick it up and move it without it falling apart so I think it's great. My son was able to assemble the track easily and loved it. He particularly likes the lights on the train.The track is a good size and reading the other reviews I like the idea of putting it around the xmas tree which is exactly what my son had suggested!A lovely gift for any little budding train enthusiast young or old!"
13743,4285,5," I was a bit worried about the quality when looking online but I was pleasantly surprised and how sturdy it is. The track fits together perfectly it's not wobbly and is flush to the floor& the train stays on the track& all the way round had a little light on and combine it with a village made of Lego and you've got hours of fun ahead. Fantastic toy."
13744,4285,5," I bought this for Christmas to go around the bottom of the tree as a |Polar Express|. The kids absolutely loved it."
13745,4285,5," I bought this set as a christmas decoration to put around the tree and I must say I was pleasently suprised when it arrived a week after I'd ordered it. The track is very good because it's sturdy& stays flat on the ground and is really stable so the train runs perfectly. The train itself looks quite reallistic and is quite sturdy on the whole. For 8 pounds what more could one ask for?"
13746,4285,4," a little fiddly and flimsy but then I expected that having read the reviews and it was exactly what I wanted as didn't want to spend a fortune."
13747,4285,5," Bought through  Amazon&box was damaged on edges poorly wrapped& but saying that bought for my grandson has a stocking filler and he love it he said it was his best present and played with it for hours"
13748,4285,5," This is a fantastic set& my 3 year old is in to trains and it makes a really great present if you don't want to spend Â£Â£Â£ on another model they might wreck. This is the one for you& it's reasonably priced and keeps the little ones entertained"
13749,4286,2," I would echo what dawn has already said. This engine will not move along at all on Ikea track. Moves ok in a straight line on other none branded wood track. I don't own any Biro or 'Thomas wooden railway' track so I cant speak for them.It also struggles around tight corners. However it goes well in straight line on the floor and because of that my son is very happy with it and battery operated Percy is his new 'best friend'."
13750,4286,5," This Percy engine is amazing! I bought it for my 2year old as his first engine on his new track. he loves it.  It is quite strong too& being able to pull up to about 6 or 7 trucks& carriages etc. round the track and over bridges.  It's the envy of his cousins& in fact they spent most of Christmas day squabbling over it!!  Will be buying the oldest one one of his own for his birthday.It has the feel of a good solid well built piece."
13751,4286,5," The brand does most of the work& but this well designed and solidly built replica is the business. Percy gets banged around alot by my 2 1/2 year old son& but is chugging on strong."
13752,4286,1," There is no wobble in the wheels& its totally ridgid& which means it doesnt go around corners& it dismounts the track and continues in a straight line. Also wheels are too wide for our other wooden track& the Thomas Track has slightly wider tracks than brio& ikea etc.So pretty useless."
13753,4286,5," I bought this for my youngest grandson for Christmas. They have a wooden track table layout and he enjoys using it with the battery powered engines. The ones without tenders take the corners better. He loved it. A pity there aren't more of the battery powered ones in the Thomas characters. A sturdy toy. Quick delivery."
13754,4286,4," This arrived quickly in good condition. It doesn't have the sophistication of an earlier Thomas that was gifted to our grandchildren i.e. shunting capacity& but on the other hand it doesn't have the irritating chuff-chuff& toot-toot either& which the kids seem immune to. So on the whole& a good by then!"
13755,4286,4," Good quality product although pricey for what it is."
13756,4286,5," My grandson loves anything to do with Thomas trains so this is brilliant for him. Only downside is it eats batteries! Going through one every day at the moment! Other than that it's great - well recommended"
13757,4287,5," This takes my three years old grandson's toy engine collection to near 100. The Rocket is his favourite and he now has it in various forms. This one is well made &colourful and safe . Probably a little young for a three years old."
13758,4287,5," My 5 year old got this as a present and he absolutely loves it.  He recognised it as the Rocket immediately and that it resembles Stephen from the Thomas series - one very happy steam train fan. A great addition to any train set."
13759,4287,5," My son loves Stevenson's rocket. Like any other trains made by biigjigs this piece is solid and made well. It's quite accurate and my son recognised it as soon as he saw it. Highly recommend!"
13760,4287,5," Lovely toy of an often ignored engine."
13761,4288,5," Never seen this before - BRILLIANT gift - Brilliant adaption to our ever growing train set for my 2.5 yo son!  My 5yo daughter loves it all too!"
13762,4288,5," Colourful and strong and my grandson loved it. Reasonably priced and just the right size for small hands to enjoy"
13763,4288,4," Very good. Adds an interesting element"
13764,4288,5," As described and delivered quickly."
13765,4289,5," What a great little set. My son and I have been collecting the odd piece of Brio railway& but this has been our biggest purchase. He loves playing with it and spends all day arranging tracks& offloading cargo etc. Brio is such a durable and clever system. For this reason he will have this set to pass onto his own kids. This set encorporates so many elements and we love the battery engine too."
13766,4289,5," Excellent quality. The equipment is quite ingeneous"
13767,4289,5," Great Brio set - purchased for my three year old little boy.  Fantastic value for money and compliments the rest of the Brio set we have perfectly."
13768,4289,5," My two year old son loves it he won't leave it alone. Yes it's expensive but it's worth every penny it will last him a long time unlike some other cheaper toys out their at similar prices. I don't normally review products I've purchased from amazon but I feel this deserves it."
13769,4289,5," My son love playing with it. Good quality&easy to install&not as easy to put it back in the box but this is not an issue."
13770,4289,5," I got this for my Niece's little boy and he has played with this all over Christmas. It's very well made as you would expect from Brio. I can also add to this for birthday's etc."
13771,4289,5," My son loves this! It's very good quality and I'm sure he will play with it for many years. The electric train in particular is great!"
13772,4290,5," Lovely addition to add to other Brio trains& my little boy was over the moon with this. The tanker itself is magnetised so can be used with the crane etc."
13773,4290,4," Good buy and good toy. Nothing new for Brio. It is as Kids Toys shoud be! Nice looking and qualitative!"
13774,4290,4," good item"
13775,4290,5," Very good"
13776,4291,4," Very plasticky& and there is little involvement if any that I have come across of the character in the stories to encourage a long play life. Still a worthwhile purchase as there are so few recent additions to the range."
13777,4291,1," Sadly it's came and one of the pins missing so the top keeps coming out ."
13778,4291,5," Great addition to grandsons collection he loves Huntington.."
13779,4292,5," BRILLIANT VALUE.  GREAT FUN AND COMES WITH TWO SHORT BITS OF TRACK INCLUDED& MAKING VALUE EVEN BETTER."
13780,4292,5," It will no doubt a big hit with my grandson& as it is a Christmas gift from his nanny."
13781,4292,5," Well made& well packaged& arrived promptly = happy grandson ."
13782,4292,5," Hours of fun.."
13783,4292,5," Fine"
13784,4293,5," My 2 year old loves this Thomas train and carries it around with him wherever he goes.  It's light comes on when the wheels turn and it also makes a train sound and the |choo choo| noise.  There is also a button you can press to turn the lights and sounds on."
13785,4293,4," My 22 month old is obsessed with Thomas& and particularly these Take-n-play toys - perfect size for little hands. Prices online vary A LOT and felt this item was good value and free postage is a bonus. My little boy loves it and takes it everywhere."
13786,4293,5," excellent 15 month old loves it& and could operate it& very quickly& the three year old also wanted to play with it"
13787,4294,5," My son is a collector of the little mini trains and this Classic is a great addition."
13788,4295,5," My son follows Thomas the Tank& he is 20 months old and when he grows up he wants to be a train I am sure. I have 6 or 7 of these now. They are age ranged from 36 months but my son competently plays with these and the worst thing that has ever happened is we lost one when we went shopping! He failed to mention it at the time. Stepney is one of the older engines from about 20 years ago I think& I don't think he looks all that good& he is an odd colour and he has a big nose& but because we have old dvds and new ones he is a regular in our house. I will confess he has been in the bath several times and as a result there is paint chipped and missing but what else can you do when your son thinks Sodor is around every corner. I don't think these will be any good to anyone when he has done with them but as long as he enjoys them right now I am happy for him to cover him in bubbles and shout oh noo! in his dramatic little voice.These are ace!"
13789,4295,5," This was delivered so quickly& I was well impressed!. The item itself was a really perfect little train which is much loved by its owner."
13790,4295,4," I have started to collect these Thomas items for my grandson but have to admit they are quite small and slightly disappointing."
13791,4295,5," Bought for my grandson who loves his |Thomas's|.  I'm sure this will be very well received.  Arrived promptly."
13792,4295,5," I was supposed at how small it was but you'll already know that if you've brought the range before."
13793,4295,5," lovely engine my grandsons are delighted good packing and prompt delivery many thankscheers"
13794,4295,5," Son loves him& can as an add on so was a lot cheaper than retail proce which is fab."
13795,4295,5," brought for sons birthday& good quality fast delivery& am very happy with item."
13796,4296,5," Excellent detail very pleased"
13797,4297,5," Another great model by ERTL. One of the most iconic vehicles from the early Thomas seasons. Tom Tipper's post van delivers post and parcels to people all over the Island of Sodor.Model very well detailed with a particularly good paint finish. Looks good alongside ANY other Thomas toy range. Highly recommended."
13798,4297,4," this is from old set but still compatable with new thoams son loves it postman pat for thomas good design but wheels chunky for model but good value for moneyfast service"
13799,4297,5," My grandson will enjoy this"
13800,4298,4," We bought this for our four-year old son. He has a lot of Brio& and loves trains.It's very simple& but he gets a lot of fun out of it. Some of his Brio wagons have magnets on top& which allow them to be picked up by this crane. He soon discovered that he could also pick up engines by the coupling magnets& allowing him to perform rescues of trains that had gone off the tracks.It's very simple& there's very little to break& and it seems to be solidly made. A very good toy& that my son gets a lot of enjoyment out of."
13801,4298,5," My son loves these and they are well built. Recommend to everyone to buy from big jigs. Very happy customer"
13802,4298,5," Just what my Grandson wanted - Thank you"
13803,4299,4," Just bought this and it's a simple but effective design consisting of a wooden base and plastic turn table that sits inside the base. A little knob turns the table. However& it turns too easily so when a train moves over the table it can just kick it our of line& causing problems for the following train. It's not a deal breaker& just mildly irritating. Overall pleased with purchase."
13804,4299,4," My soon to be 4 year old son asked for a turntable for Christmas and is still delighted with this. It's simple in design (cog) and very sturdy. The red plastic wheel just sits on top of the base"
13805,4299,4," I got this to expand what we could do with our existing brio& my boy always seems to enjoy train track more when playing with someone else's set& so I thought maybe he couldn't do enough with the set he has. Turns out that is just the way children are - he can play with his cousin's train set for hours but get it out at home and within minutes he's doing something else. Anyway& the thing I would say is be aware the red plastic only sits on the wood thanks to gravity& so the two are likely to part company in the toy box. No damage done& you only have to sit it back on top and away you go."
13806,4299,3," Item arrived earlier than expected which was pleasant surprise. excellent delivery information once again& well done amazon.  This item was smaller than expected so was a little disappointed and the turn knob is  difficult to operate& have yet to see how three year old manages it&"
13807,4299,5," very useful piece of the train track. Outstanding quality Brio. Easy to use once my little grandson worked out he needed to turn the knob...but he has only just turned 3. :)"
13808,4299,1," One of the connections was not cut correctly so the track would not connect on one side. Sending back for replacement& luckily Amazon have a very easy returns policy but not what I would expect. Unusually other brands have better turntables as the central table is connected to the base unlike the brio one. Cogs are meant to align the track but because it is loose they don't line up cleanly which makes getting it straight is awkward for a child.The turntable will not work with the longer trains like brios |big red|."
13809,4299,2," I was surprised how smallish and flimsy it is. The knob turns very very easy but that is a problem because my son just cann't make it straight for battery powerd trains to pass as red plastic part rattles and mooves when trains are passing. The red part actualy is not attached so it always get lost in tracks' box and I am afraid one day it will get smashed under other wooden parts. If sending back would not cost me half of the price I paid for it& it would be back in the shop."
13810,4299,5," grandson loved this toy to make up the rest of this purchase of his rail track it was well packed and posted on time"
13811,4300,5," All the thomas the tank trains i have purchased have been excellant value for money.My grandson adores them and has currently got 54 trains and endless buildings etc.Cannot fault them in any way."
13812,4300,5," A large mainline express engine and one of the original characters from the Thomas the tank engine stories and so a must for every collection& along with Gordon& James& Edward& Percy& Duck& Toby& Donald and Douglas as well as Thomas of course!"
13813,4300,5," Much awaited present and very well received. Big smile and |can we open it please|! Track and trains out every day and now Henry can join in too."
13814,4300,5," Another take and play engine from Thomas and friends. Kids love them - they all add on to make longer trains. Good solid toys that will last."
13815,4300,5," This is a nice toy for my son who is age 3"
13816,4300,5," this is amazing product& my son loves it. very good quality. I would recommend it to a friend. I would buy it again."
13817,4300,5," Grandson loves it.  These trains are great for imaginative little minds and they help teach colours and numbers - our grandson knows all the |numbered| trains even Hiro (number fifty one) and also the colour of each engine along with their name."
13818,4300,5," Have a big Thomas fans and he loves all these trains that go with his Take n Play sets.Just be warned that if you start getting all the characters the amount you spend will run in to the hundreds."
13819,4301,4," I purchased this train set for my 4 year old sons birthday. He had a small set that came from tescos and we have a few bigjigs and brio pieces already - but we were after something with a bit more to do& think about rather than just running a train along a track with trees around it.This set on quick inspection did impress me. What initially attracted me to it was that 1. It's in a container and therefore can be stored 2. There are trains as well as construction vehicles and 3 it's a construction site with a crane and is very different in that most train sets like these are travel oriented and do not explore many other uses of trains.I expected the box and the lid hill to be really flimsy - but it's surprised me and is actually very robust. The track is all compatible with all of the other major brands - worked with our tescos track& bigjigs& brio and thomas trains. The track is all good quality. No issues there. It is worth noting however that the track that is ascending / defending and single track that splits in two directions is the ball connection at the top rather than the wood circle slot. This ball seems robust and connects and disconnects well but the ball end is known with wooden sets to come off. These seem pretty strong& but it's worth mentioning.There is a wide variety of accessories but one thing I do not like about the tracks is once it's all set up my son is not fussed about the trees or signs and they stay in the box and it seems a terrible waste - this isn't the first and no doubt will not be the last to say a sets got an impressive number piece set an the majority is trees and signs. The accessories aren't bad - but they are plastic.Read more â€º"
13820,4301,3," Expensive considering the quality of the track.  Its a nice layout however after only a few weeks of play some of the ball joints that connect the tracks together have come lose and constanty fall out. Not ideal and a cocern for younger childern who may play with the train set."
13821,4301,5," love it for taking out and on holiday nice and compact"
13822,4302,5," Well pleased"
13823,4303,5," I think this is 5 star because the quality of Brio toys is so great !!They all fit onto other carriages and cars."
13824,4303,5," Smaller than expected but good quality. I bought this as a Christmas present so I haven't sent it to Santa yet.Would definitely recommend"
13825,4303,5," The set is just what I expected and will enhance the set I have bought for my grandsons for Christmas!"
13826,4303,5," My grandson aged 22 months loves his brio rail track so this was to add interest to his playing as was the train garage"
13827,4303,4," Bought as xmas present with several other items.  Nice colour bright and grandson loved that there was a animal with it.."
13828,4304,5," Excellent quality"
13829,4305,5," Have purchased to add to an extensive collection of Thomas toys. Even though it has not been played with yet as it is for a Christmas stocking filler& I have tried it out. I was suprised that the story books pop up like in the story it features in& and that it is not just a solid truck. My little boy will love it I'm sure."
13830,4305,4," lovely little add on to any thomas collection. the trailer has a little button that makes the books pop out& my son loves pretending thomas has lost his load like often happenens in the program."
13831,4305,4," Purchased two.. who often have to be hauled by train to the pretend school where they pop up to be unloaded there for the children ( pretend ) Great !"
13832,4305,5," Brilliant toy& my son loves playing with it. He enjoys how the books pop up and that he can connect the cart to his other take and play toys"
13833,4306,4," My son loves it! He is always on it and now wants more trains& do you have anymore trains that you will be selling???"
13834,4306,5," This railway carriage compliments my ho gauge Taff Vale Tank perfectly"
13835,4306,4," adding another carriage to my son Thomas collection"
13836,4307,5," Large compared to most of the other Thomas take and play characters& quite a bit of plastic but still feels pretty durable. Makes only a brief couple of appearances in the latest Thomas movie Tales of The Brave& but potentially offers lots of play value being a bit different."
13837,4307,5," Cant wait for my little boy to open this on his birthday the take n play range are really good quality"
13838,4307,5," Excellent toy. Arrived in pristine condition all promises kept. As for grandson he was over the moon."
13839,4307,5," Bowed to pressure from my grandson who really really wanted this scrap monster and he loves it"
13840,4307,5," Bought as a Christmas gift. Small like I thought but most take n play engines are!"
13841,4307,4," Received order quickly. But toy received was different to one shown in picture."
13842,4307,5," Grandson loves this figure which was in a movie i bought for him."
13843,4307,5," I am sure it will be a hit& bought for Xmas present"
13844,4308,5," Looks amazing& really pleased and a good price to my son is going to love his birthday present"
13845,4308,5," Great product fits perfect with my son's brio track."
13846,4308,5," Really good value and durability"
13847,4308,4," good"
13848,4309,5," This is another great little train for using with the Take'n'Play train sets& we've been collecting these gradually as and when they've been on offer.They are good quality die-cast metal so can handle some pretty rough play at the hands of energetic& enthusiastic and destructive little people.When these trains are on offer& they are good value so 5 stars."
13849,4309,5," Son loves him great addition to any thomas fans collection& got him at a bargain price which is awesome as I feel these trains are totally over priced."
13850,4309,5," Enjoys very much being at the tail of long heavy goods trains. Reliable breaking ability& works well with troublesome trucks."
13851,4309,5," Arrived on time& well packaged and a decent price. The toy is a present for Christmas and our grandson will love it."
13852,4309,1," Received a different item than the one asked for"
13853,4309,5," arrived on time& good value on lightning deals."
13854,4309,5," My 2 year old grand son really liked this."
13855,4309,5," great to add to your oollection"
13856,4310,4," The lad aged 19 months absolutely loves it& as does 64 yo grandad. It works as a clockwork train as well as remote control& which is a bonus as the wee one can switch it on and off and put it into reverse himself when he cant get the remote off his Papa. Personally I wish they made a more retro version& and one slight quibble is that the passenger carriage doesn't go through the tunnels when the passenger is on board as her arms stick out the side of the carriage (unsure if tunnel is Brio). The sound effects and headlights are good.Original (duracell plus) battery still working after 7 hours use& though will need changed soon as the engine is starting to struggle up the slopes with carriages attached."
13857,4310,2," I can compare this train to Electric Train with Remote Control as I own both. In overall the Brio's piece is very poor performer on a hilly/elevated rail and can only be recommended on a completely flat track. Besides of that it derails far more often and is less track-fault tolerant but that can solved with careful track design.In detail compared to Electric Train with Remote Control Brio's piece shows the following deficiencies:- it often gets stuck in climbing a hill even on the original BRIO 33332 Ascending Tracks- almost never overcomes Arch Bridges (like ...Read more â€º"
13858,4310,5," This train is awesome! It's easy for a 3 year old to control and really fun for all ages. The control goes forward& backwards& faster& switches the lights on and off and makes a choo choo noise. You have to make sure the little red semi circle on the control is pointing at the train for it to work well though. It goes up and down hills with ease and other carriages from other trains can be attached. Looks really good with its little lights on in the dark! My daughter puts all her other little toys in the carriage it comes with to give them rides. Daddy has loads of fun with it too! We used good quality batteries and still going strong. Glad we chose this one out of all we looked at."
13859,4310,4," This toy was bought for my Grandson's 4th birthday.  He was thrilled with it and played with it all afternoon.  However& in spite of using Duracel ultra batteries after about two hours the train was visible slower."
13860,4310,5," Good value for money. Looks more expensive than it actually is. It is a little powerhouse& pulling many carriages with ease!"
13861,4310,4," Such a nice product but slightly temperamental. The remote only works with fresh batteries replaced regularly and with it being pointed very near the train. A bit tricky for a 3 year old. But I believe it is the best brio remote battery powered one they offer."
13862,4310,1," This train is very speedy and whizzes around the track. It was given to my daughter on the 5th September as her birthday present and two months later the motor has burnt out. Expensive for a toy that didn't last - I expected more from Brio!"
13863,4310,5," We've had lots of fun with this. The controller is intuitive and responsive& and the train goes much faster than the standard battery brio engines& so is great for making the most out of large track collections."
13864,4311,5," My 2yr old grandson was given Annie as part of the Take Along Thomas collection. He loves watching the programmes and these little engines& trucks and carriages are just right for his little hands. He gets great enjoyment from playing with them and so far they are still as good as new. The engines are metal and appear to be robust and although plastic& the wheels are still whole. I think they are a good buy."
13865,4311,5," My Grandson absolutely adores these little trains and we had tried all over the place to get Annie and Clarabelle with no luck at all& but of course Amazon came up trumps and he was delighted with them.These toys are well made& great quality and arrived neatly packaged and in great time."
13866,4311,5," Annie is one of Thomas's coaches and is highly valued by Take-Along-Thomas enthusiasts! The engines and coaches in the series are neat and robust."
13867,4312,5," This is another great little train for using with the Take'n'Play train sets& we've been collecting these gradually as and when they've been on offer.They are good quality die-cast metal so can handle some pretty rough play at the hands of energetic& enthusiastic and destructive little people.When these trains are on offer& they are good value so 5 stars."
13868,4312,5," Very please with htis item.  Will see if my grandson is too at Christmas."
13869,4312,5," Strong sturdy and with standing through rough and consistent play. His livery and paintwork have withstood the test of time and remain unscuffed and no wear what so ever which is good when compared to other Take n Play Trains. A cool peculiar looking train and definitely recommended."
13870,4312,4," Grandson loved it. Kept it with him when he went to bed."
13871,4312,5," Great for any Thomas fan that already has all the other trains. As usual good sturdy quality"
13872,4312,4," This is really well made"
13873,4312,5," Great addition to any take and play items& loved by my 3 year old&  well made item"
13874,4312,5," Great little engine. Son very pleased with his latest addition. Fast delivery. Xx"
13875,4313,5," Christmas present for our son.Tried to build parts as per photo - no such luck....Not sure whether down to my incompetence or lack of parts. Suggest it is my incompetence !!Overall& lots of parts (push along engines& carriages& trees& people& etc)& well made and the only hold back is my imagination !Generally robust and well made.Slightly disappointed that there was no leaflet/instructions within the two cardboard boxes. Some 'design' ideas would have been nice& although I suppose the design is left to the children& who may not be able to read anyway !!I would recommend."
13876,4313,5," Great value way to get into wooden trails - compatible with thomas& brio& tesco and others this set is a great value starter pack"
13877,4313,5," My eldest son plays with a similar set at Nursery School and raves about it& so we bought it for Christmas for him and his younger brother. We've found it to be a great toy& strong& well built and lots of fun to set up and play with. It's a train set& what little boy wouldn't love it?"
13878,4313,5," Great product"
13879,4314,2," Really disappointed with this. Some of the track was splintered and hadn't been sanded off properly so was very rough. The paint on the buildings was poor and chipped. The buildings are in pieces and velcro together - but the glue sticing sticking the velcro to the buildings has overspilt.Amazon sent a replacement but this was just as bad - for Â£50 I'd expect something better quality."
13880,4314,5," Good extension to the train track"
13881,4314,5," love it!"
13882,4315,5," These junctions let my grandsons link their road layouts together - I bought 4& but you do need at least two for this prupose. The short grey sloping bits allow vehicles to run off into a |car park| or onto a different road system."
13883,4316,3," This toy is part of a set my nephew is collecting and although its not the most exciting one he does enjoy playing with it with the rest of the set. I do think it is over priced for what it is& as it is quite small and the quality of the painting wasn't great. Its ok though and does the job."
13884,4316,5," Delighted"
13885,4317,5," My three children absolutely love this train table by Kidkraft. We generally lean towards their products due to durability and overall high standards. This table keeps my crew entertained throughout the day and is good to have indoors when the weather is not so great. We've owned the table for two weeks and though happy with the product& I am not impressed with the trains or the additional pieces. For one& the trains have all come apart (base and all) while my kids were in the midst of playing. The only pieces that stayed intact were the firetruck& police car& helicopter& and airplane. The additional pieces are cheaply made. The crane is not sturdy and topples off the table often. Just today& the firehouse came apart.Luckily& over the years I have been investing in the Thomas the Tank Engine Trains& which have been a lifesaver. As an added bonus& the Thomas tracks are compatible with the ones that came with the Mountain Train Table.I think overall& you can 't beat the price& which is quite reasonable for the size and quality of this table. Definitely look into investing in higher quality trains if you want to make your train table worthwhile."
13886,4317,5," Wow& this is sooo cool! I got it for a great price (on special offer) and it was well worth the money! Its sturdy once you've put it together (my nephew walks on it to get to the other side and he's 2!)& there are 3 plastic drawers that slide underneath to fit all the bits in& the train track is well made with a bridge and 'tunnel' and the vehicles are simple but effective. It comes with a train with 3 carriages held together magnetically (each carriage has a coloured 'cargo' that fits on top)& a 'plane (which has a short runway)& a helicopter (with a wooden landing tower)& a crane (with windey string and hook for 'cargo')& a police car& fire engine& and ambulance (all made of wood with wheels which also go on the train track). It also comes with a little wooden boat& and 6 wooden cut people which include a policeman and a mechanic! There are 2 little 'Gas' station fronts (Pfft - I'm English :) ) which come in wooden bits so you can build them up easily (which also means they come apart easily)& some wooden trees and bushes& as well as road signs& bollards& traffic lights and barriers which are plastic. The table itself has grass and water and shrubs printed on it.  It was hard work to build up the train track& and it doesn't fit exactly to the road (printed on the table)& but it's not fixed down anyway so it moves around. This allows for changing of the track so its not a negative thing. All in all its a fantastic toy and should last years as other things/imagination come into play& and it can be as tidy as you want as all the above fit into the trays underneath. Its quite large tho& and you need room around it to get to it all. Brilliant toy."
13887,4317,4," this product was very good but there was a piece of track that goes over the bridge missing it took a while to set up but despite missing piece my son really loved playing with it"
13888,4317,4," great item great build quality found the table to be sturdy and after 1 year it looks good and the trays are not even bust good toy"
13889,4317,5," Absolutely fantastic& any child who comes into our home plays with it. Hours of imaginative fun. Brilliant price (bought for Â£84) bargain. Sturdy also. Easy to set up.m"
13890,4317,5," Excellent product. Easy to assemble& great quality and comes with loads of great pieces. Bought for my 2 year old for his birthday and he loves it. Storage trays underneath are a great bonus and somewhere to put other items. We can see the train table will also be good for other sets in the future."
13891,4317,5," This item is just the BEST! NOT ONLY DID MY 2 year old GRANDSON love it but his older sisters and cousins had a wonderful Christmas Day playing with it.Very well made and wonderful for imaginative play."
13892,4317,4," Great size& son loved it but the build quality isn't to the highest standards but definitely worth the money in my opinion and keeps both my children entertained."
13893,4318,5," I purchased these for my son to go along with the Thomas he got with one of the take-and-play range tracks and he loves them. Being aged 2 they have been dropped& thrown& dunked in water and used for flying practice off the dining room table& always surviving without a dent or scratch even after 6 months.The carriages are good quality and well painted with great detailing& and are a must for anyone looking to get the take-and-play range. However I wouldn't purchase for a younger child as they are metal and quite heavy& there are other Thomas"
13894,4318,1," Although these toys are for children& the products recieved should be as described and pictured.The latest version did not meet this criteria. The faces are not as attractive& there are no black lining detailon the side of the carriages& no red colour on the ends and no window glazing.The overall impression is of a cheaper and inferior version.Not that my grand daughter will notice& but that is not the point."
13895,4318,5," Annie and Clarabel help create hours of fun to the Thomas take-n-play collection.  My son is four and he loves pulling Thomas along with Annie and Clarabel connected behind.Very pleased."
13896,4318,5," Just another couple to add to my grandson's collection . I keep thinking that surely the collection must be complete .How wrong am I & there is always someone else on the 'List' !"
13897,4318,4," my grandson is a thomas tank engine fan some of the tpys he asks for are hard to fined but i have always managed to get them on amazon and make a wee boy very happy"
13898,4318,5," Thank you& it arrived at the birthday house and the birthday boy was delighted. it went well with the other pieces previously ordered. great."
13899,4318,5," What can you say& it is the inseparable Annie and Clarabel& stalwarts who have passed the test of time and a must for any Thomas set. Well made and durable& the set I purchase have lots of detailing& although I have noticed recently from other feedback that later packs may be offering a different version? Also& the price seems to be going up and the availability coming down as tends to happen when a product line is being discontinued. Surely that can not be possible in this case?"
13900,4318,5," If you have the take n play Thomas& you have to get the Annie and Clarabel carriages to go with him don't you? Fans of the 1980's version of the show will remember them well& though sadly& they don't seem to play much of a starring role in the new animated one. The carriages& like the engines from the take n play range& are die cast metal with magnets front and back to allow them to be coupled up to Thomas or indeed any other engine from the excellent take n play range."
13901,4319,4," Good quality."
13902,4320,5," Fantastic - my 3 year old grandson loves Bigjigs and other wooden trains. So do I!  This set is great. But one point could do with a mention. My husband and I - both of us have a few brain cells - could not figure out how to end up with pieces of track with the correct orientation at each end. Then the penny dropped - the big piece of track that fits inside the station can only go one way round!! Even though it will fit either way round& if it's not facing the correct way& the track won't slot in. It would have been very useful& and saved a lot of swearing and moaning (from my husband& not from me!!)&  if the instructions had stated this."
13903,4320,5," This is a great train set. My 2 year old daughter loves it. It comes with 4 people and some (unnecessary) trees but she enjoys the fact teat the train goes through the station& underneath and up high. It all folds away neatly too& although I struggle to get all the pieces inside the station at the same time! I'll need to work on that! The roof is reversible with a roof that has snow on it and the sides of the station slide off& one section is reversible with a pond on the other side. Overall& it is very good quality."
13904,4320,5," Sturdy station that doubles up to provide storage &high and low level crossover. Satisfying toy with capability to be expanded."
13905,4320,5," I can't wait to play with this at Christmas! With my Grandson of course...."
13906,4320,5," Brilliant product as always from bigwigs."
13907,4321,5," good quality"
13908,4322,5," A durable die cast toy to add to any child's Thomas the Tank Engine collection. My little boy loves it."
13909,4322,5," Really quick delivery time from placing order. As with all Thomas Take n Play diecast engines and vehicles and also the track sets& I will look around for the best price as although they are sturdy pieces& they are quite expensive. Best price that I found for Diesel 10!! Little one loves it!! After reading reviews of the product (regardless of seller) did think that Pinchy (Diesel 10's claw) didn't move& granted it doesn't |pinch| or clamp down& but was pleased to see it does actually move!!"
13910,4322,4," My 3 year old was absolutely thrilled after seeing his beloved diesel 10! LOL! He's been ever so busy playing with it! He loves it!But like the other reviewers have said...What's with the claw??? I thought i could do with it being plastic so it isn't sharp....but it's not even a claw! It doesn't open! It's like as if it's only got the upper part on it.Huh! well...my son likes it....and I think I can do with it until he starts questioning me about the odd claw!"
13911,4322,5," My grandson loves any Thomas the Tank and decided he had to have Diesel.  I bought Diesel 10 not knowing it was the wrong one. Although he was excited to get him and he fits right in with all the other characters& I will still have to get the correct Diesel.  Why are their names so similar?"
13912,4322,5," Identical to Diesel 10 character on The Day of the Diesels. I couldnt find the toy anywhere in Epsom so I am very grateful to this shop. I received the item two days after placing the order and my son is very happy."
13913,4322,5," our Son wanted this new vehicle"
13914,4322,5," Came quick& great quality. My son loves it!Only downfall is that he's supposed to be a mischievous engine and he's supposed to have a cross looking face but the train doesn't& he looks too friendly"
13915,4322,4," Like most of the take and plays& this die cast Diesel 10 is well made and very detailed. However& like other reviews have mentioned& the claw does not open and close and this was disappointing to my son."
13916,4323,5," I think this is 5 star because the quality of Brio toys is so great !!They all fit onto other carriages and cars."
13917,4323,5," Smaller than expected but good quality. I bought this as a Christmas present so I haven't sent it to Santa yet.Would definitely recommend"
13918,4323,5," The set is just what I expected and will enhance the set I have bought for my grandsons for Christmas!"
13919,4323,5," My grandson aged 22 months loves his brio rail track so this was to add interest to his playing as was the train garage"
13920,4323,4," Bought as xmas present with several other items.  Nice colour bright and grandson loved that there was a animal with it.."
13921,4324,4," Once again poor workmanship seems to let down this range. My 3 year old os a Thomas fan but these Flair trains are so much more flimsy than there originals by Brio. The paint chips and marks simply too easily for the price."
13922,4324,5," Bought for my sons 3rd Birthday and he loves it.Apart from the other engine he got he hasn't looked at anything else.Well worth the money to see the smile on my sons face."
13923,4324,5," It was the next addition for our 3 years olds Thomas Railway set.  We have found the trains to be hardwearing and the paintwork is quite durable given the bashing it takes."
13924,4324,5," Great durable products for all those who love Thomas!  My 2 year old was delighted to add these to his older brothers collection of engines!"
13925,4324,5," Bought on behalf of my new grandson for his big& Thomas-mad& brother.  Did much to ease the shock of the new arrival.  Lovely toy."
13926,4325,5," Lovely train& with working magnetic peice to pick things up with. Can tow another train but magnet isn't that strong... Good for small accessories tho. All in all a great buy."
13927,4326,5," Really pleased..good build quality..really good train from the trackmaster set with some decent carridges..definatly worth paying a little extra for"
13928,4327,5," Fast delivery& excellent quality& extremely durable which is brilliant when you have a crazy 2 year old thomas fanatic!! And I'm so impressed I got Flynn! My Lb is fascinated with being able rescue everything and everyone!! So Flynn will be the perfect addition to his railway collection"
13929,4327,3," Flynn is a decent engine for any wooden railway collection& and my little boy loves it& but my main problem with it are: the road wheels.Flynn can ride on rails or road& but his road wheels here make him clack along the track and *really* struggle with 'sharp' corners& and as a result goes 'slow' (for a fire engine this isn't ideal in an emergency!)Is excellent quality& but the tender has two wheels only which sets it apart from other tenders& and seems to wobble a little back and forth as a result"
13930,4327,5," This toy is very nice.My grandson Daniel loved toy ."
13931,4327,5," One of my son's favourite engines. The ladder tips up and down which is a nice touch. He's quite a tall engine so can be snug with some rail accessories like bridges. Well made."
13932,4327,5," arrived before expected date. present for grandson very pleased."
13933,4327,3," It is plastic where as most of the trains are wooden& personally I prefer the brighter and tougher looking trains also the tender is on 2 wheels so flops around a little bit unlike the tenders of the other trains of similar size but if your child wants a fire engine there is limited choice for you out there& but do shop around for price they vary a lot over the numerous sellers."
13934,4328,5," This was bought to extend an existing train set. We wanted a signal and they don't appear to be sold separately as an accessory& so we bought this set to get one. Our grandson enjoys the signal& but the really popular thing is the train as the tops of the engine and carriage hinge up and there are people who can be put in and out. This has taken his imaginative play to a new level - and is great fun too!"
13935,4328,5," My two and a half year old Grandson absolutely loves this& as he adores |magennets|"
13936,4328,5," Great train set and quite cheap for what it is. My son just loves playing with it. Got this little one to complete other train sets. Just became a brio fan! Thx amazon for putting them on black friday deals"
13937,4328,5," Excellent value for money and delighted my 3 year old who just wanted a train signal to go with his existing brio set - the train and passengers were a great bonus."
13938,4329,5," Good quality for the price& wish it was a little longer to accomodate an engine and carriage but my son loves the tippy action"
13939,4330,4," Stanley feels sturdy and robust which is to be expected with Die-Cast metal. Extended amounts of play has left very little wear and tear. My daughter did take Stanley outside with her once and after one very short play on concrete Stanley's wheels became a bit scuffed and although they do work they don't feel as smooth or spin as well as the other Trains. This confirmed for me that these Trains would have to be indoor toys. Which is a shame as she takes the trains everywhere with her. His livery and paintwork however has remained intact showing very little sign of wear through the extended and continuous play sessions so the product on a whole is still a four stars. Id definitely recommend buying this product over the Stanley in Space figure."
13940,4330,5," Very nice item& good value for money ðŸ™‚"
13941,4330,5," Vvery much loved by a 3 year old."
13942,4331,5," Superb  grandson son loves it will be purchasing other trains from the collection."
13943,4332,4," The Bigjigs Flying Scotsman wooden railway train is a recreation of the legendary steam engine for small children to play with around their wooden tracks.  The model comes with the long engine body plus its tender.  It is an interesting look and a fun colour scheme that does track the original fairly well.  The model as a whole is quite long so can fly a bit if going too fast round corners.The Flying Scotsman recalls the heyday of steam when an exciting journey from London to Scotland on the most famous train.  The name is iconic& its journeys speak to a time now past but which still stir nostalgia among those of us too young to have been part of them.  The Flying Scotsman was the first engine to reach 100mph so a great fun little fact for a parent and child to enjoy.The Bigjigs recreation unfortunately comes with the two small front wheels raised.  This design decision as with some others in the heritage collection is a mistake and makes the toy look uglier than it should.  The body itself is nice.Durability has been good so far with this model having survived over a year with no damage at all.As part of the Heritage Collcetion& the Flying Scotsman is of course a must-have.  It is not perfect but it is a great addition to a small person's wooden railway collection."
13944,4332,5," Well Packaged. and seems good quality. Bought as Christmas gift. Should be received favourably by recipients."
13945,4332,4," Excellent toy engine.  Fully compatible with Brio wooden train set and much appreciated by grandson."
13946,4332,5," Lovely item& bought as a baby shower gift. The soon to be Dad is very happy."
13947,4333,5," I was initially a bit confused over the main difference between the 'Take and Play' and the 'Take Along' range as both use the same type of trains and track. But it seems that Take and Play is more portable in so far as it folds up easier and contains less parts& perhaps it will replace the Take Along range.Anyway& this play set is a fun track - the magnetic items can be hoisted up and lowered using the little crank. The oval track isn't very big but it has a bridge to add some interest& but of course the set can be connected up to any other track in the Take Along/Take and Play range. Cranky is telescopic and simply pushes down into itself to allow the track to fold around it and form an easy to carry bundle. The Salty Engine included can be stored under the bridge and is held in place by the track when folded. This comes with a little cargo-boat too which is a nice addition and allows for even more imaginative play.The oval track isn't made of individual pieces& it is one hinged piece - that makes this incredibly easy to set up and put away. This is perfect to grab and take out if you want to keep your little occupied for a while& you can be fairly certain that you won't lose essential bits!In a nutshell: This is a small Thomas track but it still provides a fair amount of play value. A great toy to take out of the house when young ones may get a bit bored - and a great toy to use at home in conjunction with any other tracks they may have."
13948,4333,5," My boys got this from Santa& and we are very impressed with it. He is much more robust than the older version& and I as a mother& love how easy he is to fold up and put away.Highly recommended."
13949,4333,5," The most interactive of the Tane and Play sets that I've seen& this one works really well. The crane extends to a decent height& the hook winds up and down& the boom lifts and the hook even has a decent strength magnet in it so that it can pick up the supplied barrels. The signal/barrier is a nice feature that acts to hold the kit together when in |take| mode and gives something else to interact with when in |play| mode.My only gripe is the fact  poor old Cranky can collapse without too much pressure& and there's been many an occasion where our little one has been leaning on the crane only to have it |telescope| back down to it's shortest setting. Over time I expect this will become more frequent as the p[lastic wears and friction doesn't do as good a job of holdding it up. It would have been nice if there was a simple locking mechanism that kept things standing tall.All things considerd& it's highly recommended."
13950,4333,5," Cranky is very popular with my 3 year old son and any visiting children make a bee line for him.  As well as the Cranky the crane himself& you get Salty (a diecast engine)& two magnetic barrels and a plastic boat. The hook at the end of the crane contains a magnet so it can pick up engines or barrels. Cranky works quite well as a stand alone toy but also connects with up with other sets eg the bridges and tunnels set Thomas the Tank Engine Bridges"
13951,4333,5," I wasn't impressed that the tracks were assembled to the central unit upside down and they were a nightmare to take part by forcing a metal pin out on each side of the track with a lot of brut force to pull apart and put back together again. Also the cranky crane does not lock together very well when you extend the telescopic tower that it stands on. The one good thing is the crane rope on this is quite strong and the magnetic hook lifts up the cargo but you'll need to get buy some additional pieces to make it entertaining. My son likes it all the same but I think you can do better with some other take along/take and play sets."
13952,4333,4," We are big fans of take n play sets in our household and my nosy love cranky& however now we have owned this for a while& the red little lever is very stiff and is a job for my 3 year olds to turn to get him to lift things up and down with his crane. It is definitely one of the best for packing away and compacting down. Cranky at his maximum height is in 3 sections that lift up and the sides lift up and lock into place also so very good for packing away. Also excellent to see a set not come with a Thomas. This one comes with Salty the diesel. All in all would buy again as you definitely can't have a Sodor without a cranky!"
13953,4333,5," My grandson has hours of fun with this. It is a take and play set so he can take it anywhere....and he does. Tough and durable& it makes a great pressie."
13954,4333,5," This is a good toy as any Thomas (young) fan would shout it out continues& I didn't give it the full 5 stars as the only 'irritating' about this cranky is that it is to quickly pressed in& when brought up to full height if any younger person wants to lift but holds the head it will be pushed down easily making the lifting a delicate job (which I suppose is good for learning 'gentleness' (victor style spoken)).Overall good fun and easily to take anywhere."
13955,4334,4," Much cheaper than the Brio& and if you're not too worried about everything matching (which this does unless you look closely) then this is a fine alternative.The only downside is it doesn't fit as snug as like for like pieces& but again& that's only if you're being REALLY picky"
13956,4334,4," as expected"
13957,4335,5," 10/10"
13958,4336,4," This is one of the newer model Tane-and-Play toys& identifiable by the round magnets. The older models (with the square magnets) tend to be bigger and have more detailed die-cast components. This is certainly true for Hiro - disappointingly& in this version of Hiro all of the |detail| is painted on& and will quickly succumb to the knocks and scratches of day-to-day play.It's a nice engine and what take and play set would be complete without a Hiro& but it's a shame to see the quality of the toys declining so noticeably& when the price remains the same. It's worth looking on e-Bay for some of the older models - you can pick them up cheaper and they're better made as well."
13959,4336,5," This is another great little train for using with the Take'n'Play train sets& we've been collecting these gradually as and when they've been on offer.They are good quality die-cast metal so can handle some pretty rough play at the hands of energetic& enthusiastic and destructive little people.When these trains are on offer& they are good value so 5 stars."
13960,4336,5," My son loves this train. It's wery well made and pretty rugged.The detail is very good. Might end up buying the track and other trains as this is so well recieved.For a small toy it is impressive in its detail and build quality."
13961,4336,4," Great likeness& although suspect some of the body is plastic and not die-cast."
13962,4336,5," Brilliant quality toy for my grandson.  He absolutely loves these& and collects as many as he can.  Can't wait for some more to be released. x"
13963,4336,2," Never arrived unfortunately & bought one in the shop on the end & lovely train and loved by our little one like we thought it would be"
13964,4336,5," Bought for my niece as she loooves anything to do with Thomas. So when I gave her this train she was over the moon."
13965,4336,5," Another take n play engine - my son is Thomas Crazy so is always delighted to have another engine."
13966,4337,5," My 3 year old grandson just loves this train....so does his Daddy lol. Easy to put together with additional sets if wishing to enlarge the system. A good product delivered securely in a prompt and well packaged manner"
13967,4337,4," The Super Komachi model is very accurate and suited for kids. I recommend this for a 3/4 year old child"
13968,4338,5," We waited ages for the chuggington trains to come and at last they are here. We bought one to try it on our wooden train track& but to our disappointment they are too small. Shame as we would have bought many more& but don't want to waste money on yet anothe train track."
13969,4338,5," we bought all the diecast trains for our grandson togther with the roundhouse and extra track. He was over the moon and plays with them constantly. The trains are all very colouful and easy for him to distinguish the different characters. the only downside is that he finds them difficult to join together& but I'm sure he will get the hang of it soon& he is only 2 years old. It would have been helpful to have the engines names printed on the bottom as we have had to print the pictures of the characters from the internet to help us."
13970,4338,5," We have so many of these"
13971,4338,5," wee grandson loves this programwell madee on tv so thought we would get him toys of the series they are safe and solid so he cant come to any harm and they are"
13972,4338,5," I could write a story with all the train my kids have and this one is just brill the kids think this is the best one yet& just pure magic."
13973,4338,5," Great die cast trains& the side opens up to reveal a pretend ice-cream machine& fun to play with& my son loved it"
13974,4338,5," lovely train the detail is amazing& my son was over the moon with it and the value for money was amazing."
13975,4338,5," My son calls him Felini and takes him to bed every night& what better endorsement is there?"
13976,4339,5," Excellent"
13977,4340,5," Fantastic model of an EF510 and trucks. If the locomotive had 2 x 6wheel powered bogies instead of 4 wheels it would not be out of place on a scale model railroad. It came from Japan and was quickly delivered and was extremely well packed. Goes well with the rest of our Tomica layout and makes a nice change from the Bullets we have  (I say |we | 'cos I like it as much as Grandson! ) . As a guide I have seen the real thing in Japan."
13978,4340,5," Excellent  train and  runs brilliant  on the old track  I dug out the loft for my grandson.  Found the newer Trackmaster trains didn't  run so well  on the old style  track but this  flies  along"
13979,4340,4," All in all. Good one except that the links for the coaches are not very sturdy so it keeps getting expanded n comes off !!otherthan that my 2.5 year old loves it"
13980,4340,5," this item arrived slightly earlier than expected& very well packaged indeed& my grandson was very delighted with it& it was part of his birthday present."
13981,4340,4," very good"
13982,4341,5," well made& and the stop start button is now much easier& being a simple press type rather than the sometimes stiff click switches that smaller fingers can struggle with. My son was proud about buying this with some birthday money and he is very happy with it!!"
13983,4341,5," product delivered on time& well packaged and protected& very nice finish to the model& well pleased with it& my grandson loves it."
13984,4341,4," item as described. Came from Japan so delivery was longer than expected"
13985,4341,1," Gets stuck in bends& can only go straight by itself. Very disapointing"
13986,4342,5," Bought Harvey for our Thomas mad 3 year-old grandsons birthday to go with other Thomas Take-N-Play products we'd bought for him. Personally I love the colour!"
13987,4342,5," nice wee train grandson has lots of fun with it"
13988,4342,5," another welcome addition to the engine family"
13989,4342,5," Grandson's comment: he has a good hook ðŸšœ"
13990,4342,5," Great product. Very happy child"
13991,4343,5," Our DD loves Thomas and had requested Belle after reading about her.  It came up to expectations and it played with a lot."
13992,4343,5," Item arrived quickly and as described"
13993,4343,4," Took a while coming but looks fine"
13994,4343,5," My 2 year old grandson has the Thomas train set& his sister is called Isabelle but he can't say it so callers her belle so thought this would be a lovely Christmas present for him"
13995,4344,5," I bought this for my 3 year old son for Christmas. My husband and I set it up in the dining room on Christmas eve night so he would see it when he came downstairs in the morning. We were very impressed with just how big the track and the train really are! Our son absolutely loves it& he loves that the digger and dumper truck are removable and fully working toys.Only criticism& the carriages are a little fiddly to get back on the track and a couple of pieces didn't quite perfectly fit together. Other than that& just wonderful!"
13996,4344,5," Kids enjoy playing with this and me too"
13997,4344,5," Haven't opened yet as it is a present for my son for Christmas but was fast delivery and looks great"
13998,4345,5," Perfect"
13999,4346,4," added to my little boys collection. Trailer doesnt stay attached to the front part very well& but good quality overall"
14000,4347,5," excellent thank you"
14001,4348,5," A beautiful small pristine model& arrived early and well packaged &the wee fella here is 3 -1/2 &this train"
14002,4349,5," As you would expect from Brio& the quality is perfect& much better than some of the copies that some toy shops like to produce and sell& I love that Brio are bringing out new products and this is certainly a great one& it works on the tracks and the little roller just rolls in front& ideal!"
14003,4349,5," 2 yr old grandson will love this& will fit on his railway& and will be carried round and compared with the real thing - haven't given yet& as harvest not quite started - next visit."
14004,4349,4," A little smaller than expected& but goes great with the rest of the train sets& and especially the farm railway set& which I bought for a 3 year old who loves trains."
14005,4349,3," A bit disappointed at the size!  Probably our fault for not checking the measurements. Nevertheless our grandson played with it most of Christmas day"
14006,4349,3," I was a little disapponted with the size& because i thougt it would be bigger... Anyways& i am pleased with my purchase."
14007,4349,5," This little harvester enables children to really explore through play the food cycle and how we get food on our plates!"
14008,4349,5," My godson loves combine harvesters and it was the perfect present as an addition to his train set :) And he loved it !"
14009,4350,4," My daughters favourite film and favourite Thomas outing is Thomas and the Magic Railroad. She absolutely loves it. And one of her favourite Thomas characters of all time is Diesel 10 so buying this was a no brainer. And she does love it& she loves creating adventures and chases around the living room& involving me so im consistently attacked in my own living room by Diesel 10& often having to be saved by who ever is on hand. Its great fun and my daughter does love the product. The claw rotates but doesn't extend or hinge up or down& Pinchy doesn't open and close either which wasn't to much of an issue as its her first Diesel 10 toy so she doesn't know any different and gets along fine using her imagination instead. His paint work and livery have remained intact despite being heavily and roughly played with which is also a good thing.The reason this only gets four stars instead of size is purely because of the size. Diesel 10 is classed as a large engine when purchased so when bought in stores you pay the same price you would for Gordon or Henry. Diesel 10 however is the same size as Thomas and the other small engines. This is disappointing for adults that are forking out the money for him and i could see it disappointing older fans who notice the huge difference in size and end up with a stunted Diesel 10 instead of an intimidating one. He is after all& the big baddy."
14010,4350,5," Bought this for my 3year old grandson to add to his existing train set. He was delighted with it. To me it looked a bit dull in comparison with the other engines& but he knew a lot of the Diesel 10 stories and was over the moon with this little engine& and thanked me many times. It was a really good price and was delivered before the expected date& so I am extremely pleased with this purchase& so is my grandson who hasn't stopped playing with it."
14011,4350,5," This is another great little train for using with the Take'n'Play train sets& we've been collecting these gradually as and when they've been on offer.They are good quality die-cast metal so can handle some pretty rough play at the hands of energetic& enthusiastic and destructive little people.When these trains are on offer& they are good value so 5 stars."
14012,4350,4," As expected and a great price via Amazon lightening deals... The claw on top does nothing apart from swivel round which is a touch dull for little ones"
14013,4350,5," Bought for a Christmas present. Got a great price in the deals and arrived in good condition with no problems."
14014,4350,5," My child who is 4 year old  will not put diesel 10 down as he loves playing with him on and off track."
14015,4350,4," Smaller than I thought it would be & grandson was more than happy with it"
14016,4351,5," Very nice train with three loads. I bought also the little tower crane with the van but unfortunately you cannot put the load of the train on the van because it is a little too long. Attention: it is not fully compatible with Brio. The magnetic crane of Brio can handle the loads of Bigjigs but the crane of Bigjigs can not handle the loads of Brio."
14017,4351,5," A bright& robust and well-made engine and carriages. My 2 and 4 year olds love it.FWI although the track (and bumper) come with the track and are of similar quality - they are not compatable with Ikea track."
14018,4351,5," every thing I have ordered has been for my grandchildren and it scored a hit every time they love every thing about it the colour and the track is so ease to put together when youv got little hands thanks again."
14019,4351,5," What a lovely addition to the grandchildren's train set! The engine and carriages are sturdily built and colourful. The children& aged two and five& have played with it for hours and have really enjoyed it."
14020,4351,5," I bought the fruit and veg train to add to the figure of eight train set.  It's very well made& sturdy and colourful and I think will bring a lot of enjoyment to our grandchildren for a long time to come."
14021,4351,5," My grandson loves this. Enjoys changing the various tops of the carriages. Lots of enjoyment.Very well made and just right for little hands."
14022,4352,5," My grandson  loves all trains and tracks and particularly likes this truck. Constantly adding it to each build and loves the moving mixer."
14023,4352,5," Looks a bit small to me& but my daughter loves it and it fits well in her tiny hands& happy with the purchase."
14024,4352,5," This is my 2yr olds fave toy. He's loves it and it's really nice quality worth the expensive price tag ."
14025,4352,5," Grandson loved this and loved using it with the Brio road track."
14026,4353,4," Beautifully built& does exactly what it says on the box."
14027,4353,5," son loves it- nice addition to his layout"
14028,4353,4," Xmas gift so still in the box"
14029,4353,5," Great price. Good seller"
14030,4353,5," Grandson loves it."
14031,4354,5," I haven&t got Millie yet my 4 year old grandson told me& so how could I not buy him this for him to find in his stocking on Christmas morning. I know he will be thrilled to add Millie to his growing collection of engines."
14032,4354,5," The train arrived quickly and my son was so excited to add this to his collection. The wooden collection is perfect and I'm sure will last for years and will bring many hours of fun."
14033,4354,5," Purchased for my daughter as she wants girl trains on her brothers wooden train set. Lovely little product& well made."
14034,4354,5," My Grandson was over the moon...thank you. Early release of a new engine magic. Keep up the good work please."
14035,4355,5," A great addition to my ds train set and at a reasonable price too"
14036,4355,5," Another addition to my gransons train fun. Great play value."
14037,4356,4," The bits of tarmac are a little difficult for the smaller children to put back together but for the older children it is great. It is a really nice addition to the Brio road and railway track."
14038,4356,5," My 4 year old son loves this piece in his set& what ever size track we make& this one always has to be in it! Great item!"
14039,4356,5," Adds extra interest to my grandsons love of his tracks and trains and always new ideasHours of fun and attention!"
14040,4356,5," excellent quality I cant wait to receive the train set too"
14041,4357,5," Big fans of Chugginton in our house so have started to collect te different die cast toys to make one massive chuggington in our front room. Both my kids love it& boys or girls (men and women) younger and those of us reliving our childhoods through our kids& you cannot go wrong woth a train set!!! The beauty of the chugginton range is that all the bits fit together so you can add to it all the time& have a feeling after chirstmas it may take over the kitchen too!"
14042,4357,5," Brilliant toy my son has lots of fun with this!"
14043,4358,5," This is another great little train for using with the Take'n'Play train sets& we've been collecting these gradually as and when they've been on offer.They are good quality die-cast metal so can handle some pretty rough play at the hands of energetic& enthusiastic and destructive little people.When these trains are on offer& they are good value so 5 stars."
14044,4358,5," Great product for any little avid Thomas and Friends train builder my Lil man loves them all and the track you can buy to go with them are well priced and takes up less then half the space of the wooden stuff"
14045,4358,4," A present for a 3 year old& which made the boy very happy and excited to receive."
14046,4359,5," A fabulous set with tons of track& and the swivel bridge is perfect for baby hands to start exploring how things work."
14047,4359,5," Great value& and very good quality - almost as good as Brio. A great way to supplement the latter!"
14048,4360,5," At first I thought these were expensive for such small things& but when you get them (and especially when the kids get hold of them!) you see just how solidly well made they are.  The Take n Play vehicles are the only Thomas products that I've seen that are really good quality.We have Thomas wooden railway and Mega Bloks Thomas railways& and the Take n Play are definitely my favourite.  The sets are well made too& and survive a great deal of misuse from our toddler without damage - and because every thing is so small and the sets fold up they're very easy to carry around.Another nice touch is that the magnetic couplers work either way& there's none of this constant swapping ends to get things to couple up that you get with the wooden railway series.If we were starting again& we probably wouldn't bother with the wooden railway& and definitely would give the Mega Bloks sets a miss.  The Take n Play sets are all you really need for Thomas obsessed kids& especially if you're short of space and/or need to transport them back and forwards.  You can connect two or more sets together with the extra track pack and end up with quite an interesting little layout which is easy to set up and dismantle and takes very little space when packed away."
14049,4360,5," My son loves everything to do with Thomas.  When he saw a leaflet out of another Thomas product he looked at the pictures on it and asked for Troublesome Truck.  As with all the trains he is sturdy and my son loves him.  I have rated this toy a 5 for educational value not for the truck alone but because my son uses his trucks to make up stories and have great fun stimulating his mind."
14050,4360,5," the toy itself is well made a removable coal load and wobbly chassis i guess to simulate laughing (who knows) dds a little charm to the toy the best thing about these toys is the quality paintwork toughness of the toy worth a fiver yes...you can resell them for near enough the same prcie on ebay that says a lot about the product"
14051,4360,5," Very good& Dillon enjoys them along with all the other Take and Play trains. Service excellent and commended to all."
14052,4360,3," The truck arrived quickly but it had the load shown in the listing missing"
14053,4361,5," This pack of two pieces of flexible track are very versatile. They are great for tight spots and creative track designs. You can also put things under the track to make it lumpy and bumpy& for the trains to have a crazy adventure. These tracks are used in all track designs and layouts now. My son loves them and they have not been destroyed by him yet. The engines love travelling on these. These are compatible with most train tracks."
14054,4361,5," We'd never seen anything like this before we bought it. It was a Christmas present for our 3 year old grandson who has lots of track already but never enough! It fitted in with his other track perfectly& and he thought it was great."
14055,4361,5," This track is really fun to use and great for making circuits join up easily!  Works fine with our assortment of different track (Brio& Tesco& Ikea etc.)"
14056,4361,5," You know when you build a wooden track and you get to the end and nothing seems to fit? Then much to your toddlers frustration you have to demolish half the track to then find a way of making it all fit only to find you need more curved pieces or more straight pieces? Well this piece of track sorts out that! Two pieces come in the pack. The piece seems sturdy and the wood is good quality. We have been playing with it daily for two months and it looks as good as new. This says a lot as my toddler can be heavy handed& as they all can! Lots of tracks to be made with this! Highly recommend."
14057,4361,5," This bit of flexible track makes so much sense and makes the whole track building process so much less frustrating as now it is so much easier to finish tracks. Other parents have asked where we have got it and seen it as the new must have for wooden railway tracks"
14058,4361,4," This was bought to compliment an existing railway system and fits in very nicely. It can be used to connect some parts of a track that other parts just cannot stretch to.  It is very forgiving of any poor track designs.  I will be ordering another pack soon.  Good quality product"
14059,4361,4," These are really good fun and a good way to spice up any wooden train track. My 3 year old uses them everyday with his train set and has thought of countless different ways to use them. Brill!"
14060,4361,5," Our 3 year old Grandson is mad on Thomas and trains in general. We bought him the Bigjigs railway set last year and found it to be value for money and very well made. Since then we have been adding bits to it to extend the track and also make it more interesting. We have also invested in more trains and they are really lovely. Fab make and fab prices& very much enjoyed and will be played with by our two Grandaughters Im sure."
14061,4362,4," Good for adding some interest to my 3 year olds track. We use duplo as supports but you can also buy wooden supports. My son was very pleased with them."
14062,4363,3," Nice toy ordered and delivered quickly& unfortunately i wrapped it and gave it to my son before opening and checking the toy only for him to open it and to be very upset as the tracks were both broken but concealed under the toy until he'd ripped the box open. very disappointed"
14063,4363,5," This was a Christmas present for a friend's son and I am told& was very well received. Arrived quickly and well packaged. No issues that would prevent me from ordering again."
14064,4363,5," Thomas and Friends are so totally real to my little grandson and each engine gives him hours of fun. Excellent quality and price."
14065,4363,4," One of my favorite Thomas characters& in wooden form!Nicely detailed and the caterpillar tracks are a nice feature."
14066,4364,5," my son has alot of wooden track and thomas trains&i saw this and thought he would like it as he also likes chuggington. Koko is bigger then the thomas trains but still fits perfectly on the same track and connects to his thomas trains too. Although its wooden the front part (face) of Koko is plastic compared with the thomas range being all wooden- despite this it makes no difference to my son who was pleased to see Koko. She doesn't go over the briges well& getting stuck at bottom& but i don't have the chuggington wooden track maybe it's different. Also the train was cheaper then thomas range and bigger despite being from the same learning curve range."
14067,4364,5," My son is obsessed with trains& and he especially loves his wooden train track. Koko is much bigger than his other wooden trains however it fits upon his wooden track perfectly& we only had a problem with it going through a tunnel& however this is on standard track and accessories not Chuggington ones. Koko consists of a wooden face and the remaining part being plastic."
14068,4364,5," Very nice& cute chugger. Feets any wooden trail. I'm very pleased with it. Finely made but light enough for 3 year old hands"
14069,4364,4," Great toy & although slightly large to get through some tunnels made by other wooden train set brands."
14070,4364,5," It is what it is and just what my Grand daughter wanted she is very happy with it!"
14071,4364,5," Happy little choppy playing with this on his wooden railway. Fits fine"
14072,4365,5," I bought this item for my nephew& It is exactly as described& He'll love it!"
14073,4365,5," My boy enjoyes playing with thomas and friends toys."
14074,4365,5," these are always a hit with my 3 year old grandson."
14075,4365,4," Nice little train. Harry likes it."
14076,4366,3," looking at this producted it was not what it looks like&my son still enjoys playing with it but it not so good as the other chuggingtons I had"
14077,4366,5," Very good value gives my grandson a lot of enjoyment"
14078,4366,5," Very good service and toy"
14079,4366,5," good value for money"
14080,4366,5," As described"
14081,4367,5," My son loves this little engine. Seeing the pistons move as it rolls along is endlessly fascinating& either on the track or on a table-top. |It's chuffing!| he exclaims. After the disappointment of battery-powered engines that left him far too passive (just watching the train go around) it's great to see him getting closely involved in the action again."
14082,4367,5," As there were only two& negative reviews here& I feel compelled to balance this out a little. Our one works perfectly& with a gorgeous and smooth piston movement finishing what is a lovely miniature locomotive. I hope that the broken ones that others have received are by far the minority as I too would expect Brio to have high standards."
14083,4367,5," Beautifully made& enchanting reciprocating action. Bought for a toddler (nearly three) who absolutely loves it. Brio always seems to offer better quality than 'compatible brands' and this is no exception."
14084,4367,1," This toy was broken when it arrived. A screw was missing from the under side which means that the whole train falls apart when pushed along a track. Very disappointing& especially from Brio."
14085,4367,5," My son is 4 and a half& bought the farm pack and extension pack and this train he plays with it for hours and will do for many years to come"
14086,4367,3," Classic brio train& just a little smaller than anticipated and who go something a little bigger next time. Especially as it was a gift"
14087,4367,4," All my son wanted was a black train! Kept going on"
14088,4368,4," Thanks"
14089,4369,5," Bought at the same time as Percy (the green one) and keeps our grandson pleasantly occupied for ages. Fits perfectly on the Brio track. Yet another Thomas the Tank Engine generation has begun in our family."
14090,4369,5," I bought this for my son's second birthday. He loves it and as a result it's been on some perilous journeys. However& the quality is high and Thomas seems to hold up well to knocks& drops and scrapes.Thomas runs well on any of the usual wooden train sets such as Brio& Bigjigs etc."
14091,4369,5," Arrived very quickly. Well made. My nephew loves it. This fits onto other wooden railway toys and can be used with other toy trains."
14092,4369,5," Good price for this item& Thomas always speaks for itself& well made& easily wipes clean and works well on all wooden train sets"
14093,4369,5," My little one loves this little Thomas& really good quality. Will take the bashings it will be getting from my two year old!"
14094,4369,2," The Thomas"
14095,4369,5," Bought while taking advantage of a little price cut... After being stung on a well known auction site with a counterfeit set of Thomas merchandise I felt assured I was getting a genuine Thomas. Good quality and a big hit in my 3 year old Christmas stocking."
14096,4369,4," Looks good& more of that later& after tested by nephew.  What I couldn't find was its size: it's about 9 cms long and 5 cms high.  Stating the size of the packaging& as it does on the page& doesn't help me visualise how a child might play with it!"
14097,4370,5," Very happy with the product."
14098,4371,4," Thomas"
14099,4371,3," This Thomas set is very well made and is on par with the usual quality of Thomas the tank engine products. It is& as these sets usually are& to a different scale from others& but there are track extensions you can purchase to increase your take and play Thomas world& but of course it is always extra outlay.This is basically a lever operated toy& where you place Thomas in the head of the snake& push down the lever and the snake head rotates up and around the centre& taking Thomas up to the track& where he then rolls back down into the snake head at the bottom& and you repeat. There isn't really much more to it than that and whilst it is fun at first& it does not really maintain a child's attention after several repeats and I believe it gets quite boring to be honest.I also feel that whilst it has a carry handle& it is still quite a bulky piece to carry around and there is nowhere to put Thomas to carry him with the track& so he has to be carried separately anyway& so it is not a carry all solution and is overplaying it's |take and play| image just a little bit.So& over all& it is a toy that will entertain your child for a short while& but it's repetitive nature will quickly become boring& it has no sounds& which may be nice for parents& but just makes it less entertaining to me."
14100,4371,2," After an initial leap of excitement from our three-year-old& we were quickly left a bit underwhelmed by this toy. The novelty wore off quickly- it is a |one trick| toy& basically it's just a lever& and once you've used the lever a few dozen times& there really isn't much more to enjoy in it.Thinking about the plusses... it's well made and sturdy& and light-weight. The Thomas figure is a nice little object in itself& and can obviously be played with on its own. The fact no batteries are involved is always a bonus- it means it can't make any annoying repetitive noises.Having not seen the recent Thomas movie (assuming it's connected to that)& I'm afraid I don't see the connection between Thomas the Tank Engine and a giant snake ride anyway. It's like they got confused between Thomas The Tank Engine and Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom. It doesn't seem to make any sense story-wise even as a |Snake Ride Exhibit|.I think the |take-n-play| aspect is a bit overstated as well. Yes this toy is marginally easier to carry around than some other toys& because of the fact you can use the lever handle as a carry handle& but you still have to carry around the Thomas engine. Making a major sales point out of the fact that it's moderately easy to carry seems like scraping the barrel a bit.We already have one Thomas rail toy- part of the Trackmaster set- and this is a completely different scale& so there's no compatibility between the two (we understood this already& but our three-year-old found that a bit confusing).Read more â€º"
14101,4371,3," My three year-old son is obsessed by everything Thomas and was beaming from ear to ear when this arrived for him. It was very quick to assemble and easy for a small boy to operate (you push down the handle to make the serpent swing round the central pole) however there were a couple of disappointments . Firstly despite the fact the train track looks remarkably similar to our plastic Thomas and friends train set (http:"
14102,4372,5," This product (supplied by Mail Order Express) came in a big wooden box - useful for storage when not in use.  All 130 pieces were present and correct.  A couple of the pieces need a small amount of assembly that I managed easily with as small cross-head screwdriver.  The whole thing feels wonderfully solid& it's all wood except for the sides of the bridge.  It comes with two trains and just numerous little people& trees& some houses.  It's got a simple crane with a magnet to pick up cargo from the train trucks.  It's got a turntable& bridges& a tunnel - you name it!  It arrived 2 months before Christmas and I can't wait to give it to my toddler so I'll have to store it at my Mum's to prevent myself getting it out for him sooner.  I know he's going to love it."
14103,4372,5," Just bought this for my son who is train/car obsessed. Very impressed& lots of track& 3 bridges& 2 levels& a tunnel& station and crane& plus lots of trains/other vehicles& trees and houses. Required some screwing to assemble& but straightforward and clear instructions how to set up. Quite large when assembled& planning to make a play table to keep it on. Other standard trains we already had fit on very well also."
14104,4372,4," I have purchased this over Christmas at a great price (almost 2/3 off!) and it has proven a great success with the little ones (and the grown ups). We have extented the set with a couple of other BRIO compatible sets and managed to create a very enjoyable toy.The product is only let down by the lack of bulding instructions or examples. You have to use your imagination (which is stimulating for the kids i agree!) or try to mirror the design on the box& but that proved challenging..Enjoy!"
14105,4372,4," This is a top quality train set! You can add to it and the pieces are sturdy. Negative points are minimal but the wooden beading on the box came off very easily and because it's a sliding lid& the support on one side of the box also broke early on. It could also do with having more straight track pieces for when your child wants to make his/her own track layout."
14106,4372,5," This is really excellent toy that was a gift for my nephew who absolutely loves it. He plays all the time with it and the wooden pieces are really endurable. I would warn that this is rather heavy toy and it comes in a wood box that is very useful storage space."
14107,4373,4," Very cute& will be great for our little man to understand Daddy's journey to work."
14108,4373,5," Excellent toy my little girl loves ir"
14109,4374,1," Not happy atal my son was so excited to recieve this train on Christmas and it did not work atal my partner took neally an hour to fix this& this is completely unacceptable to buy something brand new and to not work on Christmas Day of all days. This is the 3rd new design trackmaster that hasn't worked these new designs and crap compared to the old style trackmaster."
14110,4374,5," grandson is delighted with ryan engine.since he saw it in cinema he has wanted one."
14111,4374,2," The track is not included but it doesn`t say so in the description"
14112,4374,5," Bought for Christmas and played with none stop since then"
14113,4374,5," My son love it. Really nice engine"
14114,4374,5," Got it before time very happy"
14115,4375,5," This is surely the most fun you could get your little boy or girl for christmas. And Daddy loves it too& in fact this is a great addition to any Brio set& the number of designs that this allows you to conjure up is great. Hours of engineering fun!"
14116,4375,5," Brio toys are really well made& and this set is another example of it. We bought it for Christmas for our 3 years old and he loves it& he plays with it everyday. It is compatible with the Ikea set we have& although the Brio set of my neighbour with her Ikea set do not fit as well. It took a week to arrive and it came well packed. I wish it came in the big Brio plastic storage boxes like other sets."
14117,4375,5," Love Brio and all the sets they offer. Wonderful set my 4 yr old loves it& was soo anxious to set it up."
14118,4376,4," Cute and nimble for little fingers.  My little boy loves this new addition to his collection.paint does chip easily tho with toddler play."
14119,4376,5," This little train was fantastic for my 3 year old nephew. He is a massive fan of Thomas and the Take-n-Play collection& he must have all of them!As boys are& they like to throw their toys and he is no different to these. As they are made from die cast metal& they definately don't break or shatter upon impact with any surface.Great product for the little ones at a fantastic price."
14120,4376,5," I bought this to supplement my sons Thomas collection and have not regretted it.  These are very detailed die cast trains.  I purchased Dash& Bash and Ferdinand to supplement the existing magnetic couplings of his other take-n-play trains.  I highly recommend these.  My son loves to play with these as he watches the Misty Island Rescue movie."
14121,4376,5," My young grandson has a great collection of these die cast metal trains but could not find the ones I ordered here. He will be so excited when he opens them on Christmas day. He has many gifts but these will be very special. Beautifully made and speedy delivery. Will be buying the last few to make up his collection."
14122,4376,5," anybody who has a pre school lad in the family will know the importance of a good thomas collection!!Ferdinand is a must and you cant beat the take and play engines."
14123,4376,5," A great purchase as my 4 year old boy loves Thomas and using these trains on his take-n-play tracks.  I would recommend this as it is well made"
14124,4376,5," satisfactory received the item when expected new itemgrandson very happy. Have not seen the item personallyso cannot comment further"
14125,4376,5," to my sons growing Thomas the tank Engine Die Cast collection& he loves them all& the purchase and the delivery had no glitches&"
14126,4377,5," These are everything you would expect from brio& really I just wanted to do a review to say my toddler (2yr) thinks these are great.  For the other reviewers that couldn't see what the ramps are for - they are so you can take trains off the rails!  Probably not great for an older child who should know the trains go on the tracks& but as a younger child is learning this and still getting to grips with laying their own tracks these help give an element of freedom to take the train down onto the floor without crashing it.Great addition to our set."
14127,4377,5," These pieces provide a neat ending to trailing bits of track. 2 buffers to stop the trains& 2 ramps to neatly lead trains off-track and onto the carpet. Fab for use with battery-powered trains (kids find it hilarious when train wanders off on its own).Bought because I wanted buffers& on arrival of product at first I was totally confused how to actually make use of the pieces& but thanks to explanations from other reviewers I'm now delighted with my purchase! Great quality as you would expect from Brio."
14128,4377,5," Nice little addition to our BRIO set.  Allows son to play on carpet with train& then go on and off the track.  The end stop is also useful for when you have odd pieces of track that do not join up.  BEWARE package is very small."
14129,4377,5," Bought it for ~5Â£& I think it's an acceptable price for useful pieces like these& as it's easy to end up with dead end tracks in most improvised layouts!"
14130,4377,2," Stops are excellent but the ramps have been fairly useless. Would be better if could just buy the ones you actually want."
14131,4377,5," My son loves this as it has helped him make different tracks without my help and not having to make circular tracks&"
14132,4377,5," Hours of fun have been had with this high quality good product. It is as described and good value. Very pleased."
14133,4377,3," The buffers are great but the ramps seem surplus. I would buy again as my boys love the idea of buffers."
14134,4378,5," Lovely little train& my grandson loves it& he has two one at home and one here. It is special to him& because he really enjoys going to the Bluebell Railway to ride on the steam trains."
14135,4378,5," OUR 18MTH OLD GRANDSON LOVED IT. AN EXCELLENT ADDITION TOHIS BRIO RAILWAY AND A GREAT REMINDER OF OUR FAMILY VISIT TO THE BLUEBELL LINE"
14136,4378,5," 100% success&  much loved and used by my grandson. I have bought several Bigjigs rail items& all well received."
14137,4379,5," An excellent addition for my sons Thomas set. Bought this to put into his layout in place of the tipping hill from the avalanche set& he absolutely loves it. THe avalanche was a pain as it was always falling out of line with the other track.With a bit of careful planning you can have more than 1 level of track going through this hill."
14138,4379,5," Hour's and hour&s my grandson JACK has played with this."
14139,4379,5," I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 5 year old nephew and he absolutely loved it. It's so fun even the adults were enjoying it! It's easy to assemble and works with all the Thomas trains."
14140,4379,4," cant say much as I will give it to my grandson when I visit the family in Spain in June he loves all Thomas engines ect.&hopefully it will be as good as it looks."
14141,4379,5," Grandson loves it and is also better at assembling it than grandad!"
14142,4379,5," Bought this for my grandson and he loves it"
14143,4379,4," Great gift for my Grandson he Loves it."
14144,4379,5," hi ti come to day thank you 55"
14145,4380,5," This toy keeps my 2&5 year old busy playing alone up up an hour! Great qualit& sturdy and did not collapse when my toddler stood on it. I recommend this toy to others."
14146,4380,5," This is good quality as is all the Brio products& sturdy& lovely colours and I am sure my grandson will love this to add to his collection."
14147,4380,5," Our grandson& who is 3& loved it as he needed a |garage| for his train.  As with all Brio- very well made and worth the money.  I have Brio trains that are 30 yrs old and they look new."
14148,4380,5," Extremely well made& larger than expected& just need to clip the doors on and it's ready to go."
14149,4380,5," Fantastic addition to my son's brio railway set. A little pricey but is solid and well made."
14150,4381,5," Fantastic tractor at a great price& arrived on time and well packaged. Great for little hands to get working& love it"
14151,4381,5," Very good value& quality and service."
14152,4381,5," excellent item&great price"
14153,4382,4," GOOD ......GRANDSON DELIGHTED"
14154,4383,4," I bought this for my great nephew who is nearly two to go with his Bruder Tractor.  It is well made& very functional and is not difficult for him to learn how to use it and connect it to the tractor.  He plays with it frequently and so far it has stood up well to his activities."
14155,4383,5," The Bruder tipping trailer is very good looking and quite large (we already have the Bruder Land Rover and it looks a bit small next to the trailer). Our son loves it since he can put many toys in it and play. The quality is also excellent and after several falls it still has no damage."
14156,4383,5," I'm new to Bruder and this Christmas my son received a Tractor and a Land Rover and he adores them.  This trailer is a perfect addition to his new collection.  I love the size of these items and how easily the trailer fits both [and so I read& all] the items in the Bruder range.  He is 2 1/2 and is tractor mad& these are great for his little paws to use and exceedingly solid and will easily take his crashings and bashings."
14157,4383,5," I bought this trailer to go with the tractor& same brand& as a Christmas present for my grandson who is mad keen on tractors and big machinery.  A lot of model tractors for this price were small had little details that looked as if they might fall off with a toddlers enthusiasm& this one is bigger than you imagine and sturdy.  Obviously it hasn't been road-tested yet."
14158,4383,4," My son got this to go with his Jonh Dere tractor on his third birthday. So far I watched him fill it with just about everything& he plays with it and plays with it. Great toy and a great scale"
14159,4383,5," Excellent trailer& folding sides and manual tipper& little boy very happy filling it with blocks. Sides can also be used as ramps to load skid steer."
14160,4383,5," Perfect accessory for our Bruder Tractor! Excellent quality and great fun to carry things at the back of the tractor...!"
14161,4383,5," An excellent accessory for my 2 year old grandson's tractor.He loves it& and it's proved to be very robust."
14162,4384,5," Really well made and packaged.  Lovely product for adults and children alike!  Would be tricky for younger children though given the size of the pieces.  Great service too - thanks!"
14163,4384,5," I actually bought this for my husband so the very small pieces proved tricky but he had hours of fun putting it together& loved it so much I ordered the Meerkats too."
14164,4384,5," Perfect item for keeping your mind occupied"
14165,4384,5," This is a fantastic must for any cat lover or collector of cat stuff! Its brill fun to build but you need good eye sight or like me your specs on.  My son bought it for my birthday to go with my collection of cat figures.  After about 3 attempts I got it built.  I looked for more designs but sadly this seams to be the only cat lego available. If given as a toy it would need to be for a child over 8."
14166,4384,5," Tiny cat - ideal if you have a small house or are allergic to cat hairs.  Zero cat food bill so a winner :-)"
14167,4384,5," Bought this for a cat lover and was a great addition to a birthday present. She has not made it yet but will take a picture once I get one."
14168,4385,5," just what I wanted great value.it would make a great display model."
14169,4385,5," Good"
14170,4386,5," In Cornwall we have no big toy shops my grandson wanted a low loader or car transporter this took ages to find.  When I got it I played with it and found lots of little hidden things to do with it.  There is a winch that can go on the front or back& and a secret tool box underneath.  Kids love this great for exploring& my grandson is six."
14171,4386,4," The recovery truck is excellent quality& but the Jeep you get with this is very low quality and not what I was expecting from bruder."
14172,4386,5," Great toy my little girl loves it& ours came with flashing light set as well."
14173,4387,5," Highly recomended"
14174,4387,5," good"
14175,4388,5," This metal die-cast bus is well made and durable. The doors open when pushed and seem unlikely to break. Give it a push and it moves a long way across smooth flooring. A good balance between a toy and a model for boys under 10. It immediately became my grandson's best bus. Shipping not fast but worth waiting for."
14176,4388,5," COLOUR WAS NOT AS ILLUSTRATED& THOUGH THAT DID NOT SEEM TO BOTHER MY 5 YEAR OLD GRANDSON. WHO WAS THRILLED TO BITS ON HIS BIRTHDAY. A VERY REALISTIC TOY. WELL MADE AND WITH OPENING DOORS TOO."
14177,4389,4," I got this for my 2 year old nephew and he absolutely adores it.I wasn't sure how big it would be when I ordered it so was pleasantly surprised when it was larger than I expected. Perfect for a 2 year old to get his hand around the top of the cabin to push it.He hasn't stopped playing it with since! All in all& given me some great auntie brownie points :)"
14178,4389,5," Our just 3 year old loves it plays with t loads. The hook for the trailer is quite little and fiddly and he got frustrated a lot at first but after a while he worked out how to attach it. It doesn't stay done up for long on carpet though.But he loves it so I'm happy."
14179,4389,3," A great price but the trailer does seem a tad flimsy. Had to mend the trailer quite a few times and it doesn't stay attached very well. But that said it is a well loved toy for my grandson."
14180,4389,5," purchased two one for my grandchildren and one for my nephews daughter. they all love playing with their farm animals and this was ideal an ideal size for them."
14181,4389,5," Very pleased with this purchase& great value for money. Prompt delivery as usual. We bought this as a present for a friends grandchild& he was over the moon."
14182,4389,5," I bought this tractor for my sons 2nd birthday& he loves it. It is very durable and rolls/drives really well. It is one of his favourites and survives being battered!! Great tractor and very realistic to the real thing."
14183,4389,4," Nice looking tractor.  Easy for my three year old to manoeuvre.  Improves hand/eye coordination as linking tractor and trailer is a bit fiddly.  Overall very good product at reasonable price"
14184,4389,3," Great pressie just spoilt by having to pay postage and The Entertainer didnt have any in the shops to collect but had plenty on Amazon so win win for them but not for the customer."
14185,4390,5," Great product and very fast delivery!"
14186,4391,4," Bought this for my grandson who is mad about trucks& great buy. b b b b b b b b"
14187,4391,5," really strong& so great for kids that love throwing things around. did what it says and  more. has lasted for years now. well worth the money& as can be passed down from one child to another"
14188,4391,5," My son has recently bought the real thing - this was the next best thing for my grandson - lovely"
14189,4391,5," Great detail and very well made"
14190,4392,5," Great fun& suitable for 3 year-old - only downside is that some small toys have been vanishing into the mixer!  He loves it."
14191,4392,4," Firstly this toy is MASSIVE. I had other Bruder at 1:16 but didn't realise this one is so large (even though it did state 58cm). The drum is well designed but being so large& none of his digger could actually reach the top of the opening. When I bought it the description had wrongly said the head tilt forward to reveal the engine although they subsequently remove this as it doesn't. The size kinda encourage the kid to sit on it so just as well that the overall Bruder quality is good but unfortunately the red crank handle is now broken."
14192,4392,5," My 3yr old nephew loved it.. Great size loads of detail and very sturdy. So pleased we chose this present for him"
14193,4392,5," Purchased as an Xmas present for my four year old son. I wouldn't buy any other brand than bruder& we have bought several garbage trucks in the past and the quality has always been exceptional and the cement mixer is no different. It's massive and great value for money in my opinion."
14194,4392,5," Great toy! My 4year old son got it for his birthday he loves it! Very Well made and really worth the money.i will definatly be buying more bruder toys!"
14195,4392,5," VERY ROBUST TOY WITH LOTS OF FUN IN TURNING THE CEMENT MIXER. WILL BE GREAT TO ADD SAND AND WATCH IT COME DOWN THE SHUTES. I KNOW THIS TOY WILL PROVIDE HOURS OF FUN AT CHRISTMAS AND LONG AFTER. ALSO PURCHASED THE LIGHT AND SOUNDS MODULE TO ADD EVEN MORE FUN WITH FLASHING LIGHTS AND SIRENS"
14196,4392,5," Brilliant toy.  My son has had hours of fun playing with this cement mixer.  Made well."
14197,4392,5," Bought as a Christmas present for my grandson. He loves it! Very well made and tough."
14198,4393,5," I bought this for my nephew and it had stood the test of wear and tear well and it is easy to get extras locally"
14199,4394,5," An interesting selection for vehicle-mad boys. They are plastic rather than metal& so initially i did not have high hopes for them lasting long& but in fact they are proving tough and are played with constantly."
14200,4394,5," The first time I found out about Siku die-casts was in Hamburg airport when during a transit flight I purchased a garbage truck for my 2 year old son. It cost around Â£3-4& but its detail and quality were far above the average die-casts. My son absolutely loved it and played with it relentlessly. The truck sustain the abuse although eventually the hinges of the tipper door broke. At this point I looked online and purchased this set that I found very reasonably priced. Surely enough& the quality of the rest of the vehicles matched that of the garbage truck. They have all been well played although again the garbage truck hinges have suffered some damage. Overall& a top notch die cast set that can survive the abuse of a small child and definitely cherished by an older child."
14201,4394,5," This pack of small trucks is hours of fun for my wee man. A definate buy for any boy& my wee man is 22 months and loves these."
14202,4394,2," Son loves it however there are lots of small parts that have been taken off to avoid or son choking on and the digger second from bottom broke first day with the plastic spade bit& pity as Siku make top class products."
14203,4394,5," My son loves these & well made and a great size for little hands.  I will definitely order more siku"
14204,4394,5," Great product& price and delivery cant ask for more ty"
14205,4395,5," ok"
14206,4396,5," Looks good & bought for great nephews birthday so cannot give any evaluation on this product at this time."
14207,4396,2," Flimsy rubbish."
14208,4396,5," brilliant"
14209,4397,5," This is what my little boy has asked for since last christmas.  At last he's going to get it this year!!  As always& Bruder toys are good robust toys."
14210,4398,4," Bought for my 7 year old son. A bit smaller than I expected but he is thrilled with it and I'm quite impressed with the crane function which has a clever mechanism that stops the winch from unwinding which my son can easily work. My only complaint would be that the metal stabilises that slide out from the side are not as sturdy as the rest of the toy and one has already bent slightly (during a fall) so it doesn't slide back into place as smoothly any more. Doesn't stop the play though and he has played with it every single day since it arrived 3 weeks ago."
14211,4398,5," Really stable and well made product. My 6 year old loves it - can actually play with it - much more than a push along. 8 year old says |Why didn't I get one?|"
14212,4398,5," Well happy with this and would come back for more he had lot tpys to see so cant go wrong thank you"
14213,4399,5," I got this for my 2 and half year old boy who has a truck and specifically a rubbish truck fixation for Christmas. He absolutely bloody loves it. Played with it solidly for over 2 hours without interruption which for him is amazing. Great build and very realistic. A quality toy& thoroughly recommended."
14214,4399,5," Highly recommend this truck. My 3 year old son absolutely loves it. Quality and detail outstanding. It's sturdy and strong. As soon as my little boy has gone to bed& daddy also has endless hours of fun"
14215,4399,5," We got this for our bin-lorry-obsessed son's second birthday& and now 2 and a half it is still his favourite toy. It's well built and realistic. One of the features that makes it extra special is that the doors open and you can fit playmobil people inside the cab to drive it. The people can also hold the wheelie bins too. It's splendid. I'd highly recommend it."
14216,4399,4," Great & hours of entertainment. The gears on the winding mechanism do slip and make a grinding noise& I emailed Bruder and they were fantastic and replied with a solution to stop this noise. There is a tiny tiny hole on the side of the truck where the gears are internally. They suggest add a drop of oil through this hole. Now it is perfect !"
14217,4399,5," My son loves bin lorries. He had wanted a truck like this for awhile. Would rather have had a front loader but you can't get them in the UK which is a great missed opportunity. He loves how it all works the bins the crusher etc. One downside is because it is so big it is difficult to steer around especially as the front wheels do not steer but are fixed in a straight line. Otherwise recommended."
14218,4399,5," What a great item. I am always pleased when my grandson brings this round to play ! Great scale& well built& and all the functionality of the real thing. My wife and I spent an afternoon making up |waste| and boy do the boys (one being me) like filling the bins and empting into the Dustcart ! Buy the additional bins as an extra. Childhood again !!!"
14219,4399,5," I bought this toy for my 5 year old boy who is mad about anything with wheels. He absolutely loves it& as it is just like the real big one which he saw in the summer. It was rather expensive but it is very well built and robust and hopefully will last the length of time in order for him to enjoy it"
14220,4399,5," My grandson has now had this item for nearly 2 years. He absolutely loves it (nearly 5 now) and plays with it in so many games. Well worth buying the extra dustbins. This is one toy that has been well played with and therefore really good value."
14221,4400,1," Very disappointed with this trailer when on Xmas day as my 6yr old Grandson removed it from its packaging and unfolded the 2 spraying arms they proved so flimsy that one completely snapped at the hinge. He was devastated . Could do with receiving a replacement spraying arm"
14222,4400,5," I choose a five star rating as I was so pleased when it arrived. I bought it or my grandson who absolutely loves it."
14223,4400,5," As described. A welcome addition to my model farm. Delivered swiftly. No problems."
14224,4401,5," Exellent"
14225,4402,5," bought this for my three year old son for Christmas& its one of his favourites. great toy seems very durable also. he dropped it the other day by accident on to our tiled floor. I thought it had broken& thankfully nothing broke at all."
14226,4402,5," Brought this for my 3yr old farm machinery mad boy& had a couple of the bruder tractors but this was the first tele handler& my son nearly passed out with excitement! I love the way these toys are made& if they do ever pop apart they are so easy to 'pop back in'! But that's rare I would say& very pleased and look forward to getting the Manitou next!! God someone buy me a lottery ticket!!?"
14227,4402,3," I got this for my lad who is not quite 3 years old& (it does say that it's suitable for 3+ year olds).  It looks great& plenty of detail and a good number of moving parts which is where it the construction of it lets it down.  The digger arm moves up& down and extends by turning or winding knobs and handles on the digger& same deal with the bucket.  Ours no longer work as my lad as snapped and broken them by trying to pull these things up& down& in and out& as he hasn't quite mastered the technique to operate them.  If I'd waited until he was 3 would it make any difference& I really don't think it would.  So be careful if your young one is quite rough and tumble this is probably not going to last& unless they are older& 5 or 6 perhaps and can operate the controls without snapping them off."
14228,4402,5," My son really likes this toy and plays with it a lot. He got it for Christmas. So far so good.  Seems well made and does lots of things. Doors open& scoop moves and arm extends. Appears to be a good toy for the price."
14229,4402,5," Was purchased as a gift and was very well recieved. Provided hours and hours of fun for my 5 year old nephew. Very well made and I am sure it will bring years of more fun digging up his garden!"
14230,4402,5," My Grandsons favourite toy - but they are careful 2 and 4 year olds - if children are a bit rough they would break some of the more delicate aspects like wing mirrors!"
14231,4402,2," Arived with the nob broken and missing off the telescopic arm& cost too much to chance sending it back and I couldn't really take a present back to return. ."
14232,4402,3," When I bought the telehandler for my son I thought it would be the same size as the Manitou telehandler& but it is in fact smaller."
14233,4403,5," Have only had for a few weeks so can't comment on longevity but the kids (1 and 4) both love them! They play music and light up and race very fast.  THe kids love racing them across the floor.  They appeal to all ages too."
14234,4403,5," Great toy& my almost 2 year old loves it!"
14235,4403,5," Great little car.... Well worth the money"
14236,4403,4," present for xmas for grandson"
14237,4404,5," Great make. Great quality. Still a well used item by my grandson. All good."
14238,4405,5," Excellent toy!"
14239,4406,5," I'm happy. Exactly what I wanted. Thank you."
14240,4407,5," Excellent quality toy for 1-2 year old boy or girl. My son's got a few Bruder toys. Bought them on sale so very happy with the price I paid and the quality of the toys. Speedy delivery as well."
14241,4408,5," Really happy with purchase speedy delivery"
14242,4409,5," Son bought himself 1 of these on a day trip out and has great fun with it&so ordered some more for Birthday presents&excellent value for money."
14243,4409,5," Bought one of these cars for my Grandson who absolutely loved it Goes fast and even runs on carpet Only problem was that the axil bent on a wheel when it fell off a table so ordering another one !  Great fun and would recommend"
14244,4409,5," Bought yet again and all the kids love them!! Cheap and will keep kids amused for hours turn the lights out and watch there faces light up!!!"
14245,4410,4," An excellent purchase that I'm very pleased with. The game is well designed& the instructions are clear and precise enough to get playing straight away.The complexity of the game is well pitched so that you can pick up the basics straight away& making it very accesible& but the level of strategy is deep enough so that you will develop new tricks and moves along the way to increase it's longevity.It's also incredibly addictive& which is not bad thing as it challenges you to use your brain power not only to plot your own moves& but to try to counteract your opponent also.There are several different starting positions& each with varying balance between attack and defence. Having played the game a number of times I'm confident to say that it does not seem to get repetitive& and game rarely follow the same pattern. The |Eye of Horus| add on is a great purchase& slightly expensive for an extra 2 pieces& but adds a real depth of extra gameplay options.The only slight criticism I have& echoed in one of the previous reviews& is that the pieces aren't quite as robust and precisely made as they could be& there are occasions when the beam can become slightly off centre which means that it may not take the correct course at longer ranges.HOWEVER - With a bit of care& you can combat this - Take a few moments |testing| each piece at a distance from the beam& if you carefully press the mirrors one way or the other you can seem to |settle| them and align them better. If you do find that the beam is slightly out of line during a game& and can't settle the mirrors& try swapping the piece that seems to be affecting the beam's trajectory with another of the same pieces on the board.Read more â€º"
14246,4410,4," The concept of Khet is a brilliant strategy game uising lasers. You really need to know your angles of reflection to enjoy this. The fact that there are add on features to the basic pack (which is great in itself) incluing the extra Pillar make this an enduring masterpiece. It is fun and very easy to understand and pick up& may take a while to master and no two games should be the same.However& sadly it is rather let down by the quality of its manufacture. When using mirrors to reflect a beam of light around a board (some pieces even split the light for more fun)"
14247,4410,3," The concept of this game is great and is educational too. ...I have enjoyed playing it but the quality of the manufacture lets its donw in my case.The mirror angles are out on some pyramids meaning you have wayward lasers.The laser piece has a loose top whch means it satys on unless you fiddle with it to stay off.All in all I am disappointed with this purely becuas eof the quality of manufacture."
14248,4410,1," This game sounds like fun.  Unfortunately& I never got to find out.  I have had to return this twice because of defaults.In both cases the Sphinx laser projector/pointer did not function correctly.  First time around& the red sphinx's laser was really dull& and the silver one only worked intermittently.  I returned the first one and asked for a replacement.  This time the silver sphinx's laser did not function at all.  I will be avoiding this game now& as I am not convinced of the build quality.These were the last two that amazon had remaining in stock& and both were faulty.  Having now returned both& I notice that amazon's stock has gone up by two.  Coincidence?Without functioning lasers this game is point(er)less!"
14249,4410,4," The fact I've given this game 4 stars despite the weak manufacturing is a testament to how much fun it is - mentally taxing like chess - but more accessible and& let's face it& much cooler.Unfortunately& the good news ends there. Only buy Khet 2.0 if you can take inevitable design flaws in your stride and still enjoy the good game that lies underneath. As other reviews have mentioned& the lasers do not reflect correctly at larger distances. Manufacturing for light reflection needs to be perfect - and it is not.Each piece should be at an exact 45 degree angle in order to reflect the light 90 degrees. It is probably true to say that the errors on each piece are fractional"
14250,4411,5," As seen in Star Trek Generations this Enterprise sports the damage it sustained during it's encounter with an energy ribbon while responding to a distress call from a transport ship trapped in the ribbon.  It was the ship's maiden voyage but it was missing several positions& parts and equipment& it had no medical staff& no tractor beam and no photon torpedoes. This was the last time former Captain James T. Kirk (now retired) was to be on Starship.  After enabling the Enterprise to escape the ribbon (after it completed it's rescue it became tapped itself) the deck where Kirk was suffered a hull breach and Kirk was swept out into the ribbon."
14251,4411,5," A brilliantly detailed model. The mold is better than the excelsior (esp the nacelles)."
14252,4412,5," Note: This particular toy is not suitable for pre-school children due to very small parts. The recommended age range is 4-10.Playmobil have been established as a 'miniature world' toy for just over 40 years now& with their pre-school toys being noted for play value and durability. The range has expanded over the years and now incorporates knights& pirates and princesses as well as the more realistic toys reflecting real life& first launched in the Seventies. This car service workshop and Porsche car playset is part of the Playmobil real life 'City Action' range which incorporates a wide range of vehicles designed to appeal to the primary school child. Playmobil do separate their toys by gender& and these toys are marked as being for boys on their website. (This has been played with by girls at my house and they loved it.)The car:  A scale model Playmobil 3911 Porsche 911 Carrera S. You have  the main body of the car itself& to which spoilers& wheels& wings& decals and a battery powered power unit are then fitted.  The spoilers and red wheel trims are optional fittings.The rest of the playset: There is a Porsche branded car service workshop reception desk set with display walls for spare accessories can be fitted to the car& a potted plant (very fiddly to assemble!) a car jack& tools& a service mechanic and a driver (the roof of the Porsche lifts off for the driver to fit in the car). The parts are separately bagged to aid with sorting pre-construction.  I really liked the fact that the spoilers and wheel trims clipped in to place on the reception desk walls& to prevent them from being lost.Needed for assembly: 3 AAA batteries& small screwdriver& coin or similar to turn slotted disc holding battery pack in place.Read more â€º"
14253,4412,5," This set is fantastic and the attention to detail playmobil has put into it is fantastic. It's a perfect replica of a Porsche 911 carrera S but with a whole mechanics workshop and customisation options that will keep your youngster busy for ages. It's badged as 4 plus which I think is about right. The set has 51 pieces in all& although the car is fully assembled except for the battery pack and optional spoiler& hood and trim. My nephew loved it!"
14254,4412,5," This Playmobil Porsche and workshop set certainly is an eye catcher.  My son loved the Playmobil Police Cruiser so I couldn't wait to see his face with this.It was certainly a hit and is now subject to be chased by the Police cruiser quite regularly.It's a well specced kit and you get the car& the workshop and some accessories.  A lot of the stuff is quite small and the recommended age is 4+.The car requires some assembly with the wheels& decals etc but it was straightforward.  I really liked the way the headlights& dash and brakes all light up whcih is more than the Playmobil police cruiser.Additionally there's the service desk to complete the set with many accessories all separately bagged.  Oerall a superb kit and my boy loves it."
14255,4412,5," This is a classy bit of kit.  Very real to life in terms of scale& it looks authentic (will appeal to the grown ups too!).  It is a toy which requires some setting up which is very much part of the appeal and fun - my children (5 and 3) loved applying the stickers and the wheels.  There are small parts so not one for very small children.  Overall& it seems pretty robust although the wing mirrors seem as if they could be first victims of 2 |enthusiastic| children.The boys love the fact that the showroom has spare parts for the car and that several parts of the car are removable.  And wow - it has lights!  All in all& a fantastic toy and not bad value considering the quality."
14256,4412,5," My daughter (7) absolutely loved this. Normally she plays either with dolls& princesses& My Little Pony or Shopkins but she really enjoyed this. She's never had Playmobil before and she was genuinely quite taken with the car. She liked the working headlights& the showroom and even the tiny toy laptop that comes with it.I was impressed at the quality of the construction and the detailing that went into the car and the accessories that came with it. It is solidly built and looks really good considering it's just a toy. The modelling of the car really does Porsche credit. Unfortunately Playmobil isn't cheap but if your child has the Playmobil bug this is an excellent addition"
14257,4412,5," Great Playmobil car& my son saw this and thought it looked great and decided this is what he wanted to get with his birthday money. Arrived yesterday and he is over the moon with it. Good attention to detail and the light up function is rather cool!"
14258,4413,5," christmas present sorted"
14259,4414,3," My boy broke the pull back and the wheel  cover came off. Not a great toy for a child. More a desk ornament if you like that kind of thing. Also smaller than the rest of the toys."
14260,4414,5," It was perfect for my 3year old grandson& he loved it.It is well priced and well made. I would reccomend."
14261,4415,5," We've tried this predominantly metal potato ridge hiller successfully with a couple of Britain's tractors plus a Siku Fent 930. It's well detailed and looks like it should last& so a good addition to the junior farmyard."
14262,4415,4," xmas gift& but looks good"
14263,4416,4," Ordered this for christmas& didnt realise the actual size of the tractor..... It was tiny."
14264,4416,5," Grandson loves it....with the big bales!"
14265,4416,5," Very pleased grandson loved it"
14266,4417,5," Great product& great price and speedy delivery.  Definitely recommend this seller."
14267,4417,5," Enjoyed by recipient.  Mystery shopkin was a special one."
14268,4418,4," These Hotwheels cars are really well-made and certainly perform better than the lower cost copies available on-line. My only criticism is that they don't resist being trodden on particularly well& so once an axle is bent the car is virtually useless."
14269,4418,4," I was a little disappointed with this item as I really thought they were the bigger hot wheel cars& but& the ones that arrived were ok but not for the hot wheel track that we have"
14270,4419,4," Once built the kids loved this castle&  it was a Christmas present for my 4 year old daughter who loves it and plays with it all the time.  My 8 year old son plays with it too.  It is hard to build took us over a week doing it in stages& comes in hundreds of pieces.  I was surprised with how little furniture came with it you need to buy all the rooms separately&  you need to buy the bathroom& the dining room& the baby bedroom and the dressing room otherwise there is nothing much in it to play with.  Once all bought and built it is really good!"
14271,4419,5," My granddaughter has the castle and  she and her friends play with this for hours on end - so a great success."
14272,4419,5," Bought as a Christmas present to go with the castle& great attention to detail with the included accessories.  Minimal assembly."
14273,4419,5," Goes well with the playmobil castle bought for my 6 year old daughters birthday with great detail. Would highly recommend."
14274,4419,5," Quality was as expected - good playmobil toy."
14275,4420,5," My 4 1/2 year old was beside herself with excitement upon finding this Christmas morning! Very simple to put together& done in less than 45 mins. Love the added extras that clip onto the sink- the fish tank being a favourite. My daughter was also very excited at the fact you can pop mummy or daddies iPhone or iPod in and it transforms into barbies television. This is very big and obviously expensive but totally worth it for the smiles and hours of fun- my daughter has played with nothing else since Christmas Day! Only negative is that the box is not a plan box and is plastered in Barbie! I had a lovely courier who knocked first to advise me on this- ended up storing in the car. Don't have delivered when the recipient is home!"
14276,4420,5," Lovely Barbie house bigger than I thought& I still think it's very expensive but my daughter adores it. Quite sturdy compared to some other Barbie houses. Al in all a great buy for little girls."
14277,4420,5," My 7 year old loved getting this for Christmas! I must admit when I opened the box and saw all of the pieces I was less thrilled& but actually it looked a lot worse than it actually was. The instructions are simple enough and it all clips together with ease. It is quite sturdy and robust. I have explained to be very careful with the lift and garage door so hopefully these wont break. The sounds from the toilet/fan etc are an extra delight which she loved. A real must for any Barbie fan. Wish I could've had one when I was young!"
14278,4420,4," Bought as a Christmas present for our almost 6 year old daughter. Considering the size it actually went together fairly easily and pretty quickly - took my husband and I about 30 minutes in total. Lots of little accessories come with this house and my daughter loves it! The only negative is that it is advertised as having lots of real life sounds when in fact there is one battery operated unit that if you change the top from a sink& a bbq& fish tank will make those noises. For over Â£200 I would have expected a little more"
14279,4420,5," My daughter absolutely loves her Barbie dream house and is playing with it constantly. It arrived promptly and was relatively straight forward to construct. Instructions were clear and simple to follow. Great value for money as she hasn't stopped playing with it since receiving it on Christmas Day."
14280,4420,1," Lift is bent so very difficult to move up and down and gets stuck and as a Xmas present had to give it with a lift not able to work properly& I got some money back but still have a broken lift on daughters present."
14281,4420,4," Great item although I think the way it is delivered unpackaged is awful it should be covered so tea leafs dont get there hands on it! Box looks a bit battered so I hope it is all in one piece. luckily my daughter was at school when it was delivered or she would have seen it."
14282,4420,2," My daughter loves the house but when it arrived the cooker handle was broken and the lift plays up and sometimes doesn't work"
14283,4421,5," My little 4 year old loves Hana's Helpline& this is probably a short fad he is going through but he has insisted that this is what he wanted for Christmas.Now I have a confession to make& I really like the program as well& and having seen them multiple times I still like them. Great stories.The figures are a good representation of the characters.If you like Hana then I will say this is good value. They can now join Fireman Sam and Lunar Jim."
14284,4421,5," My grandson loves this gorgeous little characters from the television series. they are really lovely and ideal as a birthday gift."
14285,4422,5," Another excellent addition to my daughter's collection. I like the different colours in this series - not everything has to be pink all the time."
14286,4422,4," Beautiful set. Not so many peaces with this set& but it's good quality."
14287,4423,5," The toy was exactly as it was in the picture and I used the charecters as toppers for my daughters birthday cake. The only thing i was gutted about was that i paid double on here for them than in the disney shop. So do ya research not like me lol! But overall they were brill and would def buy more in the future."
14288,4423,3," The figures are not the same quality or in the same packaging as the ones in the picture. It is not the Disney shop set but a cheaper version. Will use them on top of my daughters birthday cake but disappointed in the quality. Haven't returned them as they are hard to get hold of outside of America!"
14289,4423,3," I thought this was really cheap looking when i got it& The figures is really small& I heard u can buy it for 10pounds in the Disney store aswell."
14290,4423,2," It wasn't quite what I expected& quality of figures ie faces not very good detail"
14291,4424,4," Daughter loves it. Easy enough to assemble& although I didn't do it. Apart from Rapunzel's hair& doesn't |do| anything& all imagine play. Couldn't get the app to work with it. Good sturdy product."
14292,4424,5," Daughter saved to buy this and is thrilled with it. Easy to put together. Lots of little pieces to help create great princess stories. Would maybe be improved if they added sounds or effects to it& but overall I think this is a great princess castle."
14293,4424,1," When it arrived it had a tear in the plastic& stickers were appealing off& mirror stuck on incorrectly and had black marks! I would suggest to by the wooden one from Kidcraft!"
14294,4424,5," My daughter loves this castle she's had it 18 months and ive still great the hair part has bow broke but otherwise it's still fab"
14295,4424,5," My daughter loves this castle. I love all the little extras you get with it....The furniture is gorgeous. Great price! :)"
14296,4424,5," This is a lovely castle we bought for our daughters 6th birthday! She loves it."
14297,4424,5," GORGEOUS. LOVE THIS. IT WILL HOLD ALL DISNEY PRINCESS DOLLS."
14298,4424,5," Little bit awkward to assemble because instructions were not very clear but once together a fantastic castle which my 4 year old absolutely loves!!!"
14299,4425,5," We bought our daughter the princess playmobil castle for her birthday and family members then gave her the various rooms and accessories.  She and her 9 year old sister loved to play with it for hours at a time. Would definitely recommend it."
14300,4425,5," My 4yr old loves this. It mixes quite well with her other Playmobil toys. There are quite a lot of tiny items with this"
14301,4425,5," Christmas gift for grand daughter. The only negative was the time it took on Christmas morning to assemble before she could play with it. If I had known about that I would have assembled it beforehand"
14302,4425,5," Lovely set. Bought for my 5-year-old daughter. She uses the Royal Playmobil sets for her wooden castle as they fit perfectly. The banquet room has lots of pieces& perfect for a Royal dining room."
14303,4425,5," Bethan enjoys Playmobil a lot so this was an ideal gift for a very imaginative little girl.Playmobil was loved by her mum when she was small so the legacy continues!"
14304,4425,5," The attention to detail is fantastic and I'm sure my granddaughter will love playing with it  It is all I hoped it would be from a Playmobil set."
14305,4425,5," High detailed figures and props. You have to apply a few stickers with great accuracy. Kept the kids busy for a couple of hours."
14306,4425,5," Fabulous set with gold edging detail on the plates.  I wanted to keep it for myself."
14307,4426,4," GREAT AS ALWAYS YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH POLLY POCKET BRIGHT CREATIVE PLAY LOVE THA THIS GOES ON THE WALL FOR SMALL ROOMS ITS A MUST - AND NO PICKING UP AND PUTTING AWAY"
14308,4426,5," Great product no bits on the floor& we added this to others we have bought our daughter who loves them will be buying more."
14309,4426,4," another good little extra  to add to the mall!"
14310,4426,5," I recommend it"
14311,4427,5," It came quickly and the kids live playing with it"
14312,4427,5," Better than my kitchen-very well designed"
14313,4428,4," Got this for my eight year old daughter and the sale price of Â£10.  It is a good toy but not worth the Â£25 non-sale price.  She loves it but it would be great if it came with the two smaller sisters too."
14314,4428,5," My friend's daughter loves playing with this in her bath& but the mother is not so pleased as Ellie is now on a i-want-more Barbies consumer frenzy!"
14315,4428,4," My daughter asked Santa for a Barbie cruise ship a week before Christmas!  As Santa would have already finished all his main shopping by then& she was very lucky that he managed to get this last minute and she was delighted! She calls it a speed boat and it is a regular bathtime toy!  The ring at the back in which one ot the sisters can ride is attached by a flimsy connection which has alread come loose so is no longer being used (only 4 weeks after Christmas& hence no 5 star review).  The seat |belts| pop out so are easy to put on the dolls before they sit on.  Having Stacey on board was a bonus as she was the only sister missing from her collection."
14316,4428,5," My 3 year old granddaughter is just starting to play with Barbie dolls& and of course she wants everything Barbie-related 'all at once'."
14317,4428,5," Fantastic price& excellent value for money. Doll and boat well made. My 9 year old daughter loves playing with it."
14318,4428,5," I bought this for a 7 year olds birthday present. Great buy& good quality and bigger than i was expecting."
14319,4428,5," this is amazing and I recommend this product to under 12s it is so cool and so much fun buy it!!!!"
14320,4429,5," Great for anyone that likes designing keeps them busy!"
14321,4429,5," Nice little gift for my 8 year old"
14322,4430,5," my 5 and half year old just loves this. The little detailed items are fairly easy for a child with good manual dexterity! Fits into most standard size dolls houses too so no need to buy the whole house."
14323,4430,5," My granddaughter has the castle and her friends play with her for hours with this set so it has been a great success."
14324,4430,5," very cute for 6 yrs old girl.. great detail and goes really well...  would recommend.  my daughter just loves this."
14325,4430,5," This again part of birthday present and it was great and our granddaughter delighted - everything bright and colourful and well made and should stands the test of time.  We still have 'wee' people of thirty five years in our home!!  Again& no hesitation in recommending this furniture for mansion&"
14326,4430,5," I bought this for my 3 and 5 year old to use with the Secret Play Box Castle.  We are able to store this furniture inside the castle when it is folded.  They really love having the baby with the cradle."
14327,4430,5," This has some great detail and goes really well with the playmobil castle my 6 year old had for her birthday. Would recommend"
14328,4430,2," I consider it poor value for money it looked cheap and nasty but my Granddaughter wanted it to complete the set she has"
14329,4430,4," Full of potential for imaginary play adds to the playmobil princess castle she already has. She loves playing with it!"
14330,4431,4," Really cute but a little boring. Once my 9 yr old daughter had played with it for a bit& it's now sitting on the side. Maybe better for younger kids?"
14331,4432,5," Bought this for my 17 year old who has never grown out of her playmobil!! She has just joined the gym for medical reasons and thought this was brilliant - particularly the interchangeable ponytail."
14332,4432,5," Excellent toy for our granddaughter. Exactly as described. Delivery prompt and well packaged"
14333,4432,5," thanks"
14334,4433,5," Excellent value and quality.  Fab birthday present as it is full of play potential and easy to put together with endless play when complete. Highly recommended& but be warned& my daughter has a playmobil addiction now!"
14335,4433,5," My daughter (4) and my son (7) love playing with this. They think that it's great you can pack it away in a case and carry it around. It comes with a till which opens& cake stand which opens& signs& cups& cakes& 2 people& a few other extra little bits and my kids favourite - 3 little doughnuts. It comes with some stickers for the sign and till/counter. It seems really well made. Lots of fun had by the kids."
14336,4433,3," A gift so I do not know what the contents is like. Box a little smaller than I had thought and wish it contained more pieces for money& but I instantly fell in love with the concept of playmobil when I visited a playmobil shop in Germany and couldn't wait to buy my little cousin this. When my own daughter is old enough I will be buying her playmobil too. However& I will be buying her more of the bigger sets like the dolls house and the hotel& the detail and possibilities are fantastic with these toys. You can build a complete city and more. If I get a spare room I might contruct a city in there for her& she will never be bored then. I might join her too in the fun of running an entire city& wish I had toys like this when I were young I would be in my elements!"
14337,4433,5," I think the little girl I bought this for will love it."
14338,4433,5," Great toy& well made."
14339,4434,5," My daughter went bonkers for this Sofia set& loves all things princess. Good& safe jewellery set.Arrived extremely late though& ordered product on dec 15 and didn't arrive till jan 3. I would put it down to being busy at Christmas but I ordered some things after this product that arrived on time."
14340,4434,3," Thought it was rather expensive for the quality& tacky pictures glued onto cheap plastic. However my granddaughter seemedto like it.  Wouldn't buyagain."
14341,4434,5," Appears a bit smaller than I expected but LO is over the moon& so i'm happy."
14342,4435,5," Little ones gone love pthis"
14343,4436,5," Lovely"
14344,4437,4," Cute but extremely small - I know that sounds stupid because it is called 'the littlest pet shop' but it really is tiny (about the size of Moshlings)"
14345,4438,5," I love this doll so much! Her face& hair"
14346,4439,5," Myself and my brother bought this for my mum as a birthday present because she mentioned how she had one as a young child. We found the cutest one after looking at a lot of creepy ones and she loved it. It is cute and it's a great gift."
14347,4439,5," My grandson was thrilled to bits& as this was for school."
14348,4439,5," Very pleased:-)"
14349,4440,4," Lovely handmade product. Bought as a special gift for my daughters teacher and ta. A bit on the expensive side but didn't mind paying as they are fair trade products. The only gripe was that they don't leave you enough room to write the teachers name on the tag. Plenty of room for your child's name though. Delivered by specified date and details about fair trade on the other side of the gift tag."
14350,4440,5," Very cute& very well made.I bought as a gift for a lovely lady who looks after my Daughter at playschool. She was very touched"
14351,4440,5," This fairy is very cute but can easily be broken so isnt ment for young kids..ive bought two to say thankyou to my childs teacher at the end of term."
14352,4440,5," This is a lovely beautiful fairy a bit expensive but my daughter's pre-school teacher loved it so it wasworth every penny"
14353,4440,5," Amazing really special gifts. My daughter was so pleased and excited to give them to her teacher. Thank you so mych"
14354,4440,5," Beautiful& unusual gift. Bought them to give to my sons nursery teachers and I'm sure they will love them"
14355,4440,4," Nice idea for a thankyou present&a littlr bit expensive for what they are but very sweet"
14356,4440,3," Its okay&and for a good cause.Not stunning though and very tiny for the cost"
14357,4441,5," Lovely rag doll& very well made."
14358,4442,5," My kids (6 and 4 yrs old) love them!  They are easy to undress and dress. I love the bright colors."

14363,4445,5," Gorgeous & excellent quality &my little niece was thrilled with this and I loved buying her a childhood favourite 80's toy"
14364,4445,5," So cute. This is for granddaughter Christmas& our children had and loved the originals in the 80's"
14365,4445,5," She loved it .It came in time and with no problem."

14368,4446,5," My children like playing with the Plan Toys Terrace house"
14369,4447,5," Very pretty cool for a small child& as are all Powell products"
14370,4447,5," Lovey"
14371,4448,4," Gave this to my two year old flower girl to play with in the church& sat it on her pew so that she found it when she sat down after walking up the aisle ahead of me. Kept her quiet! The white dress wasn't so white after she 'fed' it at the wedding breakfast& but that didn't seem to bother her. I don't know how it washed I'm afraid& I haven't asked her mum& but I heard she plays with it regularly and the wedding was 6 months ago so it must be lasting ok."
14372,4448,5," Was the perfect gift for my young bridesmaids& they loved them!  The loosely tied ribbons meant we could change them to a colour of our choice."
14373,4448,5," Purchased 2 of these dolls for our 3yr old flower girls. Just what we wanted& just the right size for them.Haven't been played with yet so cannot comment on durability."
14374,4448,5," I ordered this doll as a surprise for the 3-year old Flower Girl who will be at my son's wedding in May.  I'm going to put a sash on the doll of the same colour as the child is wearing - and hope it will distract her from destroying her bouquet during the wedding service."
14375,4448,5," these dolls were very nice my grandaughters carried them at their mum and dads weddinglooked really good and kept them happy"
14376,4448,5," I bought four of these adorable rag dolls for our flower girls and they loved them. They are good quality and very cute."
14377,4449,5," Beautiful gift for flower girls& small bridesmaids & excellent quality and efficient service"
14378,4449,5," My daughter love this doll and is very well made I bought it for her for my wedding as a nice little gift for her on the table to play with."
14379,4450,5," Bought for Xmas for granddaughter& she really loves this type of doll to play with.arrived well in time for Xmas"

14381,4450,5," My daughter loved it! Made a really great surprise for her birthday! Even I loved it because it's so cute!"
14382,4450,5," Excellent product speedy delivery."
14383,4450,2," the toy is realy nice. but the packaging was torn on the bottom and it looked like it had been opened before."
14384,4451,5," bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas last year and it was a good present& she enjoyed it and still uses it a year on"
14385,4451,5," Item arrived safely and on time. I am delighted."
14386,4452,5," Brought this Elsa doll for my 3 year old grand daughter for Christmas. Lovely doll well made I can't wait to see her face when she opens it. I tried to get her one for her birthday but unfortunately couldn't get one anywhere so pleased when I saw it on Amazon. Fast delivery. Packaging very good. Definitely recommend."
14387,4452,5," Grand daughter loved this ..only downside is the batteries cannot be replaced but giving great pleasure"
14388,4452,4," Amazing doll the only 1 negative point is that you can't replace the batteries but overall lovely"
14389,4452,5," Great doll wee girl loves it never done listening to let it go"
14390,4453,5," This Kid is for one of my granddaughters and reflects her colouring.  Lovely doll which I hope will give a few years' pleasure when it is given as a present for Xmas.  Excellent service."
14391,4453,5," I bought this for my grand-daughter's birthday and she was absolutely thrilled."
14392,4453,5," She`s gorgeous. Spitting image of my grandaughter. She will be a much loved doll to keep forever. Very quick delivery too."
14393,4453,5," My granddaughter absolutely loves this doll and it was a great price& beating all other outlets."
14394,4453,5," lovely doll with light up shoes& good price& well packaged and delivery on time"
14395,4453,5," Every girl - no matter what age! Should have one!"
14396,4454,5," Gorgeous rag doll for my flower girl. Arrived very quickly and beautifully made. Highly recommended"
14397,4455,5," Very strange things but has hit something with my daughter's age group for sure! Wasn't sure about buying any of these dolls as all seemed a bit of a rip off. Not quite like barbie where you can buy a ton of clothes in addition& which is why I chose this doll which comes with 3 outfits so a good starter piece without having to spend oodles on a load of other bits and pieces. My daughter absolutely loves it! And Frankie Stein is now best friends with Barbie!"
14398,4456,5," Great for fans"
14399,4457,5," My granddaughter loves all her doll's house people and furniture and this is a great addition to it.  It will be good for lots of pretend play."
14400,4457,5," Looks good quality Christmas present so time will tell."
14401,4458,5," Really pleased with this excellent tin-box toy. It's vibrant colours& loud musical chimes& and well made clown make for a very enjoyable childs toy. Not sure quite how robust it will be& but for the price& its a very reasonable purchase& and looks and play's great."
14402,4458,3," Got this for my little boy who was fascinated with a |Jack in the Box| - it's ok but it's very hard for him to push the clown back in and get it to stay in on his own so he gets very frustrated."
14403,4458,5," being the traditional metal jack in the box this toy brought back memories of my own childhood.  my grandson loves it and he giggles and giggles when the jack pops up.......a great toy"
14404,4458,5," This was a Christmas present for my great-granddaughter at the request from her mother for a traditional Jack in the box. I think both were delighted with it."
14405,4458,5," Bought for my daughters first birthday and she absolutely loves it. Such a good idea to buy at a good price :))))"
14406,4459,4," Was exactly what I wanted but would rather have paid the standard Disney Store price if they had ever had Elsa in stock. Much  nicer and closer to the film character than the Tesco/Argos version. I think my daughter will be happy on Christmas Day."
14407,4459,5," Love this. All the Animator Dolls are perfect."
14408,4459,5," Granddaughter loves it"
14409,4459,5," Great"
14410,4460,4," My 4 year old son is very pleased with his birthday present.  He wanted Woody to play with his bubble bath Buzz so they went in the bath together!!!  His Dad took out his batteries and dried all by heater and Woody still works fine so it is quite well made.  Little bit pricey but you obviously get what you pay for."
14411,4460,5," I bought this Woody direct from the Disney Store for Â£25 plus postage. This Woody is the correct size (i.e. as in the Films) and is excellent quality. He has all the best sayings like |There's a snake in my boot!| and has in infectious laugh. Yes he is not as functionally rich as the Woody from the Toy Story Collection (my eldest son's Christmas present)& but I think he is a close second and is brilliant nonetheless. Certainly better than the Toy Story 3 Woody that is currently for sale!"
14412,4460,4," This is a great Woody doll. We have only had it a few days but it seems well-made& and stands being thrown around by a two-year-old well so far. It has a good variety of spoken phrases& including all the famous ones& which was what we expected."
14413,4460,5," Excellent quality and great resemblence to the movie character Woody. My 4-year old loves him and brings him everywhere! :-)"
14414,4460,5," I bought this 2 years ago for my granddaughters Christmas present& she kept asking for it she is now 8 and still loves it"
14415,4460,4," A great toy& pull string works fine at the moment and his voice is similar to Tom hanks. The finish on the doll isn't great& his arms are quite stiff and the stitching isn't great in some places. Also his hat pops off really easy. However my daughter loves him and that's all that matters. All in all very pleased. I will just add he takes a long time to arrive!"
14416,4460,4," This is great but very different to my nephews doll which is a year old..the buttons for example aren't pearly in colour"
14417,4460,4," My daughter loves this toy and even though it says a large number of phrases& I personally don't think the voice sounds like Tom Hanks. However& she carries it everywhere and giggles everytime she pulls his string. Worth buying for a Toy Story fan. Very prompt delivery"
14418,4461,5," I bought this to replace the identical one that my mother lost in a house fire when she was a child. I was worried it wouldn't be the same quality as it used to be& but my mum broke down crying with happiness at how similar they are. The doll itself is very soft and squishy and feels well made."
14419,4462,5," I have bought 4 of these Pokemon figures so far from Takara Tomy for my Stepson and they are perfect! They come in a plastic blister packaging and all writing is in Japanese but they truly are the best figures I have come across in terms of likeness to the cartoon characters. I will certainly be buying more of these!"
14420,4462,5," Very pleased with the product would definitely recommend"
14421,4462,5," He arrived today& love him ^..^Came well before the estimated delivery date too& true to the picture too =]Thankoo x"
14422,4462,4," Great little Pokeman unfortunately I was sent 3 the same instead of different ones"
14423,4462,5," Arrived before it was due.  Well packaged and exactly as described.  Would use again."
14424,4462,5," For any pokemon lovers should get it"
14425,4463,5," Been looking for this minnie mouse toy for ages& its fab!! well packaged and quick delivery& very happy."
14426,4464,4," Cute"
14427,4465,5," A pretty rag doll& quite appealing"
14428,4466,5," Lovely& well made doll. My 18 month old son loves him."
14429,4466,5," Very cute and looks well made - just what I wanted for my young grandson! Looking forward to seeing him play with it at Christmas."
14430,4466,5," Smashing doll so much better than I thought it would be. Very well made granddaughter adores it. Thank you ."
14431,4466,4," Arrived very quickly& looks great. A little bit more stuffing in the legs would be good."
14432,4466,5," Fantastic present and very fast delivery"
14433,4467,4," ordered this item for my daughter for christmas. it was delivered within a quick time and was well packaged. my daughter loves it its easy to use and washes well although after only 1 wash a tiny hole has appeared in the hand."
14434,4467,5," great toycolour it all in& then wash it and start againthe pens dont stain either so if it goes on your clothes& washes straight outI have bought for a few little girls"
14435,4468,5," Excellent quality well worth every penny"
14436,4469,4," It is small but really well made&  would have been nicer if a little more robust or filled& the recipient was really happy with it though& 3 year old niece loves her dolly's& the dress and colour's are pretty and would make a nice addition to any little girl's collection."
14437,4469,5," well i got this for a friend so she could give it as a christmas present.but she told me it is a really good doll and she would buy more if she needed any more"
14438,4469,5," Beautifully made dolls.  Ifell in love straight away.  I want to sent one to Africa and it's light enough for the post.  They are just gorgegous."
14439,4469,4," this was very pretty and was suitable for a little girl.the delivery was excellent.I really loved this doll it was bright and colourful."
14440,4469,5," Very pretty and looks well made - just what I wanted for my small granddaughter. Look forward to seeing her play with it at Christmas."
14441,4469,5," My little girl loves her rag doll |lolly|Great quality and just the right size to be carried around under little arms."
14442,4469,5," This was the second doll I bought and I am again not disappointed . They are beautifully made and the children love them"
14443,4469,5," Parcel arrived and really pleased with the doll. It is pretty and well made and a nice size. It has a lovely face too."
14444,4470,5," I saw these on Pinterest and i thought that they wouldn't be available in the UK (all the coolest stuff is always only in the USA) but i was so happy to discover they were there! I bought two for some good friends who will greatly appreciate them. Everyone should have a dammit doll in their lives!"
14445,4471,5," This made my niece& age 3& so very happy. I love an age appropriate doll!"
14446,4471,5," Beautiful doll& arrived on time."
14447,4472,5," Very pleased and will probably order another& thank you!"
14448,4473,4," The doll is really beautiful and of high standard& but it doesn't go in a gift box& but in a plastic bag. I was a bit disappointed because it was supposed to be a gift& but well& the doll is really nice."
14449,4473,5,""
14450,4473,4," my doll came on time it was what the product said and for me to the child i was giving it to it was perfect would have liked it to have been in a box or presented better but i assume costs are involved.I would shop here again"
14451,4473,4," This soft toy was bought for my granddaughters 1st birthday.  Apparently she carries around with her all the time.  She must love it."
14452,4474,5," What can I say? We got this for our granddaughter she was over the moon with it it arrived in the time stated and was just as described. We had hunted the shops for one and was unsuccessful so turned to amazon who didn't fail& should of done amazon first. Would buy from them again"
14453,4474,4," I bought this for my daughter who loves cuddly toys especially cute ones. I was received within 3 days."
14454,4474,5," A must have for any 'big eyes' collector. I bought this for my daughters whose collection has taken over my house lol. They loved it. Highly recommend!"
14455,4474,5," Cute& soft& good quality.  Arrived on time.  Bigger than expected.  Very nice.  Child recipient was very happy.  What more can I say"
14456,4475,5," cute as can be--gift was liked !!"
14457,4476,4," My daughter bought this doll to add to her ever growing collection of Groovy Girls.  She loves it and is the bride to her boy doll.  Hours of fun with them and her imagination is growing by the day."
14458,4476,5," My 5 year old daughter was after a Disney princess doll& but they all have such awful faces and look too grown up& so I was delighted to find this one. I was a little worried& but she loves it.Regarding fun score - it's what your child's imagination is like as to whether it is fun or not and not really the product."
14459,4476,5," Fantastic old fashion rag doll in a lovely outfit. My two year old daughter loves this doll. Consider buying more of the groovy girls:-)"
14460,4476,4," This has been purchased as a gift for my 3 yo niece. Admittedly it is smaller than I was expecting and parts of it look slightly cheap - but the face is cute and the toy is just the right size to be carried around by a little girl."
14461,4477,4," I've bought a handful of Dammit Dolls after reading an article in The Daily Telegraph& in which Royal Shakespeare Company Artistic Director& Greg Doran& revealed that he had been given a doll by one of his colleagues when he was given the job. It's a fun item and yes& I guess that you use any kind of soft toy& but the Dammit Dolls seem particularly well suited for some physical abuse - the stuffing is fairly firm and won't come out and I like the resigned (not to say& dead-eyed) expression on its face. I'm going to give this model - Le Tout Savoir ('The Know It All') to my friend& Thomas& whom& I am sure& will enjoy beating the hell out of it."
14462,4478,5," Beautifully made and funkily clothed& Harper perfectly illustrates the myriad charms of Lily Dolls and reminds me once again how cross I am that Manhattan Toys discontinued this splendid line."
14463,4479,5," My daughter loves these dolls. Just what we expected :-)"
14464,4479,4," Small but nice doll for the money."
14465,4480,3," Looks as in picture but really quite small& and not really large enough to be a proper rag doll which are normally quite floppy!"
14466,4480,5," I like this little doll. She was purchased to adorn the top of a Christmas tree dedicated to cancer nurses and she looked exactly right for the job& a little 'angel'& as most of our nurses are. Nicely made& really& really cute and cheap as well. Arrived nicely on time& as is usual for Amazon and their approved outlets."
14467,4480,5," Would recommend this to mums who's kids get unwell alot my daughter only gets this doll when she's not well as its a nurse and I tell her that nurse polly will make her feel better soon if she gets lots of cuddles and kisses its so sweet"
14468,4480,5," Small so v good for my almost 1 and almost 2 yr olds to share and take along on outjngs"
14469,4480,5," beautifully handmade and great attention to detail from wool hair to cotton bloomers&  lovely present and nice to see rag dolls still around"
14470,4480,1," Bought this for my granddaughter who was in hospital to brighten her up& but I was really disapointed with the size& but then again I hadnt read the detail properly& not the best buy.Overall quality was OK& cute little dolly."
14471,4480,5," HOT NIGHTS? little one just can't sleep? lots of tears are washed away when nurse comfort does her rounds.This cute little doll has a 100% SUCCESS RATE SO FAR AND I WOULD SAY GET ONE WHILE YOU CAN.VIA AMAZON UK"
14472,4480,5," Small but nice my daughter likes to take it to bed with her all the time and it helps her brother to take his median with the little burse watching over him"
14473,4481,5," Well made and looks better in real life!Brought to give daughter more ethnic dolls and this looks cool& feels soft and is a lovely brown colour!"
14474,4482,5," Ideal wee stocking filler"
14475,4483,5," Gorgeous little doll! Very well made and extremely well received by my 3 year old daughter!"
14476,4484,4," I bought this little 8| tall rag doll to be a Goldilocks to the Three Bears I already had and I was delighted with her. She is very well-made and very cute for the money. There is a good attention to detail in her cotton clothes (although they are not removable) and she is even wearing a proper pair of bloomers& which do come off. Best value I could find for such a doll."
14477,4484,5," Bought for my granddaughter who is still a baby but there for when she is old enough to play with it."
14478,4484,4," I wanted a small doll for my friend's little girl. I was a bit disappointed that the stitching was badly finished off but overall there was a lot of detail and the doll has a sweet face."
14479,4485,5," I ordered this Newborn doll for my daughter because we were expecting another girl& but we received a boy doll instead.  Amazon did not allow you to enter the sex of the toy& but as a pink doll was pictured& I assumed that I was receiving a 'girl' doll.  I wrote via email to JC Toys& but did not receive an answer via communication through Amazon.co.uk& so just be aware that you might be receiving what is not featured when you order."
14480,4486,5," Loved it... cheap alternative to the John Lewis penguin!!!!!"

14486,4490,4," fine"
14487,4491,5," Lovely doll"
14488,4492,5," My daughter already has a Manhattan doll so I knew what size to expect& but would recommend you check the sizing as they are not 'large' dolls& but the quality is superb and the fact that you can remove the tail and add a skirt adds endless fun for the mermaid lover& as long as you can keep her out of the water!"
14489,4492,5," I love these doll! They are very cute and make me smile. I like their different face expressions - it make them unique I think& and also because of different hair styles and cloths. Quality is great& very durable& delivery was efficient and a package was nicely packed. Many thanks!"
14490,4492,4," Knew from past purchases that the Groovy Girl mermaids come with legs and an outfit that mean it can be played with as a doll as well as a mermaid.  My daughter likes the fact that it is similar to her sister's mermaid& but has it's own name/ colours."
14491,4492,4," My 4 year old loves this doll and the matching fancy dress I brought her ( although the costume is falling apart after just one wash& but hey thats fancy dress for you!)The only thing I dont like about it is the legs under the tail ( why she has legs I don't know& shes a mermaid) and sewn on so you cant really release the legs totally and I can predict there will be a lot of pulling and in the end a ripping!But she got this for christmas& and I think it may have been a favorite gift. A great one for a little mermaid fan."
14492,4493,5," BEAUTIFUL RAG DOLL THE HEIGHT IS 40CMS THE TUTU IS PINK& AND THE BALLERINA SHOES ALSO THE WRAP OVER TOP PINK ALSO WITH SMALL FLOWER AT WAIST& LOVELY DOLL TO KEEP FOR YOURSELF OR TO GIVE AS A GIFT - PERFECT&  SELLER& AND FAST POSTING HIGHLY RECOMMEND."

14497,4493,5," I had ordered this for my granddaughter  from another site& it took them 3 weeks to tell me they could not get it. I then ordered it from Powell Craft and it arrived in a few days& it is just what I wanted and I know my granddaughter will love it."
14498,4493,3," The doll it's self is really nice but after just a short time with my daughter gently playing with it the rose in its hair began to unravel and fall off and then the ribbon behind the bow moments after that& so I'm a bit disappointed really."
14499,4494,5," I love this. It's wonderfully detailed& looks great& and fits perfectly onto my keychain. I would reccomend this to anyone."
14500,4494,5," good for halloween"

14503,4496,5," I bought both Sebastian and Ciel from Ecstatic Arts and was very pleased with the results. They arrived quickly& and were a decent size. They are both adorable& really good quality and they even have a little loop attached to their head so you can hang then up as well. They look perfect sitting on my pillow or hanging on my wardrobe door. Only problem was Sebastian had a little bit of glue on his waistcoat but that was easily removed."
14504,4496,5," I bought this as birthday present for my partner. He loved it! It's a great gift for any fan of the anime.Good material and stitching.I did at first worry over the delivery& but it arrived well in time.Would recommend."

14516,4502,5," My little girls are developing a collection of these dollys now& one of which is over 2 years old and very well loved!!!! Has survived washing machine several times& but is losing it's fight now! These do need to be well-looked-after and treated with care& but are very beautiful& special dollys& and I am sure there isn't a little girl out there who wouldn't love one!!The seller wrapped them lovingly in tissue paper"
14517,4502,3," My little one loved this& kept her occupied at wedding n matched colour theme but overpriced for a small doll"
14518,4502,5," excelent"
14519,4503,5," Lovely rag doll by Rag Dolls - like the beany bottom so the doll sits up unaided. Brought to accompany male doll Jerome and used in adult teaching sessions to great effect."

14525,4504,5," Great while feeding her... keeps her busy in the car.... I have to put a voice on and I'm sure she knows its me but she still loves it!"
14526,4504,5," Thank you so much for the puppets. Each family member is distinguishable& with cute details like the tie on the fathers shirt and the bun in the grandmothers hair. My kids loved them straight away.. aged 2 and 4. Definitely worth the money for the effort put into them. Don't know why some are complaining!"
14527,4504,4," Great value- 6 year old absolutely loves them"

14533,4506,5," She is& as Groovy girls is& adorable. The doll is even sweeter than on the pic. Love that the Groovy Girls dolls and their stuff are not in plastic& it can be machine washed (though i don't think its recommended from Manhattan toys)& it easy to dress& and soft so it can come to bed at night. AND not least my girls love playing with them!"

14542,4509,5," I've just recently discovered the super cute game Cut The Rope and I'm not scared to admit that I've became a wee bit addicted& having installed it on both my iPad and phone!My boyfriend recognising this addiction and love of Om Nom bought me this awesome little version of him.  He's super soft and looks just like him& sometimes when game characters are transferred to plush they lose some of their |look| however I'm glad to say that Om Nom hasn't and he's sitting pride of place in my bedroom - big kid that I am!"
14543,4509,4," came in a black mailing bag which is fine as it arrived in perfect condition but was disappointed it didn't come in the box like it's pictured.  would have been a sweet little touch as it's for my son's birthday."

14548,4509,4," My daughter loves Om Nom and is very happy with this toy. I would have given it five stars if it had arrived in the box as pictured but it didn't."
14549,4510,4," My daughter now has four of the fairy dolls from the Groovy Girls collection.  We have used them as rewards for sleep challenges and she believes them to have come from the Sleep Fairies themselves!  They are really nicely designed and made and have a lot of lovely detailing on them& which does set them apart from other cloth dolls.  The only thing I don't like about them is that they are all wearing pierced ear-rings!"
14550,4511,5," My daughter's eyes lit up when she saw it. Of course& she didn't want to PUT anything in it. She sleeps with it& along with the other myriad of stuffed things."
14551,4511,3," cute and furry& but really small& I got it for a 4 year old and it's tiny! more of a small handbag than a back pack!"
14552,4511,4," My little niece will love her new backpack& she will be 2yrs old in a week."
14553,4511,5," My daughter loves it. its really cute and just the right size for a 2 year old"
14554,4511,5," Adorable& perfect for a pre-schooler& really small and cute.  I love it."
14555,4512,5," I bought this rag doll as a Christening gift for my friends daughter as I didn't want a traditional Christening gift. Her middle name is |Rose| so chose this doll with that in mind!! She arrived promptly and well packaged. And added bonus that the postage was free. I'm sure this rag doll will be loved - myown daughter has now begged me to order one for her too. She's beautifully made and will last a lifetime."
14556,4512,5," Very nice item well priced"
14557,4513,4," Very pleased with how quick the doll arrive& quality for cost good& same as in pic"
14558,4514,4," GREAT TOY I got it for my daughter because she wants to have a doll to sleep with. Quality and material was a little fail. I also got Lalaloopsy Soft Doll - Spot Splatter Splash which was better than this. One thing that is a huge failure FREAKY DETAIL I prefer the normail dolls better and Ty Beanie Boo 6| Plush -Hedgehog Spike I ALSO GOT."
14559,4515,5," A perfect little gift to send to  my grandchild in Oz&as it is lightweight& small and very attractive.Who wouldn't want one?"
14560,4515,4," bought for my baby grand daughter. very sweet and just the right size for a young baby.i would recommend this."
14561,4515,5," Nice little doll. Bought to go in Christmas shoebox to go abroad for which it is just the right size."
14562,4515,5," ok for a rag doll."
14563,4516,5," Lovely looking dolls nice quality too"
14564,4517,5," our great great niece is going to love this dolly.  She a tom boy& and this dolly is what she will love"
14565,4517,5," She is lovely and I am sure my granddaughter will agree."
14566,4517,5," love it"
14567,4517,3," The picture of the item shows the doll with a bag. Bag was not in packaging. Daughter wanted to keep."
14568,4518,5," This doll immediately became my daughter's best friend.  My wife and I are constantly being called on to bring it to life.  It has become an additional member of our family.  Our only complaint is that the arms are not that securely attached to the dolls body& and both became detatched within a month of purchase."
14569,4519,4," Bought several little Budkins to go with the red bus. Lovely detail& beautifully made and good size for little fingers. A pity they dont sit in the bus too firmly& they slide off the seats&  but my granddaughter doesn't seem to mind!"
14570,4519,3," This little old lady is a classic Budkins figure. I bought this for my daughter so she could have some passengers for the Budkins bus. She loves them."
14571,4519,5," Lovely item."
14572,4520,5," Very well made product daughter has had loads of fun just a shame that this product is had to buy as I could only find it on Amazon."
14573,4520,5," great gift"
14574,4521,3," Generally a nice doll& soft and appropriate for younger girls& but the |hair| goes out a bit and they stay in little's hand and may get in their mouth& which is not great."
14575,4521,5," So neatly made. So quite. And so lovely. Highly recommended. Xxx"
14576,4522,4," I find this little stress doll really cute& perfect for stress relieving& perfect for whacking the walls out of anger. But I didn't expect it to be big. A little smaller would've been better. I definitely recommend this to everyone who got anger issues!"
14577,4523,5," I can't believe my luck with this product. This is a really lovely rag doll and one which I feel will delight the little girl it was bought for. It is bright& well mad and is instantly liked as her face just captures an innocent moment. Certainly worth a visit if anyone wants something different for a little person forChristmas& or in fact& any other time of the year."
14578,4523,5," Just what I wanted& thanks.  She has a lovely face."
14579,4524,4," good size and looks nice enough& but I think babies usually prefer less rigid toys. Maybe for a 2 year old?"
14580,4525,4," Not a puppet"
14581,4525,5," Really happy with this little rag doll. We brought a few to encourage diversity in the home and learning about different peoples looks. My son (10 months) smiles at the dolls when I get them out for him to play with."
14582,4525,4," already had this make before for my grandaughter. they are taken everywhere with her . been washed several times and still look gd. natural choice to get same make for younger grandaughter."

14592,4528,5," Very well received Christmas gift"
14593,4528,5," All good - recommended :)"
14594,4529,4," This is a good product but it is very high. Even a friend who is above average height struggled. you will need steps to reach the faces"
14595,4529,5," This is a great OSCAR party cut out. This |Red Carpet Couple| will be a big hit at our party on Feb 28th."
14596,4529,2," colours not very bright and much too tall I am going to have to cut it down as none of my friends are 7 foot"

14604,4532,4," Bought this as a gift for my fiancÃ©e& as he has a huge walking dead pop vinyl collection. He absolutely loves it. I myself have 0 interest in zombies& but can't help find this one awesome.

14605,4532,5," Really looks like character from Walking Dead. Packed with extra padding"
14606,4532,5," Very pleased with this product!

Great attention to detail with the mud splatters on the bike. All in all very happy with this product!"

14610,4533,5," got this for my grandson apparently he is very pleased with it& i cannot give an opinion as i do not know anything about it"

14628,4540,5," Many thanks"
14629,4541,5," I did not purchase this minifigure on Amazon but it is worth reviewing& anyway it is worth getting this minifigure but not on Amazon. You are better off feeling for the armour or the helmet unless you are very desperate!"
14630,4541,5," My kids like to collect the mini figure series& sometimes they want a particular one so this is an ideal way to do it without wasting a load of money on a maybe. All the bits were there and it was well received."
14631,4541,5," FAVE LEGO MAN! I CALL HIM CLARK  BUT NOW I KNOW HES SUPER COOL...... U JUST INPIRED ME THAN YOU!!!"
14632,4541,5," No surprise& it has arrived with all the parts in the open pocket. My son was very happy with it."
14633,4542,5," We've quite a number of Funko Pop! figures kicking about the house and in my opinion this is one the better ones for capturing the character it represents. Also one of the best painted& with very little slop or missed applications& which is often a problem with these little guys (looking at you 1966 Batman)"
14634,4542,5," It this as a present for Christmas and as a massive fan of the show I was really happy& especially considering how good the product was& box was in immaculate condition and there was no harm done to outer packaging as well ðŸ˜Š"
14635,4542,5," Killed friends goldfish with its adorable eyes& other goldfish in same environment are fine so probably just a one off."
14636,4542,5," My friend loves her birthday present. Beautiful quality and came only days after purchase. Debating buying myself one."
14637,4542,5," Great pop and will make someone very happy this xmas"
14638,4542,5," brilliant figure& great for all fans of sherlock"
14639,4543,5," Thank you.my son wanted this"
14640,4544,5," I am a fan of Supernatural and thought to have Crowley vinyl for my first collection. I also have a Castiel with wings on its way from the Funko Pop site."
14641,4544,5," I am absolutely delighted with this FAB figurine!!! My Husband and myself LOVE Supernatural.....This Crowley figure sits on one of our wall shelves& along with Sam& Dean and Castiel.....Highest quality goods...very& very pleased....excellent delivery time and super packaging...I would highly recommend both this super Crowley Funko Pop figurine& and the seller to others...Thank you very much!!!"
14642,4544,5," Came exactly as expected& the box was intact. The Crowley figure has no scuff marks or mis-painting. However& the figure itself& while being able to stand up& can easily fall due to the balance of the legs and the large head& but on a stable surface this is no problem.Other than that& great figure!"
14643,4544,5," Super cute addition for anyone who loves Supernatural. Crowley is a definite cool character and Funko makes a great line of these figures to show your love of the show."
14644,4544,5," My partner loved their mini Crowly.The item itself came slightly earlier than expected& had any damage to the actual box and like I said&  my partner loved it c:"
14645,4544,5," Lovely detail& so glad to add him to my collection. Perfect paint job and packed very well."
14646,4544,5," I love this item it make me chuckle about how life like it is :)"
14647,4544,5," I am very Happy with my item and how fast delivery was"
14648,4545,5," I'm a Frozen fan (Bought Cinderella on Blu-Ray to get Frozen Fever)Anna is great& and she comes with 3 of Elsa's Sneezes (the Snowmen)I also bought a POP Elsa from Frozen Fever.(Also Merida and Rapunzel):-)"
14649,4546,5," Bought 3 years ago (I have two boys 5 and 1.5)& still as good as new& great fun for the boys& well made and durable. Educational - basic physics& rotation/winding etc& included 4 hooks sling&some loose plastic gravel and scoop with rubber clamp. Probably the best possible buy for boys (and fathers :))"
14650,4547,5," All these new Lego mini-figures seem to be bunched together& so please be aware that this review is for Frankenstein as a rocker.  With Halloween not too far away it is an ideal time to get the figures in this new series.Here we have good old Frankenstein as you have never seen him before& in denim and with a guitar.  The detailing on his clothes here is very good as you have the buttons marked out and on the back of his top there is even a â€˜Shock â€˜nâ€™ Rollâ€™ decal.  On top of this he has a chain and padlock necklace printed on.  His head and face is very well detailed as well& and includes two pieces to give him the huge forehead and thus showing off his stitching and making his eyebrows stick out a bit.Fun for children to play with this also will appeal to adults& and if you have a few figures make some decoration for Halloween and any party that you may have planned."
14651,4547,5," And so begins a new series of Lego minifigures.  And I have already been sucked in by seeing which ones I want from the set (most of them)!!Square foot is the first one from the collection& and now I am committed to collecting the rest& that's the rules according to my daughter!!!Square foot is a likeable character& and comes with a camera& already my daughter has started to use her imagination saying if he takes your picture& you'll turn into one of the beasts or monsters& of course I am now Frankenstein!!"
14652,4547,5," Great Minifigure. Comes with a code which allows you to play as Wolf Guy in Lego Minifigures Online which is a Shadow Striker Minifigure. His attacks are mellee range (he has to go up close to attack). Durability: apart from tail& which might be weaker& will be the usual for minifigures. The head does not contain one of the usual yellow heads but is a complete brick that slides reasonably securely onto the top of the body. Like all minifigures it isn't suitable for small children as the small parts would be a choking risk but it isn't difficult to put together so suitable for all children old enough to play with minifigures. If getting to play on Lego Minifigures online it will be unlocked on all characters on the same account will get it when you play as them next once you've unlocked it with the code on one. No need to buy multiples."
14653,4547,5," This is a fun minifigure from the new series 14 set released in good time for Halloween!  His big bulbous eyes are great! They are transparent red plastic. His wings are smooth smokey transparent hard plastic. Honestly have you ever seen a fly with a red lobster claw? What is that all about? The claw& the claw! Quite scarey though& imagine getting nipped with that by some strange person with a massive fly helmet.  Pull the helmet off . . . .  ARRRGH!!! . . . It's a real fly monster . . . . There is no Lego man head underneath!!!"
14654,4547,5," Purchased this for my hubby & we buy Xmas eve tree presents must be under 5.00. He's going to love bigfoot"
14655,4547,4," I purchased three of these Lego figures. the figures were as stated and were a good price too. However& as the packets were open& I was unable to give them as Christmas presents& just as 'after school' presents. Buyers should be aware of this. These figures are usually sealed and sold as 'blind bags&' but I now understand they were opened to allow customers to select the figures they wanted."
14656,4547,2," Whilst I'm a big fan of the products themselves& we purchased this set of blind bags and 2 Simpsons ones and they were all duplicates. I have enquired with Pangadgets UK about why this might be but they are yet to get back to me."
14657,4547,5," Minifigure arrived in excellent time on the very first day of delivery quoted on the website - to the delight of my Grandson& and was exactly as advertised.  Free postage had clinched the deal as far as I was concerned!"
14658,4548,5," It's a cosy little character and it reminds me of my grandfather. The only down side of it is that the newspaper always pops out of it's hand but that doesn't stop me from giving it a 5-star rating."
14659,4548,5," Grandpa goes very well with Grandma in this delightful collection.My 7 year old grand daughter will love making up stores about their lives together.Highly recommended."
14660,4548,5," I bought this for my wee lad and it's ace.  I bought the 'granny' to go with him and they're a great wee addition to his lego collection."
14661,4548,5," Looks a bit like my dad! shh don't tell him I said that."
14662,4549,5," fab."
14663,4550,5," Very nice& well painted& not too cartoony!"
14664,4551,5," Great figures to go with all the other Star Wars stuff my children have!"
14665,4551,5," according to grandson they are great !"
14666,4551,5," Perfect for all Rebels fans."
14667,4552,5," Pukka gear all the way from Japan. Awesomeness cannot be overstated. Very happy."
14668,4552,5," Arrived just in time for my cousin's birthday and he loved it!"
14669,4553,5," our child was delighted and just loves these toys.The delivery was prompt and the well packaged."
14670,4553,5," Daughter plays with this everyday she is made over peppa pig and she loves ice cream"
14671,4553,5," My 3 year old loved receiving this for Christmas. Lots of different bits to it."
14672,4553,5," Great item& my grandaughter loved it& I have a feeling we will be buying more."
14673,4553,5," granddaughter loves this and I would recommend it to anyone"
14674,4553,5," Excellent came next day& bought as a present"
14675,4553,5," bought as gift 4 year old nephew loved it"
14676,4553,5," Present for a 3 year old.  Loves it"
14677,4554,5," I bought this as a christmas present for my son who loves everything to do with dinosaurs. He also loves jurassic world especially the velossa rapptors. Hopefully he will be happy with his new claws! Very well packaged and quick delivery"
14678,4554,1," Bought these for my son& the black paint on the claws has all cracked and flaked off! Very disappointing quality especially as the toy has only been played with for one week!"
14679,4554,3," I'm siue my nephew will love them but they are literally just a couple of bits of hard plastic. Could have made better myself."
14680,4554,5," Exactly what is shown. My son is going to be so happy!! Came within 2 days aswell."
14681,4554,5," My grandson had them on all Christmas evening&so they were a great present"
14682,4555,3," I wholeheartedly regret my decision to buy this. I appreciate that the description is technically correct& but I thought that this 'pristine' collectible might be in some sort of box. I knew to expect a Lego-sized figure& but I was disappointed that it just came in a tiny plastic bag. My aim was to buy my bf one of the series for various occassions but I'm not even sure I'm going to give him this one"
14683,4555,4," Bought this for my son& going mad for anything Lego at the minute! I did however have to visit Toys R Us on Christmas Eve and discovered a small set that contained this figure for slightly less than what I paid for the one figure. If your looking for individual figures look at the sets first of all."
14684,4555,5," This was a gift for my grandson who was delighted with it.  As I was not familiar with the product I was a bit surprised at the size of the manikin"
14685,4556,5," If you have ever seen a real living fire salamander then you will really appreciate how life like this figurine is& it is spot on. This model is also true to life size& excellent!"
14686,4557,4," This toy consists of 3 |zords| which slot onto each other to form one huge character& from the Power Rangers Dino Charge series currently airing on Pop on British TV.The character is true to the programme& and is best described as a combination of a transforming toy and a constructing toy. In the toy you get the number one |dino charger|. I was confused by this& particularly having read some other reviews here which referred to it making sounds& until I realised that if you only have this set all it actually does is make various other parts of the toy pop out (not as alarming or dramatic as it sounds as eg a dinosaur acquires a crest on his head). There are NO sounds or lights - which the packaging sort of suggests. The confusion is also due to the instructions which are visual and not clear really. Once you've slotted them together and twisted once it's totally obvious how to do it - the two smaller dinosaur zords make the arms of the larger figure by clinging on with their mouths and it's all very cleverly done.The toy is well made and robust for a plastic toy. It's got great kid appeal& especially for fans of the show.At the time of writing the free app that is a selling point of it does not work (I've tried it on android and iOS)& so I can't comment on whether it makes the inclusion of the charger any more interesting. The charger does I think make sounds if you combine it with another toy in the range. And herein lies the reason it's a four and not five star toy- to get the most out of it you have to buy more from the range really and the packaging is confusing& hence possibly some inaccuracy in what people have said about it here. We've played with it a fair bit to try it out and it's not a bad toy at all& just be aware that there are no batteries or sounds involved and the app does not work"
14687,4557,5," This Power Rangers Dino Charge Deluxe Megazord combines three different dinosaur zords â€“ one large red dinosaur& plus two smaller red and pink ones â€“ into the Megazord. Like other Power Rangers toys we have had in the past& children seem to be able to take these things together and pull them apart in seconds& while I am still trying to figure them out! However& they can obviously be played with alone or together& are sturdily made and will endure a lot of Power Rangers battles without even a scratch.Also like other Power Rangers series of toys that we have had& this new Dino Charge range& can combine in many ways. This particular toy comes with one Dino Charger& which inserts into the toy to provide sound effects& etc. If you buy other toys in the range& you can also use those Dino Chargers in this toy& and vice versa& to add different sound effects. Also& you can combine different toys with the Megazord& such as the Raptor Cycles& to create a unique Zord of your own. Obviously& this adds play value and good fun.I was interested& and pleased& to see that this Megazord does have a pink dinosaur& for the pink ranger. Some previous versions of the Power Rangers toys had used purple& presumably deciding the colour was more appropriate for toys largely played with by boys"
14688,4557,5," My son loves it. He plays with it regularly and is very pleased with the toy. The quality is good& the plastic is durable and stands up to animated play.The Megazord comes with one charger (my son loves these) and breaks into three separate toys with lots of play value.Overall very pleased and highly recommend for the Power Rangers loving child."
14689,4557,5," My 5 year old boy really wanted this for Christmas and was delighted when he got it. it's well made and all the parts are detachable and interchangeable with other dino charge toys. It came in excellent condition and on time."
14690,4557,3," Bought this for my son's 6th Birthday as he is obsessed with Power Rangers. I am a bit disappointed really. As the toy needs to change from dino to robot i expected it to be a bit fiddly& however the pieces dont stay together well so arms and legs and other bits keep falling off during play so I am forever reattaching limbs. Also& we expectednthe dino charger to do more than simply slot in the holes. How does that change play? With the dino charge sword the chargers change the noises& I obviously didnt read the description closely enough but i expected something similar& or whats the point of them?Having moaned about this my son isnt too bothered about the problems& but then he hasnt paid out for it."
14691,4557,5," Grandson loves it plays with it hours and hours& I have now purchased other products that go with this item& I can't write a review as yet as the others are Christmas gifts& but will be back to let you know."
14692,4557,5," Brilliant you for any young Power Rangers fan.My 6yr old nephew was beside himself with excitement on opening this toy& being a PR fan and hugely crazy about dinosaurs!It's easy for him to take apart and transform as the pieces are all big and chunky and look like they can withstand quite rough handling and he was quickly able to transform it from the Zord into all 3 possible dinosaur configurations and back again.Great for motor skills and anticipating cause and effect with the transforming aspect of the toy& and obviously hours of enjoyment and imaginative play.An excellent you in my opinion"
14693,4558,5," Many thanks"
14694,4559,3," All of the tools supplied are very good& but unfortunately they don't all fit into the belt. It was well used by the grandson."
14695,4559,5," This was a Christmas present for my grandson who loved it. The wooden tools are of an  excellent quality"
14696,4559,5," Bought as a present for 2 year old - he started wearing/using it straight away. arrived promptly and in good packaging"
14697,4560,4," Bought this for Xmas for my nephew who is power ranger mad and be loved it! It was smaller than I thought it was going to be but he didn't seem to mind he played with it all the same!"
14698,4560,5," Bought for twin great nephews 6th birthdays with various other power ranger stuff. They seem to have come back in favour again as I remember buying all this for my son who is now 25! Screeching on opening and still playing with a few months later!"
14699,4560,5," i think these are a waste of money but my 5 year old power ranger fan of a son doesnt agree and loves it so guess thats all that matters"
14700,4560,5," Really good had to purchase this as I had already bought two for my other grandson. keeps this grandson really amused"
14701,4560,5," my son loved to play with them over and over. ..  in very good condition"
14702,4560,5," Scary baddie. Good for demonstrating superhero powers."
14703,4560,5," VERY NICE! It was a success with my little one."
14704,4561,5," This is a good product and a great price.  Good service and pleased with product and service. arrived very quickly"
14705,4561,5," Delivered within time scale& was as described and Grandson loved it."
14706,4561,5," As advertised and quick to arrive. Very pleased with this item"
14707,4562,4," felt like infinity on the delivery Lol really good product"
14708,4563,5," This is an amazing figure. The detail the paint the articulation and even the base is all great. The tail is soft with wire tuning through it so it's very poseable. The small inner mouth can extend out and the aliens jaw opens and closes too. And the base is a nicely done broken containment tank and you get a small face hugger to place on it. The face hugger doesn't have any articulation though. Highly recommend this to alien fans."
14709,4563,5," Item was exactly as described and arrived much quicker than expected. Packaging was excellent if being kept as a collectors item."
14710,4564,5," whats not to like about it. its a pop vinyl they are awsome and arrived great love it."
14711,4564,5," It's Pam. It's collectible. It came on time. Fabulous."
14712,4564,5," Quick delivery& good price"
14713,4565,5," Great little set and includes Pats helicopter which some others don't. My son loves it."
14714,4566,3," It's a toy& very boring just goes round and round spinning cup&has a few assossories& not a lot to do&over priced&nosy for the brand nameGet the shopkins fridge instead it's so more much better and fun &this is cheaply made& and goes round n round 3 seconds job of play !!"
14715,4566,5," Excellent! My son's been asking for one of these for a couple of months now& so I know he'll love it when he opens it on his birthday."
14716,4566,5," Great play set!!! I have got some of the new food factory figures and this is a great play set to go with them. -Son's view."
14717,4566,5," Great addition to my kids collection"
14718,4567,4," This Joy figure is from the new Disney Pixar film Inside Out which is released in the UK next month.  The film is all about emotions and how each of us has five emotions controlling our actions from inside our heads.  These emotions are in the form of five characters"
14719,4567,5," nice quality product"
14720,4568,5," My wife love it as it was birthday present"
14721,4568,5," Great item to add to my collection"
14722,4568,5," My sister is very pleased with it"
14723,4568,5," excellent"
14724,4568,5," Great"
14725,4569,4," Lovely little Simba figure. Nice set& but small. Kid loved it!"
14726,4569,5," Great value for money and super quick delivery too!"
14727,4569,5," love it"
14728,4569,5," Great"
14729,4569,4," good"
14730,4570,5," Arrived when stated& as stated. Only thing I'd knock about it is that there are two colours for the elephants ear that are a similar colour so figuring out which sequin went where was a tad tricky& the photo on the box didn't help much either.....but all in all would still recommend this to any one!!"
14731,4570,4," This was a Christmas present for my grand-daughter who chose the picture.  She has not completed this one yet& but has spent many hours on another sequin Art picture which she has completed. It looks very effective."
14732,4570,5," Ideal present for my 9 year old who loves elephants. good practise for using charts and satisfying for someone with some experience of Sequin art."
14733,4570,5," this item is a gift but i know the person who received it loved it and was excited to see the outcome."
14734,4570,5," Arrived a few days later. Good price."
14735,4571,5," Life-size! Looks awesome on display& my son will love it!"
14736,4571,4," My son is very happy"
14737,4572,5," I bought this for my nephew as he loves the new ben 10 Omniverse.Firstly&it wasn't too pricey&which is always a good thing. This figure doesn't have removable bits on it that get lost (tails&weapons etc).Its really colourful&and its well made.My nephew loves it&and his friends seem to pick this figure up first out of all his figures.You also get a mini |blox| with the bigger figure which can be used in a new omnitrix which is out now.  I'd definitely recommend this figure to the parents of the Ben 10 fans."
14738,4572,5," My sone loves this and although he had to wait a few weeks for it& he paid the retail price& not the well over-inflated value some of the Marketplace sellers were selling at. I know it is a supply and demand business but there should be a limit within the rules."
14739,4572,5," This must be the best Ben 10 figure I have bought strong and colourful& my Grandson adored it& just would not put it down. It's  got  to be one of the best toys I have bought him. Would recommend it for any Ben 10 fan."
14740,4572,4," He is much the same as all other ben ten alien toys. very robust. loved by child at time of purchase& he still looks good& but he's fallen out of favour unfortunately."
14741,4572,5," My grandson absolutely adored it.  Would like to know why it was so expensive as opposed to the general price in toy shops.  Was it because toyshops had sold out."
14742,4572,5," My little boy wanted this character for ages and we couldn't find it at the normal high street shops. So when he got it for Christmas just absolutely loved it."
14743,4572,5," We absolutely LOVE Blox.  As usual& this item arrived BEFORE the due date& and was packaged well.  We were very pleased& my little boy was over the moon."
14744,4572,5," I bought this for my nephew's 4th birthday as he loves Ben 10. He was delighted with this figure and it's kept home occupied for hours!"
14745,4573,5," Got sean and ed these guys look so cool in person well happy with them other than pennywise the clown from IT theses are my coolest ones so far"
14746,4573,5," Great brand new condition& arrived on time& perfect figurine."
14747,4573,5," Brilliant love the funko pop figures!! Bb"
14748,4573,5," Great service 5 â˜† â˜† â˜† â˜† â˜†"
14749,4574,4," I would definitely recommend this product to any Legend of Zelda fan with enough money to buy it! It's a brilliant figurine for play& display& or photography& and is made to a very high quality!The body of this figma is astounding& the skirt of Link's tunic is made of a softer flexible plastic& meaning you can pose his legs without it getting in the way. The legs and feet themselves are rather sturdy& and he's very capable of standing even without his stand. The arms are also of equal good quality. His joints are easy to move freely& and won't pop out unless you force them& and despite my expectations& his adaptable hat actually looks very effective in photographs.The interchangeable pieces all work brilliantly. The expressions are exactly like the actual Link in-game& and his sword and shield will fit into either hand and onto his back& and there's even a second place to attach his stand whilst he's wearing sword and shield. The effect for his sword works brilliantly and looks amazing in photographs.The only real issue I have with this figure is that his sword is not easy to fit into his hand. I read about many people on-line who tried to pop open the sword or to force it into Link's hand& and ended up breaking the sword (which is very thin and could easily break). The way I solved this issue was I ran Link's sword-holding hand under hot water until the plastic softened& opened up the grip a little more& than ran it under cold water to set it. This makes slipping the sword in and out of hand much easier.Overall& a brilliant quality action figure& and definitely worth the money you pay for it& just be careful with his sword!"
14750,4574,5," Good things+ very good craftsmanship& looks exactly like Link from Zelda: Skyward Sword+ excellent materials& giving it a nice fell especially the tunic+ highly pose-able& can stand on its own most of the time+ good accessories& especially the sword"
14751,4574,5," This figure is one nice figure. Excellently built and has solid articulated limbs. The paint job is fantastic and the arm to hold link in place is sturdy and dosnt feel cheap. The spare hands are held in a small piece of plastic which is nice and |handy| also comes with a small bag. The small details are brilliant especially the master sword and shield. If your after a link figure this is the figure to have!"
14752,4574,5," My daughter just loves it.  The details are very accurate. Although it is quite fragile& has to be handled with care.Also the delivery was much quicker than expected!"
14753,4574,5," Very detailed& deserves a 5 star ratingOnly flaws I found loose wrists& can't always support weight of sword& and supporting shield on his back is loose as it balances between sword sleeve and shield handle."
14754,4574,5," A really high quality product& and a wonderful item for any major zelda fan :). I love mine! And have taken many photos of him.Just awesome ðŸ˜€"
14755,4574,4," I've only just started to collect these figures& and this Link figma is a perfect addition to any collection! I ordered it a while ago& but it came within the dates given for delivery and I am very impressed.It is so detailed and has so many moveable parts so you can make a number of different poses for him. It comes with two different faces& ten different hands& a shield& a sword& a scabbard for the sword& spare hair& a blue effect to go on the sword and make it look as though he is doing a skyward strike& and& finally& a moveable stand to keep him upright in his dynamic poses.The only thing I have a problem with is the fact the handle of the sword is quite thin and it broke from the sword. This may have been partially my fault& of course& and it has been stuck back on with super glue& but it's just a warning to any buyers that some parts are delicate and you need to be careful.I put him in a different pose all the time and I am very impressed with this purchase! A must for any TLoZ fan!"
14756,4574,4," Like other reviews& I think the overall quality is pretty good. I suppose I have to take into account that it is a Japanese import but I thought it was a little overpriced for what you got. I bought this a gift for my youngest son who is a mad Zelda fan so no surprises in that he loves it."
14757,4575,5," I bought this playmat for my grandson's 2nd birthday.  He loves it and I hope to add to it in the future."
14758,4576,5," Very pleased with product"
14759,4577,5," Didn't buy on amazon but it was the same price. go amazon because its safer.All i can say is I LOVE THIS RUMPLETILTSKIN!!!!! this is by far my favourite Funko Pop ever! the writing on the dagger is super small but you can still just read it.  A perfect gift for any ONCER / Once Upon A Time fan :)"
14760,4577,5," Absolutely had to buy it as a Dearie and Oncer for my mum to buy me as a Christmas present. Not disappointed at all and collecting them one by one."
14761,4577,5," This is a present for my daughter& she is a massive OUAT fan and i think she will love this. It came on time and i am hoping she will start collecting the other characters :)"
14762,4577,5," Great item and fast delivery daughter loved it"
14763,4577,5," Very happy with this item"
14764,4577,4," He's absolutely perfect and got here the next day& like it said. However& there was a great big crack in the pop figure box itself. I love to keep mine in the original boxes and its saddens me there is damage already to it when it should have been brand new!! That I was not happy about. Otherwise everything was perfect! :)"
14765,4577,5," Thankyou so much for getting it to me before Xmas. Excellent present."
14766,4577,5," Got it for my sister who a big once upon a time fan she loved it xxx"
14767,4578,5," OK& its a very easy to build out of the box& fun little kit. I think 99% of these must be sold to photographers as Flickr is full of Danbo's in various poses around the World. This is exactly why I got mine& but to be different& and thinking of the fact he is supposed to be made of cardboard& I painted mine and wehthered him substantially uses Tamiya weathering kits& no in my opinion he looks more realistic.Great kit& not always easy to get& buy one!"
14768,4578,5," ik ben  zeer tevreden over dit produkt en zeker oven a m a m z o n e .c o m uk"
14769,4578,5," Fairly robust& unlike a smaller version I have."
14770,4579,5," Its a must to pic up if your a collector of lego minifigures series it came in original packaging and came in good condition as I missed series one I was amazed I found one and the price is good as it is hard to pick up"
14771,4579,4," I bought it for my son who is mad about Lego and loves to build anything with his dynamic ideas to put people inside any construction buildings or transport. Good value price of this lego minifigures. Cute!!!"
14772,4579,5," Nothing more to say other than it is Lego and of quality expected by them. Just right for table top decoration"
14773,4580,1," I purchased a number of these when they were reduced at at local supermarket. Nearly all of them are now broken. The basic skeleton parts are made from quite a rigid plastic and the ends that clip& are easily broken. The problem appears to be that the ball end joints are quite stiff and difficult to move. When these parts are forced it tranfers the load onto the rigid plastic clip end of the joint causing them to fracture and break.  My son isn't rough with his toys& he usually keeps them toys in their robot form and just uses them as dolls which he wants me to 'make them talk' for him. When he wants them to be transformed he gets me to do it so I know that none of the toys have been forced. These toys are just made from a material that is just not fit for use and Hasbro should not have released a toy that is broken so easily. I have tried to contact hasbro to get replacement parts which I would have been happy to pay for if necessary& just so my son can play with them again. As yet I have had no responce."
14774,4580,5," Great value& looks good& just what the little lad wanted for his present and a good size&"
14775,4580,5," My son loves this and once put together it's a lot bigger than I fort it  would be"
14776,4580,4," Prompt delivery& goods as described"
14777,4581,3," Fast delivery - in fact three days early which is great. Decently packed& happy days. Right now as for the pop itself& great addition for a horror pop collection and surprising they aren't as commonly found as the freddy& jason etc. Nice design but few little poor finishes on the side and back of the head which left big cracks and just seem a little thrown together and rushed which took away from the overall look and that's why for me it's not a 5star pop but other then that a nice addition. Pinhead is a great look but for me poorly made and put it this way if I had inspected it closely like in a shop I would not have bought it& just a bit dispappoint coz for me this was one pop I thought could be so cool."
14778,4581,5," These are toys& they are small bundles of pure vinyl joy& Funko Pop have distilled the very essence of the characters to create a thing of joy and wonder& don't let the fact that you are a grown man put you off buying these& trust me once you have purchased one you will keep on buying them until every available surface is covered with effigies from favourite films and TV shows.  Pinhead has never looked so cute"
14779,4581,5," Excellent..Don't open the box& or else.."
14780,4581,5," I absolutely adore Pinhead from the Hellraiser movies& so I jumped at the chance of purchasing this little gem. It's cute& and a treat for Hellraiser fans."
14781,4581,5," Amazing product! Arrived early which is brilliant& it was a gift for my mum and she loved it :)"
14782,4581,5," this was brought as a gift but looks fantastic very happy"
14783,4581,5," So cute My boyfriend loves it!!!"
14784,4582,5," Fab item used as a cake topper"
14785,4582,5," Fab figure"
14786,4583,5," All godd"
14787,4584,5," Zorima is the Japanese name of the Super Sentai counterparts of Power Rangers: Dino Charge latest henchmen the Vivix. Rest assured this figure itself is labelled with the Power Rangers: Dino Charge branding as Vivix& not sure why Amazon have used the Sentai name. The figure features no accessories like the cool arm weapon the Vivix carry on TV but it does look really great& with spiked edges to the costume and etched in designs on his suit. Along with his bright green hair and swirly mask design the figure really stands out from the usual Power Ranger henchmen. The figure has articulation in the shoulders& arms& hands& top of legs& knees and head& similar to the Ranger figures but just note due to his long hair the head can't do a full swivel.

14799,4586,5," THIS IS THE HUNGER GAMES GENUINE MOCKINGJAY PART 1 BROOCH-PIN BY NECA"

14802,4587,3," Magnetic back is useless. Its not so magnetic"
14803,4587,5," My son loved it .very good quality"
14804,4588,5," We were surprised to receive these Hulk fists! My middle son is a huge Hulk fan and found my wife's phone and used the 1Click service... we had no idea until we signed for them and then looked at our statement :) Lesson learned!Needless to say our son was thrilled... and so were we. These Hulk fists have brought many a laugh to our home and we all dish out some playful Hulk love from time to time.The gloves fit adult hands and child's hands (my son was 4 when he got them) and there is a useful grip on the inside of them to hold onto.They have worn well and are still as good as new even though my sons play with them regularly. The material is soft and does not tear or deform. The fist just springs back into place.I particularly love the realistic veins... and the colour of the Hulk hands is awesome... hahaIf you are a Hulk fan then these are a lot of fun - though we did wince at the price at the time. However& they are really well made and will last a long time."
14805,4588,5," This toy went down a treat with 4yr old& the hands have a small bar inside to hold onto& soft enough not to cause too much damage if used by an excited child yet firm enough to make them last without splitting."
14806,4588,2," A lot of money for what is foam gloves& a critism on the r.r.p and manufacturer& HASBRO  : ( boooMight be better off with a fake pair from ebay& I dont think your average 2/3 year old will mind!"
14807,4588,5," I can't see the point of them but my 5 tear old grandson loves them and he wears them non stop when he is at home - they even went to school today for the Christmas Party."
14808,4588,2," Not like the picture. At all. Smaller than the picture. I bought these thinking they were the originals from years back but they are not what so ever I'm gutted"
14809,4588,3," I thought theyt were expensive for foam rubber hands& with no sound effects like the older versions"
14810,4588,5," Loved by the four year old"
14811,4588,5," Brilliant for the kids. Big but soft and alot.of fun to be had with them."
14812,4589,5," Ideally my 7 year old son would like 100 of these for a real Roman army. This is a great quality minifig and the detail on the plumage is cool."
14813,4589,5," very loving rendition of the centurion and intricately created to lead the ranks of your army into battle a must for lego or roman army fans"
14814,4589,5," OMG DIS IS THE BEST MINIFIG EVRERRRR. DETAIL I S SIKK AND HATS FREAKIN SWEET. TOOK ME TIME TO FIGUR OWT HE GOT SANDALZ DO. LEGO <3"

14827,4595,5," Open the packet and out comes two more moshi monsters to add to your collection and a free code for the computer game"
14828,4595,5," It's a bag of Moshi Monsters. The kids love them& what's not to like."
14829,4595,5," Always a hit with my moshi mad daughter"
14830,4596,5," I tortured myself about getting this for my daughter. In the end I gave in. Well he was hidden out of the way on Christmas morning and when my daughter eventually seen it she actually shed a tear. So glad it was got. A priceless moment tbh.Comes well packed. And this was by far the cheapest available. It is simply cardboard and a bit tacky but for a 1d fan if I am being honest is a good buy."
14831,4596,3," Great addition to my room& great for scaring people!Only 3 stars because the legs are very short compared to the body so he stands behind the desk"
14832,4596,5," Purchased for my daughters Xmas absolutely loved it when she got up on Xmas morning..possibly the best present ever!!  Received within timescale.."

14834,4596,5," Quick delivery and a quality item"
14835,4597,5," Took a while to put together but what a great toy which will last for years. I bought it for my 4 1/2 year old special needs grandson as he's really at age 2. There is loads to engage with& you turn the handle"
14836,4598,5," Arrived much quicker than expected& my 6 year old loved it& great quality& good price and interesting to build with good instructions& can't fault it at all!"
14837,4598,5," Brilliantly made&my son loves it."

14839,4599,5," Was bought for a friend as a present and they loved it! Folds up into a small compact size however it literally is lifesize. Printing seemed to be a reasonably high quality& could have been better."
14840,4599,5," I bought this for my friend for her birthday as she's a massive fan of BeyoncÃ©& and she loved it. I would definitely recommend this as a purchase for any BeyoncÃ© fans."
14841,4599,5," exactly as expected!"
14842,4599,5," Love it"
14843,4600,2," Disappointed with this product as thought the different dino chargers you buy enabled this part to make different sounds. It doesn't. Just had pre set sounds. Thought the point of buying the dino chargers was for this. Makes them not so good either. Could have been a really good toy as my son loves power rangers dino charge."
14844,4600,5," Our five-year old grandson loved it - and it meant that all of his charged cartridges could be kept together (all except the pink one!! which he elected to leave out because he doesn't like pink!). A good buy"
14845,4600,5," Great toy& built to last and great for imaginative play for all power ranger fans and a good way to store 3 of the Dino chargers."
14846,4600,4," Our little man is well happy now he has somewhere to store and carry his chargers."
14847,4600,5," It has not been opened yet it's a Christmas present"
14848,4600,4," most wanted gift for son alot cheaper in feeling"
14849,4601,3," The item arrived in good time& and was as described in contents! However they are a little over priced for what you get! They are small figures yet on the photo look bigger. They however were for a rugrats fan who loved them."
14850,4601,5," Bought these for my son's 2nd birthday along with the Rugrats movie. They look just like the rugrats and aren't too small. My son loves playing with figures so he'll love these."
14851,4602,5," Xmas present for my guardians of the galaxy mad 6 year old - looks fab"
14852,4602,5," Very good prompt service& product is good qualityðŸ˜€"
14853,4602,5," Excellent value for money&a great toy for a child or collectors item.Very nicely detailed and has electronic lights and sound.Has room for three small figures&you get a peter quill figure with the ship.BTW figures are very small but go well with the starship.A nice set at a very good price&mines was Â£12.50."
14854,4602,5," Gift for grandson. He loved it"
14855,4602,4," a gift that was well received"
14856,4603,5," I love this little figures just cute and funny& looks great on my game station!"
14857,4603,5," Just started too collect these they are a bit pricey but they are really well made and the detail great."
14858,4603,5," delivery was good. very satisfied."
14859,4603,5," Good thanks"
14860,4604,5," I saw this"
14861,4604,5," Superb. Worth every penny! Everyone should have a Keith in their house!!"
14862,4605,3," The bottom of the bust was damaged when I opened the packaging but too late to send back as I had purchased it in October as a Christmas gift. However& I didn't intend it to be a money box. Will try to glue it"
14863,4605,5," I loved this and I'm an OAP. but it was for my son and he is really happy"
14864,4605,5," Much better than expected"
14865,4606,5," A truly breathtaking collectible figure that is an uncanny likeness of Christopher Reeve. The toy we all dreamed of at the time of the movies is finally here!"
14866,4606,5," Neca do it again! This figure is absolutely superb. A fantastic representation of cinema's one true Superman& the late Christopher Reeve. The facial sculpt is spot on and captures Reeve at his brooding best. The pictures really don't do this figure justice as it is huge and so well detailed for the price (as opposed to the Hot Toys half the size/double the price version). Get this now before the price trebles (and it will very quickly) and show off one of cinema's most iconic characters in your own home. You won't be disappointed!!"
14867,4606,5," As a long time prop and memorabilia maker and collector& it's not very often I receive a package& open it up and say WOOOOW!This figure is phenomenal.Having owned the hot toys 12| version& I thought nothing could top that but I was wrong. This is better.The room presence is amazing. Having viewed the photos and videos reviews& this thing is so much better in person.If you're on the fence& don't be. Just buy it."
14868,4606,5," Neca does it again& another great 1/4 scale figure of the real man of steel& the late and great Christopher Reeve."
14869,4607,5," Bought for a friend for his birthday& he loved it. Defo recommend"
14870,4607,5," Great product just what I wanted"
14871,4608,3," I would warn other buyers that this Character product is about 3 mm too small for the Born to Play brand characters which are sold as a set of five& including nurse Flood and Norman& even though the figures look exactly the same on screen. 4 yo very disappointed on recent birthday. Have had to go to the expense of buying a second helicopter and Jupiter (born to play brand this time) so that the figures fit."
14872,4608,5," Bought this for my grandsons 3rd birthday to go with the Ocean play set& as it is the right size to go on the helipad. A good toy& my grandson has the bigger one as well. He loves both of them."
14873,4608,2," Doesn't make sound like it used to"
14874,4608,5," Lovely toy and fast delivery"
14875,4609,5," it is genuine and well worth the money. It comes with many pieces including 3 stands& 4 clouds& bullet bill& goomba& a pipe and of course- the Luigi nendoroid himself."
14876,4610,4," a present for grandson."
14877,4611,1," I buy 3 mini figure which cost Â£16.50 and cost me Â£13.89 for postage and packing not happy with postage charges it to much& not recommend to anyone!"
14878,4611,5," My Grandson is playing and enjoying this Item. From my point of view they are rather expensive but Boys seem to love them and we indulge& don't we?"
14879,4611,4," This item had been bought as a Birthday Present. I am sure the little boy will enjoy it. It looks great."
14880,4612,5," I am a HP fan and already have Dumbledore and the Harry Potter sword one. The Hagrid is nearly twice as tall as them as he's half giant which is a thought I wasn't expecting and never really considered& but it's a lovely thought put into the size of him compared to the other ones& it's perfect as a present for a HP fan if you're stuck on what to buy :)"
14881,4612,5," Sometimes when you order pop vinyls off the internet the box can be a bit scuffed and used but this was absolutely brand new! Immaculate condition. Amazing all round. Came 4 days before expected date too& very happy."
14882,4612,5," Excellent figure good quality well worth the money arrived quickly package in good order"
14883,4612,1," Love this pop figure but it was broken in the box and im really disapointed"
14884,4612,5," Great figure! He looks very cute and is larger than other Pop Vinyl figures"
14885,4612,4," Prompt delivery. It's s Christmas present but my daughter will love it!!"
14886,4612,5," Bought as a xmas present& for my 'Harry porter' mad daughter."
14887,4612,4," looks good& however box slightly damaged and unsealefd"
14888,4613,5," Im a huge fan of juggernaut and this is a must have for any juggernaut fan. Kotobukiya never disappoints i really like the pose& paint job and size hes my favourite statue to date 10/10"
14889,4613,5," Great quality statue& extremely detailed and well painted. Also limited edition! If you're an X-Men or Juggernaut fan I would highly recommend this statue!"
14890,4614,5," Lovely figure. Looks good on my shelf along with Tyrion and Daeny."
14891,4614,5," The recipient was very pleased with this present."
14892,4614,2," Was disappointed as the box was damaged and it didn't state so in the description"
14893,4615,1," Very disappointed with this purchase& turned up with a missing piece& had a disappointed 5 year old to deal with..."
14894,4615,4," Chuffed with this one been after it for ages but to expensive a good buy"
14895,4615,5," Really cool figure what I was looking for totally worth it!"
14896,4615,5," Perfect"
14897,4615,5," Rockin"
14898,4616,5," Finally got mine from Amazon after having the release date pushed back so many times.The box for this is so huge& not sure if people will have to room to store these boxed.Make sure you purchase this official version as there are some versions doing the rounds which were exclusive to Toys 'R' Us in America& but those do not include the Rooftop Gozer Temple diorama.  These sets are even sometimes more expensive than this full release so don't get caught out.I would say if you are a Ghostbusters fan then get these now while you can before they sell out."
14899,4617,5," really nice figurine great for any frozen collectors but I wouldn't pay the Â£ 20 originally asked for"
14900,4618,5," A very well made puzzle - as always with Trefl."
14901,4618,3," gosh this was hard - not for the faint hearted"
14902,4620,5," This is a very girly and very pretty little mermaid figure. She has detachable long blonde wavy hair& a fish tail body ( no legs she balances on the wide part of her tail with the fins at the end flicking up behind her) and she is holding a lovely orange star fish.She has a clam shell bra to cover her modesty and is a great piece for a mini figure collector to add to their collection."
14903,4620,3," All it's worth. Cheap but very very small. Wish I had read more about the product size then might have bought one larger"
14904,4620,5," Great I ordered it for my grandson who hadlost his previous one he ws really happy to receive it"
14905,4620,5," This was another purchase specifically to enhance our Lego Ariel set.  The poor mermaid now stars as either Ursula or Medusa.  Yep& you have to have seen the film.  We were after an Octopus& but my 5 year old was delighted with these.  We have a mini fig witch and we use her hair (black) and top to make this mermaid look more 'baddie' like."
14906,4620,3," Only giving 3 stars as product fine but packaging all damaged as had been opened I guess to see whether or not mermaid was inside  - was not ideal as was giving as part of a present. Otherwise good product and good delivery"
14907,4620,2," bought this as extra figure for grandaughters birthday - was very disappointed at how small this is - as after seeing photos asssumed it was larger - therefore suitable for a 3yr old to play with. Otherwise OK."
14908,4621,2," Good. Delivered just  next day. My son is so happy to have his toy."
14909,4621,5," delighted with my puchase& exactly what i was looking for!!"
14910,4621,5," Parfait Ã  fait le bonheur de mon fils"
14911,4621,5," My boy loves this toy!"
14912,4622,4," as expected"
14913,4623,5," Very good product my little boys loves it."
14914,4623,4," Pleased"
14915,4624,5," Exactly what we were looking for& good quality and easily manipulated without the chance of breaking. Great substitute for poorer quality ones where the tails always broke."
14916,4624,5," Very good solid toy.. Good quality"
14917,4624,5," Strong durable play figure"
14918,4625,4," This is a very simple toy& while there are a few bells and whistles& they donâ€™t do much.  If you push the head plume forward& Mercâ€™s eyes pop out a bit& only about a quarter of an inch. There is a button on his lower back that when pressed will cause one of eight sounds to be made. At the same time the wings light up. The head can be turned through a full 360 degrees but will not bob as the long neck is rigid. The legs will bend forward approximately 30 degrees at the knees and rotate about ninety degrees at the hip joint. The wings do not rotate& but they pop off easily. They are connected by simple pegs in holes and can be easily and quickly reattached. This is one of those toys where the primary attraction is as an action figure tie-in to a cartoon series. It does not do a whole lot& the few options will lead to boredom for most children rather quickly."
14919,4626,5," Great looking figure& very happy indeed :)"
14920,4627,5," BEAUTIFULL PRODUCT!!!! Spider-Man fans Will LOVE This. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED!!! Fast Delivery& secure an safe packaging!! Top seller 5*****â¤ï¸"
14921,4628,5," Its a small figure and you can do little with it except dump it along the ground and make noises during imaginary play. It is what it says it is nothing more nothing less."
14922,4628,5," My little boy is a Power Rangers fan and this figure went down very well& he loves it.  Good value for money and a fast and efficient service ðŸ˜„"
14923,4628,5," my grandson hasnt stopped playing with his power rangers.Unbreakable iam glad to say as they are twisted into every position"
14924,4628,4," good quality& just what my grandson wanted& although smaller than I expected. Would recommend this for any child who is in to power rangers."
14925,4628,4," The toy is made out of very good plastic and rock solid toy. My son loves his new power rangers figurine."
14926,4628,1," Was sent 2 of the same when I chose 2 diff colours so not happy tbh toys are ok but long to complain"
14927,4628,5," Perfect  for my Grandson he as played with this and the other one many hours. Good quality"
14928,4628,1," Fell apart in a day my 5 year old was very upset.  Small and swords just drops off"
14929,4629,5," Happy with my purchase altho seen others with mike figurine and for cheaper"
14930,4629,3," Side mirrors broke off within 3 days with my 3 year old boy driving them"
14931,4629,5," My son loves mikes van spends hours playing with it"
14932,4629,4," Good but would have liked Mike figure with it ."
14933,4630,5," Starting with his hair style& strawberry-blond colour& nicely sculpted& and his facial expression or likeness of the actor Chris Hemsworth. Since he does not have the Asgard armour on& showing off his muscular body tone& also he is a little bit tanned than before. His cape is more crimson red than red delicious apples. The lightning effect is good& but not perfect. Package comes with 2 Mjolnirs. One is regular& quite heavy& like you're holding a small roll of coins"
14934,4631,5," love this it comes in a glass case which a nice touch great for fans for the resident evil series."
14935,4631,5," I am giving this a 5 star rating because it came without breakage and had arrived when i had hoped"
14936,4632,5," This arrived very quickly but cant understand how come the figure was cheap& but the postage was so expensive.  Still Grandson loved it& as he had lost his original.  Thanks"
14937,4632,5," really good minifigure& my son loved it as he has got the outhers in this outfit and it come earley."
14938,4632,5," Another quality lego figure to add to my grandsons collection.Very prompt delivery."
14939,4632,5," Excellent - genuine Lego products& very pleased... I mean my son was...!"
14940,4633,5," Bought as a gift for my 3 year old son. He loves it. We've had it for a few months and still have all the bits and it hasn't broken yet!"
14941,4633,5," Fantastic product really happy"
14942,4633,4," My grandson love's it."
14943,4634,4," I spent what I consided a foolish amount on this mini figure but was rewarded with a delighted 7 year old who& despite having not see the films& thinks Jack Sparrow is the best pirate/person ever&...such clever marketing from the lego website...great detail& the hair/hat is one piece but that doesn't spoil it for us."
14944,4634,5," This year I made my own Christmas crackers and needed suitable gifts to fit inside.  Bought this figure to put in my son's cracker and he was absolutely delighted with it!  Arrived very promptly and would recommend the supplier as I did not experience any problems."
14945,4634,5," Item only passed on as birthday present yesterday so as yet have no idea how durable etc it might be.  As novelty value I thought it was great.  Am now thinking of buying one for my 29 year old as well!"
14946,4634,1," Did not include his head for some reason. This gift was opened today so need to report to the seller."
14947,4635,5," Very pleased. Purchased as a present."
14948,4636,5," A beautiful addition to our growing Harry Potter collection. It is a brilliant replica by Noble and will be taking pride of place in our sitting room."
14949,4637,5," These are great. I would recommend them. They are very robust and I think children with ASD will love them. They make you smile whatever your mood!"
14950,4637,4," Found it quite fun to twist the little figures into different positions.  Even more fun to combine the figures into poses and situations.  Little disappointing that the internal wire showed through within a few weeks.  Would also be better if the 3 characters had different facial expressions.Overall good."
14951,4637,4," Bought these for a young person with ADHD to occupy his hands. he wasn`t sure at first& but has found them helpful."
14952,4637,5," Cant go wrong with these as such fun to play with. Goes well with rest of my stuff in my self soothe box"
14953,4638,5," Bought for my youngest grand-daughter& who is totally gorgeous and B"
14954,4638,5," One month in and it still gets Daily play!! Our 2 and a half yr old loves itQuite a good price for what you get ..we already had Ben and gaston which helps a bit for her to act out little scenariosUtterly absorbed"
14955,4638,5," My 2 year old daughter loves this because its got lots of little tidbits to mess around with. Much better than the peppa pig playground sets weve got"
14956,4638,5," My 3 year old loves this. She plays with it constantly& making up stories and games as she goes. I've even bought it as a birthday present for her friend"
14957,4638,5," Bought for a 3 year olds birthday present and he loves it . Lots of wee surprise moving parts keeps him entertained for ages well worth the money"
14958,4638,5," Fantastic and niece loved it."
14959,4638,1," Bought as a present for a relative. Although I'm sure that my niece will enjoy playing with this& I can't help but feel like I've paid a lot of money for a bit of cheap plastic. The cardboard box makes up a lot of the 'toy' here. So once unwrapped& you've bought a small piece of plastic that doesn't look very durable."
14960,4638,4," Great success with grand-daughter but the figure are really irritating as they fall over all the time - you have to insert their feet into small pieces of plastic to make them stand up - these get lost and then you just have top heavy figures falling all over the place - bad design"
14961,4639,5," Got this for my boy at Christmas and both of us love it! As per usual for Playmobil it is expensive but for that you get a well made and durable toy."
14962,4639,5," Bought this over a year ago. Amazingly after all the pounding it got from my son it still works flawlessly . Extremely resistant product. wish all toys were built to this standard"
14963,4639,4," grandkids love lego."
14964,4640,4," Daddy couldn't wait for the baby to grow& so he bought it for himself and he loves it! The tiny suitcase opens!"
14965,4640,5," Ordered this toy as my boy was collecting the set of figures and he needed just 4 to complete it and I did not want to keep gambling. The speed of delivery was excellent and the figure was packaged as expected."
14966,4640,5," This was the last mini figure my partner needed to complete their minifigure collection. Really nice little figure - the violin case is hollow so you can hide the gun inside!!!!"
14967,4640,4," this was one item for my grandaughers collection and she was very happy with it& it was one of a few i had bought for her for her birthday"
14968,4641,5," Brilliant& my grandson loves it"
14969,4641,5," my son loves them thank you"
14970,4641,5," GREAT"
14971,4642,5," A bit expensive for one little figure but my son was delighted....my purse wasn't"
14972,4642,5," Expensive for an inch! Son loves his titanium ZANE!"
14973,4642,5," A popular figure of the kids. Comes in great quality like all LEGO items."
14974,4642,4," My son loves it& but no box a little expensive"
14975,4642,5," One very happy son!"
14976,4643,4," Item arrived promptly and for a figure that we have not been able to get in a set but was wanted by my son& being able to just purchase the figure is handy. As usual for lego item may not seem much for the price however for me it is worth it because they are played with constantly. A great lego figure."
14977,4644,5," Wasn't sure whether I wanted to shed out Â£30 for this but as soon as it arrived I was SO glad I bought it! LOVE IT! It's gonna make a perfect prop for my leaving party this summer! :)"
14978,4644,5," Bought this item for a las Vegas themed party& arrived very quickly& item is very sturdy& and folds away neatly when not required"
14979,4644,5," This is fantastic!!!! The picture really doesn't do it justice! Its 7ft tall and so easy to assemble!! Cant wait to use it for my party next week! Super fast delivery too! Many thanks!"
14980,4644,5," Arrived well packed.  Brilliant product& everyone had great fun with this& if I was having a different themed party I would buy another cut out"
14981,4644,4," Looks fabulous but not sure if it will last the whole party with so many guest as it is not printed on the thickest cardboard"
14982,4644,5," Absolutely amazing the photo doesn't do it justice!  Perfect for our vegas themed wedding!  Definitely recommend"
14983,4645,5," Ideal as usual"
14984,4646,5," My daughter is obsessed with pokemon& has been for years& and when she recieved this i thought her eyes were gonna pop out. This is great quality and well worth the buy :)"
14985,4646,4," I was surprised how small this item was but the little boy i bought it for was v. Pleased. He had requested it"
14986,4646,5," My son loved this was really happy with it.Goid seller highly recommend"
14987,4646,5," great addition to my kids collection of pokemon"
14988,4647,5," Fast delivery. Highly recommend. Thank you"
14989,4647,5," superb"
14990,4648,5," really great for kids to collect. My daugher found it hard to get these figures and get getting doublers which was a waste of money& this way she got the ones she was missing. thanks."
14991,4648,5," Arrived fairly quickly ( weather may have had something to do with a slight delay) Son happy.  It's Lego so no complaints"
14992,4648,5," amazing figure& buy it& you wont regret it& isnt bent like in the photo though unfortunate. but still good :D"
14993,4648,5," great"
14994,4649,4," Nice very detailed figure& but limbs feels delicate and getting the bass into her hands is extremely fiddly and would not be play-friendly. Additionally& the face is swapped by detaching the hair from her head& and the head from the body - and the latter seems to require an extreme amount of force to do. In the end I gave up because I was afraid of damaging the figure& which is unfortunate because the |scary| face is a lot more detailed. She does come with a sturdy stand which attaches to the back of her hair."
14995,4649,5," I love this product& and I've had it for quite some time now. The price was good and the product hasn't broken yet so it's obviously made really well. A must for any and all adventure time fans."
14996,4649,3," I feel this is so expensive for such a small figure but on the good side my Granddaughter loved it!  She had asked for this as a Christmas gift and has it in her room on display."
14997,4649,3," Not a bad figure but you have to be quite careful of the limbs and specially the arms & still a great figure for a collector"
14998,4649,4," Present for an Adventure Time loving friend who plays bass. She loved it. No idea on quality as its still in box!"
14999,4649,5," Bought as a gift for an Adventure time loving guitar player& it was well received!"
15000,4650,4," A great toy which my daughter loves. My only issue is that for store security they screwed it into the box and I foolishly didn't keep the screws to put back in so now the boat has stale water sloshing inside it which doesn't come out so I suggest you seal the holes before letting it go in water."
15001,4650,2," Bought this for my 4 year old and she loved it. However& it says it can go on water so we put it in the bath and now water is trapped inside the boat and it won't float. Not a great design and very disappointing for the price."
15002,4650,4," Bought for my five year old foster daughter who is a huge Peppa pig fan it is made extremely well from hard plastic she playes it for hours with her other peppa toys I have had no issues with this toy so far and would happily recommend it."
15003,4650,2," The ship is so beautiful.. My son& 3 years and a half& loves it.. but.. really& the boat is sinking because it got too much water inside.. I knew that this happen before buying it.. I read the other reviews.. but I read that you can avoid it you leave the screws on.. That was not my case at least. And even if I remove them I cannot take the water out. A pity!"
15004,4650,5," My grandson has a great time playing with Grandpa Pig's boat when its his bathtime but also he likes to play with anytime alongside his other peppa pig toys.  Its well made and of good quality.  Would recommend to all little Peppa Pig fans."
15005,4650,1," Could not be more pleased Was my first response however. First bath time immediately filled with water. Complete rubbish as a bath you"
15006,4650,5," My 2 year old loves it and it makes bath time even more fun. Would defiantly recommend as it is really robust and bigger than I expected& it's been lashed everywhere and hasn't sunk."
15007,4650,3," I actually do like this but it somehow let in water first time used in the bath and there seems to be no way to get it out. Eventually& therefore& it will sink..."
15008,4651,4," Fast delivery and it fits well... 2 right handed gloves though& and belt not cut straight buy other than that not bad. Fingers in gloves not cut well either"
15009,4652,5," I love it. I did get sent the wrong item originally& but it was sorted with in minutes& even received the correct item before I posted the other one back. Very helpful and lovely people to deal with. The item its self is brilliant"
15010,4652,4," It's really good and highly detailed. The head is made of a different material to the armour and has a less glossy finish. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. The sand trooper model is better than the standard stormtrooper model I here&because the head isn't sunk down as much into shoulders(according to a YouTube revuew). Glad I bought it !! my next purchase will be a biker scout 18|."
15011,4652,5," This is one of the best looking stormtroopers out there& a must have for any star wars fan I will be getting more of these to add to my collection"
15012,4653,5," Brilliant item"
15013,4654,5," Bought for a village Royal Wedding Party.  It will be perfect and just what we were hoping for!  Very quick and efficient service.  Highly recommended."
15014,4654,4," The purchase came slightly damaged but in view of time needed for too late to send back... They very kindly offered  a partial refund. The cutout itself is good and was effective for what we needed it for. The packaging probably was a fault but that is easily resolved."
15015,4654,5," Had the happy couple waiting outside the door to welcome guests to my Royal Wedding Party.  What a hoot!  They have since made another couple of appearances at other Royal Family linked events& and also on my balcony - no kissing though!"
15016,4654,5," Really brilliant. Good quality. Was delivered within a week and packaged really well. Went down a storm at our street party. Got lots of great photos."
15017,4654,5," We bought this as we got married the day after Will and Kate& and it was brilliant to have them join us for our special day!"
15018,4655,4," Bought this for my daughters birthday as she loves bin weevils& arrived on time and well packaged.Does nt seem to be a lot for your money but she loved it and has added to her collection.Figures are good quality. Overall happy with this product."
15019,4655,5," My grandson plays and plays and plays with the figuires."
15020,4656,5," This came up as a 'we thought you'd like'& and yes I did like& I have always wanted the rank pins& and the insignia& so I bought this& and it is just perfect."
15021,4656,4," Very good quality badge set made of nice metal!My only gripe is that the main badge is actually quite heavy so sags a fair bit on loose clothing.Will make a great present for any Star Trek enthusiast!"
15022,4656,5," Lovely set . Very happy..came ingood time so no complaints.. which is all I have to say but need nine more words :-)"
15023,4656,5," Very happy :)"
15024,4657,4," I believe the recipient liked it& it was a gift!"
15025,4657,5," A fantastic successful present for a fan of the film.  Will have to buy again for all my grandsons who all love the book."
15026,4657,3," My 3-year-old son loves this toy! The detail on the toys is great and would definitely appeal to a fan of the films. However& within two days of buying it I had to repair two different parts of it - one of the dragon's feet kept falling off and one of the wings kept falling off because the pin holding it on falls out. Fortunately superglue did the trick!"
15027,4657,4," as described"
15028,4657,5," Great toy"
15029,4658,5," Great value - my son prefers playing with the individual figures rather than lots of building so great to buy them on their own."
15030,4658,4," Was missing from our original collection :)"
15031,4658,5," as described"
15032,4659,5," The Lego figure arrived promptly and was exactly as described in the sellers info. We had purchased many of the packs in a shop to end up with duplicates of other figures but the only one my son wanted proved elusive! He was over the moon to get the mermaid figure and because it was sealed in its packaging he thought it was his lucky day (he even made a little wish before he opened it!) Would recommend to anyone searching for a specific figure for their child or to those looking to complete their collections."
15033,4659,5," Yes you're paying over the odds but if you don't want to waste your life in the lego shop feeling at small packets and trying to guess the contents& only to find there was never a mermaid amongst them in the first place& then this is worth every penny. Got the mermaid just as described."
15034,4659,5," Love it.  Arrived super quick& my daughter is thrilled.  Enjoying playing with the figures from the lego movie."
15035,4659,5," Excellent fast delivery& item as described"
15036,4659,4," great"
15037,4660,4," I got this game for my niece who is 11 and she enjoyed it for about 3-4 cards.  However& the adults in the group liked it a lot more and played it for a good 30 minutes.  I would recommend giving kids longer than 1 minute to remember everything on the card and maybe giving them 2 roles of the di per turn.  Otherwise& you get one wrong and then it's over.The artwork is a good variety of paintings from several different artists/centuries and they are big enough to get an idea of the painting.  Some of the facts are really interesting& while others are a bit trivial.overall& it's a creative idea for learning.  I definitely enjoyed it& even though it may not have given my niece the oo aww sensation of a new video game."
15038,4660,5," What a super game for the family!Even the youngest can take part and without conscious effort everyone becomes familiar with famous works of art& absorbing information without realising it. Our family ranges from a 7 year old through teenagers to grandparents and everyone got something out of it."
15039,4660,5," Kids love it and are constantly asking to play. I think it is a great way for them to learn a few facts about all sorts of subjects. We've now got 7 different boxes!"
15040,4660,4," I bought this as I was very impressed with 'Around the World'. This is much more difficult and my 9 year old won't play it as he finds it too much of a challenge to be fun. Suitable probably for slightly older children."
15041,4660,5," Great to use a starter in the classroom& the kids loved it and made them really think about what they are looking at."
15042,4660,5," Prompt Delivery - Thanks.The Art Cards were very informative.We have ordered a few in this BrainBox series of games and they are sure to give us hours of fun and conversation over the summer holidays.  Thank you very much."
15043,4660,4," A great game to play with lots of interesting info. Children remember most of it but us older ones struggle a little :-) love playing it though ."
15044,4660,5," Great little simple game& take away on holiday - play at home& allows the children to learn facts whilst playing a game."
15045,4661,4," Great for wild kratts fans but expensive for what it is."
15046,4662,5," i got |hawkeye| in the beginning and i then decided to collect the rest of avengers set.just thought that  the ironman legoman was cool looking."
15047,4662,5," This was bought for a friends husbands birthday present. He loved him& put a smile on his face. A must buy for the inner child."
15048,4662,5," Quick delivery and just what I wanted. Thank you."
15049,4663,5," really great for kids to collect. My daugher found it hard to get these figures and get getting doublers which was a waste of money& this way she got the ones she was missing. thanks."
15050,4663,4," Another great idea from LEGO& which has been a real hit with a five-year-old with an active imagination.  Now all we need is a sleigh and some reindeer..."
15051,4663,5," After being promised this by a relative for Xmas and not getting it& we were delighted when it arrived.  Can anyone complain about Lego?"
15052,4663,5," if you are a LEGO fan& minifigures is a great collection for your LEGO set& do not miss it !!"
15053,4663,1," I ordered this product well in advance. It arrived no problem and was then obviously put away for the festive season.Once  opened it was found to be a centurion not Santa and we were all more that an a bit disappointed !!!!. It is the first time in many years of shopping that I have had a problem& have I just been lucky?"
15054,4663,5," Lovely figure& can't fault it& big fan of the mini figures& although it's pricey it's something that can be kept& maybe mounted inside a clear christmas bauble which is lovely for the kids at christmas."
15055,4664,5," This is the 3rd mini figure purchased for my grandson and like all others he adores it."
15056,4664,4," Arrived next day as promised. Very expensive for what it is. Had one very happy boy though."
15057,4665,5," Solid build quality although the accessories are small and fiddly and kid has lost one of them already.  I have now gotten him a storage bag that he keeps all his minecraft figures in and I recommend some sort of storage for these if they are intended for kids. The detail on the items is excellent and any minecraft fan will love the toys.  Personal favourite part of the pack is the slime it looks awesome the way it is designed with the clear surround.  I would go as far as to say these are good enough quality to put on a shelf to do a nice geeky minecraft display."
15058,4665,5," Second Minecraft set purchased (we also have Diamond Steve).  Same great quality.  I purchased as whilst I let my six year old son have 'timed sessions on the XBox/Wii U playing Minecraft' I much prefer him playing on the floor with the figures :)  Would recommend& although my son does have a tendency to remove the figures head and carry around everywhere - Grrr!"
15059,4665,5," These figures are great and love that they keep bringing different ones out& every time I'm out of ideas for gifts they bring a couple more out. Kids love them& great for children& fans or collectors."
15060,4665,5," A must for any minecraft fan! Great to collect!"
15061,4665,5," Bargain just brill super fast delivery xxx"
15062,4665,5," bought for a gift but will love this"
15063,4665,4," If you have a minecraft fan then this is sure to go down well.I wasn't overly impressed with what you get for the money mind but my this is possibly my 6yo favourite toy at the moment. He plays with it constantly and is small enough he can put in pocket and take in the car or wherever we go."
15064,4665,5," my son is 7 loves minecraft but struggles to do the more complex building& mining& etc without me playing... this allows his creative mind to build and play how he wants when i cannot get time to play with him. he now had the full set and has hours of fun"
15065,4666,5," My first Pop! figurine. I love it so much! It's an adorable purchase and fans of Big Hero 6 will love it!"
15066,4666,5," Brilliant product just hope he likes his birthday present.  Really good deliveery service"
15067,4666,5," I got this for my sister for her 18th. She loved it. Would recommend."
15068,4667,4," Very happy with this very easy to transform but I would say the arms are a little sharp."
15069,4667,5," Was shocked to how small This was when arrived but the birthday boy loved it!"
15070,4667,3," Expected a little bigger& was disappointed to find it smaller than expected"
15071,4667,4," This is a nice little transformer. It is very little though but was cheap."
15072,4667,5," Great product for smaller hands and the in-between stage of difficulty"
15073,4667,5," My son loves this& simple but effective& bit on the small side though"
15074,4667,5," Very simple to transform which made a 6 year old very happy."
15075,4668,5," Bought this with another armour for my 7yr old son.  He loved it.  Good quality and arrived quickly.  Thank you :)"
15076,4669,5," It's ever so cute. I can't stop looking at it. It is also a very good and strong key ring. It looks great amongst my Tardis& Dalek and Cyberman key rings. I just wish they did a Clara one because they belong together :)  Buy it. It's cool."
15077,4670,4," My son loved this truck he thought it was amazing and played for ages with it. The only reason i didnt give 5 stars is one of the flaps in the top of the tube snapped off but i think was down to my son as opposed to the toy itself."
15078,4670,5," I didn't love it but my Grandson did& he loves it."
15079,4670,4," Bought for my grandson&  when we finally worked out that the toy didn't need batteries loads of text all of the box& he found it fun to play with"
15080,4670,5," Bought for 9 year old Trashies fan& loads of play value here& even caught 13 year old brother having a play!"
15081,4670,5," Bought for my grandson who loves trashies.Arrived on time with no problems.Very happy with purchase."
15082,4670,5," This was a great addition to my son's collection of trash packs. He absolutely loved the features on the truck and being able to play with it and existing trash packs. My son has handled it quite roughly at times and even packed this truck with us for a trip and it's in perfect condition after suitcase travel& air travel etc. and back& so I would highly recommend this item."
15083,4670,5," My son absolutely loves this and uses it alongside his growing collection of trash packs!"
15084,4670,5," I got it as a present for my 4years old  nephew and month on he still loves it. He goes everywhere with it. The toy is good size& bigger to what i expected to be. Great fun with moving tube-pity it doesn't suck the trashies in automatically but nonetheless great toy."
15085,4671,5," Safely packed and looks so good!"
15086,4672,5," Excellent product.  Just like the character in the game.  Accessories are excellent.  Great value for money. Would definitely recommend"
15087,4672,5," Very pleased with this item."
15088,4673,4," A great gift for a Jack Skellington fan& bit expensive for the price given that it is only a plastic moneybox but my 4 year old who is a huge Jack Skellington fan absolutely adores it so worth every penny to him."
15089,4673,4," Item is good but a little flimsy on the head. Otherwise really very good"
15090,4673,5," Bought as a Christmas present and can't wait to see his face"
15091,4674,5," Very fast delivery..and an excellent character to add to our collection the paint job is perfect for those who are concerned about them being listed on the Internet with imperfect paint jobs ðŸ˜† very happy with product"
15092,4674,5," Great price and arrived very quick. My son was made up."
15093,4674,5," so cute!!!! i love it"
15094,4674,5," Fabulous."
15095,4675,4," Daughter loves it. Great addition with the ponies!"
15096,4676,4," A great figure with excellent detailing and paint apps. The figure sports far superior articulation over some other figures in this wave ie the limited Spartan Locke.On a negative note however& the figure lacks a trigger finger on his hand forcing you to either cut a seperated finger out yourself or modding the rifle if you want him to hold his weapon perfectly.On a second note& the DMR weapon is also rediculously delicate. Any fall of the figure will probably result in the breaking off of the delicate rifle barrel or scope.The figure itself is magnificiently durable& but the weapon is certainly something to be careful of!"
15097,4676,1," The joints are very tight& and when you do try to loosen them they snap& and the pressure I put was minimal. When you pay this much for a figure& you expect better quality."
15098,4676,5," I'm continually impressed at the high quality of this figure& the detail of the features& the paintwork& the articulation - it's exceptional.I keep Spartan Fred on my desk at work& he's in a good pose ready to pull his hand gun from it's holster position on his leg.It's a fantastic figure& especially for the price. I'm so happy with it that I want to buy more of the Halo 5 figures."
15099,4677,5," Top class"
15100,4678,5," As a Pop! Vinyl collector& I'm always a little wary of buying online due to the unpredictable quality of the paint jobs. Thankfully& Elliot arrived in perfect condition (as did his box). Great little figure - love all the small details& and a bargain at less than Â£9!"
15101,4679,5," Its Peppa so the little one loves it. Build quality is adequate given its intended use. We have used it to help her co ordination by getting her to fill the bag and unload it in another part of the house. Now she plays with it as much and sometimes more than her other toys."
15102,4680,5," I bought two other shopping trolleys before this one - the first a plastic ELC one was rubbish - the wheels fell off every two minutes. The second a wire one from Letterbox was so flimsy my 2 year old could bend it with one hand! But this is just brilliant - sturdy& exactly like the real thing with a lovely seat for teddy or doll. The swivel wheels mean its moves freely. My daughter loves it and we take it shopping with us - I have a big trolley and my daughter has hers. The smiles we get from other shoppers and the enjoyment my daughter gets makes shopping a breeze. Way better than any other similar toy and worth the extra expense for the durability. Hours of fun for any toddler."
15103,4680,5," Absolutely fantastic product. My mum bought this for my little boy last Christmas (he was 2yrs old) and he absolutely loves it. A few people said it was an odd gift& but he loves pushing it around. He plays with it loads. As he's got older (he's now 3) he has started imaginative play at home and the trolley comes into its own-we 'go shopping' around the kitchen n living room and fill it with different things.He's taken it to Asda and Sainsburys and the local co-op ande very time we get comments about how fantastic it is. People stop me to ask where I got it from. Absolutely worth the cost& it's a solid structure. Highly recommended for sure."
15104,4680,5," We bought this item based on the good comments its purchase elicited. Our granddaughter is delighted and we are very happy with the robust construction and the little supporting legs for safety.Excellent choice."
15105,4680,5," After my three year old boy went through 3 plastic trolleys. We decided to look for something more sturdy that doesn't breakwithin 5 minutes.  We're very impressed with the above item and it fixed together very securely within 10 minutes. I would highley recommend this metal trolley& if you have a child who likes to play rough."
15106,4680,5," very pleased!!!! i bought this for my two year old daughter for christmas& so took it out of the box to have a look& very cute much better than the plastic ones& i think my daughter will love it& i also think my six year old will enjoy playing with it to."
15107,4680,5," My 5-year old is obsessed with pushing anything with wheels& but particularly the shopping trolley at the supermarket.  This fabulous trolley fits the bill - sturdy and robust and easry enough to put into the boot of the car and take with us.  A complete hit!  The only downside - shoppers stopping to admire the trolley and talk about where it's come from!  Sainsburys/Tesco/Asda - you should be providing these in store!"
15108,4680,4," I bought it for an average size 2 year old and it was much too big for her - she could not reach the handle."
15109,4680,5," Purchased Oct 2015& Reveiwed Dec 2015Purchased this for my 5 year old son who loves to go shopping with me :DI did consider buying this some time ago& but I didn't only because I feared it would be a waste of money... now that we have it& I wish I had bought it sooner. My son loves it& and he loves doing the shopping with it too.It definately makes him happier to be more involved in the big monthly shop (or bi-weekly smaller shopping depending where we go lol).Not that my son was a rascal before& but now he is even more well behaved than before and he loves the attention he gets when using it lol.Now some people will buy this only to be used at home... that's great too if you have a lot of space& but we chose not to do this for this trolley as my son used his previous plastic one at home to store things in.. and we have storage boxes for that purpose :)Anyway& this is very well made and very sturdy indeed.Now upon putting it together I first wondered why the trolley basket doesn't extend all the way to the front of the wheels just like on a full suze trolley& but afterwards I found it to be perfect as it leaves enough space for the parent to put your foot down on it to stop it from moving (like a brake). Which is great for making sure your child doesn't run off pushing the trolley all over the place if you don't want them too :DThe other thing is the actual size of the basket... now it may look a little small in our eyes& but it's a good size for kids to put things in without it getting to heavy (which would also enable the brakes) and believe me& my son knows how to organise his shopping to put the most in it as possible lol.Oh and one last thing....Read more â€º"
15110,4681,5," They fit the bill for my 4 x grandchildren to play with  ages 3years 2year 18months and 12monthsBought as a birthday gift for the youngest and enjoyed by the other 3"
15111,4681,4," Very cute indeed and lovely soft fabric.The only disappointing thing is that the lion's mane is a bit scraggy and the tufts come out easily."
15112,4681,5," I love these....they are pricey but excellent quality.  I'm hoping my boys will enjoy them on the plane trip in December."
15113,4681,5," Really cute finger puppets. Well made and looked fantastic on my jungle flower arrangement. Granddaughter loves them."
15114,4682,2," The product itself is great for pretend play. My 3 yr old loves it& especially the chip and pin card reader. The pretend money is a bit rubbish and there wasn't enough of it. The pretend food was just ok. The tins are not too bad& but the boxes are flimsy and already in my recycling bin.The main problem with this product is the plastic cord that attaches the till to the card reader. The cord is a few feet long and there is no breakaway safety feature.After I found my son with the cord around his neck& I cut the cord off. It's not needed and it serves no purpose. I don't know what Casdon was thinking by adding the cord. I suggest anyone who buys this to cut the plastic cord off ASAP."
15115,4682,5," Good and well made toy for the money& with proper working functions. Play money is US dollars& so recommend the small investment of buying a sterling money set."
15116,4682,4," Our 3 year old son loves this and so from that point of view we can't argue& if he is happy& we are happy.  The till is a nice item and great for playing shops though I'm glad I didn't pay more than I did.  The till has an electronic till sound that rings when ever the till is opened but is so quiet you really have to listen for it.  The chip and pin section was good though only lasted a few weeks and despite checking the batteries& no longer seems to work& I liked the idea that there were two credit cards though each with a different pin number.  The till also has a small roll of paper in it that acts as a receipt though our son gave that a tug and pulled the whole reel out so that didn't last long.  The empty boxes of food items are a nice touch and added to the fun of the item though the money isn't very realistic so we purchased some Sterling play money separately to go with it.  The only reason it gets a 4 rating and not a 3 is because of the sheer play value. Despite its issues it is a great toy and a great learning aid into learning about money."
15117,4682,5," You will have hours of fun with this toy& comes with chip n pin cards with their own numbers& don't put the wrong one in or you can't pay for your shopping! Also make sure you keep a few batteries at hand."
15118,4682,2," Whilst the bright colours means it looks attractive& I am sending it back because it is so small. Maybe it would suit an 18month yo but I don't think it would keep my 4 year old nephew entertained for very long. I think the Pretend Play one is better/more realistic (albeit a bit less bright)."
15119,4682,3," Good fun. Receipt paper very difficult to turn and nothing prints onto it. Working calculator is great.  Overall good value for money."
15120,4682,5," Was quite worried as the box was smaller than expected but the size is fine and it also comes with play money and some food boxes. I'm happy with it."
15121,4682,4," My six year old has had hours upon hours of fun with this toy. It is the most played with toy over the holiday period.Good value and good product.  Educational value also high up there"
15122,4683,5," Bought this finger puppet set for our daughter and she loves it. Our daughter puts the puppets on her fingers and then acts out the story of Cinderella. Really lovely figures and very detailed. Recommended for people who love the story of Cinderella."
15123,4683,5," Got these for my 7 year old daughter. She loved them and loves playing with them. Also got the Wizard of Oz set for my 2year old. She loves hers too. They are well made and my girls interact with each others sets.  Lovely toys that are different from the usual plastic stuff around"
15124,4683,5," Really like this product. It is nicely presented and the characters are well made. Also a nice size for children to play with and not only retell the cinderella story but also engage in lots of role play games."
15125,4683,5," Lovely whimsical characters for my little girls to enjoy telling tales... Well made so no concern of small parts/danger to my three year old."
15126,4684,3," I found this kit delicate to work with and took careful handling to prevent breakages(probably my big fingers ).However& once painted these look good& suit 1/32 to 1/43 scale I think & give a good range of items for the money for any industrial& wartime or farm  diorama. Display rather than play I`d suggest but still representing good value for money for anyone prepared to take the time and care over assembly.For the reasons above I`d say overall 7.5/10"
15127,4684,5," Great little kit. Loads of bits to make up a maintenance area setup.  In fact& probably more than you can utilize& but you cannot quibble over getting too much choice !!  Good quality mouldings and solid pieces. No breakages removing from the sprue."
15128,4684,5," This model of Field Tools is very good and of a high class &I can't wait to do them for my diorama garage."
15129,4684,5," very happy with the italeri 1/35 field tool shop kit 100 per cent feed back from Gareth Lungley"
15130,4684,5," Great model lovely detailing will make addition to my collection"
15131,4685,4," This is a beautifully designed push-up pirate. One of a series from Gisela Graham. The push-up action is smooth and the figure bends very well. The wooden figure feels of good quality. The colours are bright and the pirate has a friendly face. An absolute delight to play with. Try to collect the set!"
15132,4686,5," The tin is brilliant - my husband was disappointed to realise that it only contained play food as the pictures look so appetising.The mini Berliner (jam doughnuts) are a good size for small people... I'm not sure they're helping with the New Year diet resolutions though!"
15133,4687,5," Love these. So much nicer than the standard half dozen box that are everywhere. much more scope for play."
15134,4688,5," Looks alot better up close than it does in the picture. Super fast delivery& thank you"
15135,4688,5," Very good"
15136,4689,5," I find it quite humbling that this Christmas the two run-away most popular toys at my house were this sweet shop and a Penguin Pile Up Game rather than the games consoles and expensive Disney tie-ins which are relentlessly advertised on TV.To start with the sweet shop needs to be constructed& this takes less than a minute and the side and scales just press on& they can then be removed eaily for storage if required. The set comes with some lollipops and a bag of sweets& enough to fill the 2 plastic jars and the trays. It also comes with plastic coins and some paper money. My kids love roleplaying& be it schools& shops& or princesses (bizarrely my 3 year old boy looks great in the dress my daughters put him in) and this shop has given literally hours of entertainment over the last couple of days. To add to the experience I also purchased sweetie bags and some stainless steel tongs for picking up the sweets and dropping them into the bags - these extras cost little over Â£3 and help turn this from a great toy into an awesome one!In a nutshell: The success of a toy has the be measured in play value - and this has not disappointed. Cynics may think that kids would just scoff the sweets& but once the novelty of the sweets wears off they realise that the sweets are an important resource in order for this to work and they manage to keep enough in circulation! Obviously the sweets are easily replaced& I've got a tub of Jelly Babies on stand by."
15137,4689,4," Purchased this for my 4 year daughter who loves sweets and the whole concept of owning her own sweet shop.  Was delivered really fast and unlike one of the reviews I read prior to purchasing this& the two sweet jars do have lids which open and close and therefore are able to be used.  A really good buy and my only complaint was that the lollys provided were slightly sticky!"
15138,4689,5," This shop is great and good value for money.My little girl is like a real shop keeper!It is great for communication skills& numeracy skills and role play."
15139,4689,5," Bought for my 2 year old grand daughter to complete her shop.  Read other reviews and saw that some customers had received item with sweets & whereas others had received shop without .Warned my daughter & in advance &  and she found the sweets tucked away within a separate compartment within the package .Had visions of my grand  daughter having a bean feast before the shop was even set up.My daughter has replaced the sweets with chunky dry pasta shapes and with raisins and dried fruit as dolly mixtures are way too sweet and full of colours.  The shop was well received and the scoop and jars have given lots of fun . The item  has finished off the  shop and added a different dimension to being a shop keeper"
15140,4689,5," I bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter for Christmas and she has been playing with it ever since. She eats some of the goods but loves weighing and putting the other stuff in small bags. I have added my own selection of mini treats too. It is great for role play and a lot of vocabulary is extended and developed too."
15141,4689,3," Good wee toy. Bought for Xmas present. Only criticism would be the scales. Once I had put them together& felt that they were too wobbly - to the extent that the little tray was easily knocked off. So I decided to make an adjustment to the tray& by gluing two pieces of rubber band to the bottom of it& which makes it more stable& when positioned on the scales.  I also bought the pink striped bags and extra tongs."
15142,4689,3," The product information and the reviews lead you to believe that sweets and lollipops are included. They no longer are."
15143,4689,5," brilliant price as the exact same thing in Argos is Â£9& yes you do get the sweets included&ignore the review that said that u dont& they are in a seperate part of the box if you look. fab i bought 4 for stocking fillers& as great value at Â£4&99 and free delivery& brilliant kids will love em"
15144,4690,5," My children love these finger puppets and they are really nicely made& full of detail and really appealing.  This set proved to be so popular that we have invested in more sets and we now enjoy lots for storytelling antics and have been invited to watch some fabulous puppet shows!  The finger puppets can be used by children and adults and are a lovely way to involve young children in storytelling ~ they love to join in! The puppets also have little velcro hooks on the back of them so that they stick to fabric ~ I purchased a lovely felt story book to go with the finger puppets and it has been a great hit with the children.  I cannot recommend these puppets enough& they are such good quality which is why I have been back and bought other sets and I will be buying more."
15145,4691,5," Very pleased with this - there's a great amount of detail in the design and it's a well thought our product. Lots for little people to learn and great fun with the scanner& microphone& card payment machine& cash register& and so on. An instant hit with the 2yo it was purchased for - even up against some other fantastic and engaging birthday presents. The coins are small so something to be aware of& but everything else seems a decent/safe size.Only two very small niggles:1. The cable on the scanner is very short so not always very convenient for scanning.2. The whole unit is very light which means pushing the cash tray back in really requires two hands - one to push and one to hold the rest of the unit in place."
15146,4691,5," this has created so much fun for my grand children. creates imagination& social and money skills. highly recommended for all budding shop keepers."
15147,4691,5," My 5 yea old loves this till.  it has everything a little girl needs when she is an important shop keeper."
15148,4691,5," My daughter loves this toy it is one of her favourites for Christmas she loves the tannoy its very grown up.my daughter is 4. Overall I would definitely recommend!"
15149,4691,5," Amazing till. It has all the features your child could want. My 3yr old loved this for her birthday. Lots of pay money& everything makes sounds and lights up realistically. Till display adds up properly and a tannoy system too. Highly recommend"
15150,4691,4," I bought this cash register for my grandaughter's third birthday.She was delighted with it.  Just the right size for little fingers.  Very sturdy and well made she couldn't wait to start playing with it."
15151,4691,5," Brilliant toy& gets played with a LOT and has stood up to lots of |sharing|"
15152,4691,5," My 2yr old niece seems to love playing with this.  Nothing negative comes to mind."
15153,4692,4," At only Â£2 these finger puppets were a great buy! My 12 week old loves them and we have lots of song/play time using them. We started using from 4 weeks to help her track objects and focus and now at 12 weeks she really responds to them with smiles and is trying to grab each one. The finger puppets are well made and are colourful and eye catching. The elasticated bit inside the puppet that wraps round your finger can be a little tight if worn for a while and can make your finger a little numb but song time never goes on that long anyway. For the money it's a great little addition to the toys to keep my daughter amused!"
15154,4692,5," I bought these with trepidation& (very cheap& China) but I was very wrong& this is a fab little set and so very worth the money& the pieces are nicely made with no pulls or stitching errors anywhere.The set includes 10 different animals which can be used as finger puppets on both caregiver or child (though those with very large fingertips may struggle) and has a nice mix of domestic (dog& rabbit)& countryside (duck& cow& mouse& frog) and 'wild' animals (hippo& bear& panda& elephant) so you can do a variety of stories or songs. My nearly 2 year old went mad when she saw them and likes to carry them around making the noises and putting them with her happyland figures so they certainly have play value outside of finger puppets too."
15155,4692,4," Cute little finger puppets& finger holes a little small but other than that quite nice. Not sure how long they will last for but they do a job and my baby loves them."
15156,4692,5," These are so sweet and such good value -lots of hours of fun with these. Exactly as pictured too x"
15157,4692,1," Brought these for my children they're not the best quality and the eyes fell off straight away"
15158,4692,1," Don't buy these for babies - the eyes fall off which is a choking nightmare"
15159,4692,5," Purchased these for my toddler.-Amazing price for the number of puppets-perfect size for small fingers& most adults may find them too small-decent quality for the price& none have broken and it has been over 6 months-prompt shippingAl in all would definitely recommend."
15160,4692,4," Some of these are a bit warped but for Â£1.67 odd certainly worth it for 17 pence a puppet. Some elastic which holds the puppet to the finger was stretched which means it was useless as puppets but the wee 5years old i gave them to as a gift didn't seem too bothered...but she did notice lol."
15161,4693,5," Fab item"
15162,4694,5," puppets to go with the theatre orer very goodbut I attatched the small finger puppets to ends of wooden spoons which made it easy for grandchildr(age 3"
15163,4694,5," I bought this toy for teaching purposes and the children have enjoyed retelling the story using the puppets. Great that the wolfs mouth moves."
15164,4694,5," This was a birthday present for my grandson. He loves it. Puppets (and the theatre/shop also produced by Tellatale) are well made& bright and colourful. An excellent toy and would recommend it."
15165,4694,4," Hi& I am a childminder and the puppets I bought (three little pigs and snow white andthe seven dwarfs) were a great success with the children. I would definately buymore in the future."
15166,4694,4," My niece is 2 years old and loved itThe wolf has a very funny face and the little pigs are just sweet.The packaging could be better& (just a plastic bag) but is the inside that matters.The pigs are very small and is difficult to keep them steady in your finger."
15167,4694,4," The puppets are made from good quality material. The three little pigs are very small& just finger puppets but he children at playgroup liked handling them and carrying them round in collections of other things."
15168,4694,4," my son loved this only down side was the wolf head and lil pigs were a bit small for our hands so found role play with our son a lil annoying but overall he loved it so that's all that matters"
15169,4694,4," Hard if not near impossible to move the head of the wolf& as well as the arms... but looks like a quality item& well made and you can tell it will be popular with the kids.  Pigs are difficult to fit into the pouch at the back of the wolf!  Pigs are very cute."
15170,4695,4," just the right size and good quality! my daughter loves it. I bought the lot of accessories from other companies to it than Hape and it works great. The assembly& however& was a bit confusing. The boards do not have the same distance to the legs on the sides. I could not understand why. But it is not visible. Nothing you think about afterwards& but it was really a question mark in the assembly."
15171,4695,4," Excellent delighted with our purchase"
15172,4696,5," Sent as gift shipping was much earlier than promised. They absolutely love it. Her  18 month daughter plays with them all the time. Age appropriate and safe"
15173,4697,5," The market stand is a lovely quality toy. We bought it to extend role play possibilities at home. We have a cooker and lots of food and this now enables my little one to go shopping& choose food at the market& create shopping lists& understand number& weight and introduce money. The possibilities are endless! We will have hours of fun every day!"
15174,4697,5," This is a simple but effective toy. Well constructed and simple to put together. Multi purpose in that it functions as a market toy for shopping play& and a stand& series of shelves for any other activity.Excellent value."
15175,4697,5," For the price& this can't be beaten. Would be nice if you could buy extra crates as we have a lot of fruit"
15176,4697,5," Excellent quality&I was very impressed. I got my husband to put it together though&it took him about half an hour."
15177,4697,5," Our three year old son wants to be a farmer at the moment and is very into his tractors etc.  We started buying the wooden fruits and vegetables which he would load into his tractor trailer and make some pocket money selling it to friends"
15178,4697,5," ive bought this for a candy stall for my sons wedding as hiring something similar was over Â£200 and we get to keep it when the weddings over. A piece was broken but was very promptly replaced and were delighted. The money saved has allowed us to buy lots of extras to make the Candy stall very special . My Great niece gets a brilliant solid toy after the wedding its a win win situation. Very beautifully crafted and idiot prof to make up took 20 minutes from start to finish."
15179,4697,5," Super toy& very well constructed and Excellant quality"
15180,4698,5," not expecting much for the price& but was pleasantly surprised& good quality plastic& and very useable...extremely"
15181,4698,5," just the job for my granddaughter to keep her spending money in - good buy and very quick delivery"
15182,4698,5," Lovely purse for my granddaughter sure she'll love it."
15183,4699,5," The 3rd set of puppets I have bought for the grandchildren. Absolutely delightful& a live story"
15184,4699,5," Fantastic item& I have nearly all of the sets now for my grandson.  It really brings stories to life for young children."
15185,4699,5," A great pack: easy to use and the bag is excellent for storage. My grandchildren are delighted with their new 'friends'."
15186,4699,5," Fabulous resources to stimulate and engage children in the world of make believe and story telling. Adults  and children alike will love these puppets. Because they are quite small they are ideal for being operated by small children rather than full hand puppets that my 5 year old still struggles to manipulate really well."
15187,4700,5," Amazing educational gift for my 7 yrs daughter at her birthday. all her cousins loved it as well"
15188,4700,5," lovely chunky good quality"
15189,4700,5," Yes really good thankyou"
15190,4701,5," Cute little Characters& quite well made making allowances for difficulties in making very small items. As Can be seen by picture Santa's coat is a bit short- I would worry about his modesty so will make a longer jacket.  On the whole I would recommend for interactive play with tots but not for leaving small child alone with as noses etc not secure enough."
15191,4701,1," They looked nice and cute till the seams started breaking within a couple of days!"
15192,4701,3," not that good not well made&&& looks nothing like the picture&&&my grandson was disappointedhe did not know what they were  look nothing like the animal there where suppose to  look like"
15193,4701,1," Really poor quality& I brought these for party bag fillers. They have gone in the bin...wouldn't recommend these. Some of the finger puppets look they have been used before"
15194,4701,1," Three of the toys had eyes missing and fluff coming out. These were purchased for entertaining my baby but not safe for children. Cheap price and cheap quality"
15195,4701,4," Ordered two packs as advent calendar fillers.  Look really cute. Quite tight/small  as a finger puppet but will be fine for my 2"
15196,4701,5," These little finger puppets are amazingly good quality for the price.  They are brightly coloured& detailed and characterful& just as they appear on the picture. I expect their individual faces will vary from batch to batch but my penguin has a slightly sinister look& Father Christmas looks rather self-satisfied& the snowman and teddy have an air of innocence and poor Rudolph seems a bit down on his luck with a 'roadkill' look about him. Great fun and the funny expressions will be all the better for story telling."
15197,4701,3," More for kids to use than for adults to play with children as they are small& good value  and good fun"
15198,4702,5," We like cooking in this. It's not big enough for a proper stew. But works with a couple of small sausages... And again great for small fingers to manage. Bought when the price had dropped so also pleased it was a bargain."
15199,4703,4," Kids loved Mickey and Minnie as a Valentine's gift. The movement is limited as a push puppet. The Brio dog moves better. But still very sweet figures and well made. Vendor shipped fast and well packed for coming overseas."
15200,4703,4," This product is cute I just have to decided whether to put it in my daughters stocking filler or wrap for her birthday. I was hoping that we would recieve the pink 1 but she loves Mickey too so shel be happy with it."
15201,4703,5," Grandchildren& (2 - 7yrs in age)& all loved them.Seem sturdy and well made."
15202,4704,5," Great for little hands"
15203,4705,5," Perfect for 2 year old.  Seems strong enough to take the battering it will get"
15204,4706,5," I loved it"
15205,4707,4," I thought this would be bigger!  Seems well made though I'm sure son will love having his own trolley when at the supermarket :-)"
15206,4707,5," Purchased for our son for christmas as he had a plastic one which did not last long& the first one didnt arrive but the second did and he loves it.  Seems sturdy and well built& so thumbs up"
15207,4707,4," My boys love it although it is easily bent if bashed about as my boys do a little they love going to supermarket with me and taking their own trolley!"
15208,4707,5," My son will love this at xmas"
15209,4708,4," Christmas present for my granddaughter who is loves Barbie& she will love it but I can't really comment."
15210,4708,5," Really good for children under 7 and stationary"
15211,4708,3," Ordered two but only got one. Have two granddaughters so could not give to one without the other. Still in drawer and will give for a birthday instead. Delivery and packed well."
15212,4708,4," Recipient seemed pleased."
15213,4708,5," Child absolutely love it"
15214,4709,4," I'm a music therapist and I bought this and have started to use it with some of the special needs kids I work with. Plus-es are that it's portable& and everything is attached which means that you don't suddenly find yourself without that all important sheep that your ASD client has decided to fixate upon. However& I've found that I don't get as good a response from some of the kids when using the puppet than when using individual finger-puppets. Some of the more lower-functioning kids seem to find it more difficult to connect with the images on each finger of this puppet compared with the more 3-D finger puppet images that they can take and hold in their hands. However& this is a good quality product& which is easy and versatile to use."
15215,4709,5," Another great hand puppet to add to our collection. Nice bright colours and fun for both my baby and toddler."
15216,4709,5," My niece is 3 mths old and loves this toy. she giggles and coo's every time we play with her with this. This finger puppet glove and song book realy is ideal for babys to toddlers. FUN FUN FUN giggle."
15217,4709,5," Love this and more importantly so does my granddaughter& although i do find  Old Macdonald in lots of strange places including the cupboards!"
15218,4710,4," I bought two of these dinosaur glove puppets to use while reading 'A Lovely Love Story' by Edward Monkton. They were perfect. They were intended for fun rather than educational value but you could use them for all sorts of learning play.The glove puppets use all your digits - 4 fingers and thumb - which works brilliantly and means you can make the puppets do lots of actions and expressions. The fit might be a bit on the large side for a child to use but was just right for an adult. Also the seller might want to change the tag position - it was difficult to remove from the dinosaur heads.They were brand new and good quality& the best value I found on the net& and arrived quickly. Overall a good buy and lots of fun!"
15219,4711,4," Wild republic brand...for some reason their website does not advertise this hand puppet tiger andits really difficult to get in touch with them and to find the searched items. Amazon was a really great help here& thanks.It looks like on the picture& I had one previously as a present which was the same brand but looked different& anyway...its a fun present :)"
15220,4712,5," Well made and good quality item& sent to Japan as a teaching aid.Would recommend"
15221,4712,5,""
15222,4712,5," Loved it! Great quality - my class of Year 6s adored using William whilst studying Macbeth."
15223,4713,5," Beautifully made and perfect size - nice and large& great for adult hands.  And very good value.  My children love this puppet and all the others I have in this range. (In a perfect world& I think I would prefer these puppets to have round& rather than flat heads& and I'd prefer to be able to manipulate the mouth& as one can with most or all of the Puppet Company's animal puppets"
15224,4713,5," Well made!"
15225,4714,5," Great fun and quality toy"
15226,4715,5," Beautiful !!! Love it  !!!"
15227,4716,5," I've been very impressed with the quality of this range of puppets - which is not conveyed by the photos. They are very well made from a very thick and high quality plush fabric.Although targetted at children they can also be used by adults - my hand is 19cm long and I can use it comfortably with a thumb and finger inserted into the paws and another two fingers working the mouth.This glove puppet range by The Puppet Company will not disappoint an adult or child looking to have a bit of fun!"
15228,4716,5," soft& lovely toy& I bought two for my 4 and 8 yo nieces and they absolutely love it!"
15229,4716,5," We have bought several glove puppets frpm this company.All very well constructed and durable.not for kids. But as toys to play with our non-destructive German Shepherd.she loves them. Excellent teeth cleanner and very washable.the seller is missing a marketing opportubity here :-)"
15230,4716,5," delivered promptly& in excellent condition& good quality. I've had a lot of fun with this& - bizarrely enough I have used it at work& with adults& rather than with little children& and it has gone down really well& and generated a lot of interest. This was a good investment"
15231,4716,5," A great well made puppet.  My daughter was very happy with the purchase.  He is her new best (toy) friend!He's been everywhere with us recently.  I'd definitely recommend this toy and would definitely by from products made by the Puppet Co again."
15232,4716,5," I bought this puppet for school and the children love it.  Very good quality and detail& it has been in constant use since I bought it& durable and excellent value for money.  Overall a great purchase."
15233,4716,5," Bought this fox puppet for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it and can't stop playing with it. Good quality and soft."
15234,4716,5," Beautifully made puppet& my grandson loves it. Had it a while now and it still has to come out every time he visits."
15235,4717,3," Loved this toy just as it is in the picture and my baby likes it too.took awhile to come back but given as it was coming from so far I was expecting that."
15236,4717,5," Baby loves it. The small toys choking risk wasn't given to baby same with wooden toy wasn't given to child choking risk"
15237,4717,3," Seems to be nice enough. But was not expecting it to come from China and have to wait such a long time. Also"
15238,4717,5," Lovely item.Soft and colourful. Baby cant take her eyes off it! Very entertaining. Thank you very much for quick delivery"
15239,4717,5," I bought this as a gift& it felt soft& has a gentle rattle"
15240,4717,4," Incredibly soft but not adjustable Velcro so might not fit her wrist for a while. Lovely bright colours"
15241,4717,1," Very disapointed item lasted less than 24 hours. Stitching all came away and will not be buying again"
15242,4717,5," My granson loves these - especially the label.  Savies having to pick up toys when out and about."
15243,4718,5," Kids really loved this. Lots of fun. Well made"
15244,4719,4," I've been very impressed with the quality of these puppets - which is not conveyed by the photos. They are very well made from a very thick and high quality plush fabric and unlike the glove puppets in the range& these are partly stuffed so will sit& stand or pose like a soft& cuddly toy.This rat puppet is surprisingly life-like and& if you're not a great lover of rats& it could also be a little creepy. The tail is quite realistic from a distance - so be warned!!Having said that& it is fun to bring to life. It can wash itself& groom and& if you have good finger dexterity in operating its very tiny mouth& it can 'speak'.These puppets are predominantly targeted at children but they can also be used by adults with small hands. My hand is 19cm long and it's a very tight squeeze to say the least but I can just about operate its paws and mouth simultaneously.The mouth is very small so if you're specifically looking for a puppet to 'speak' then it would be better to seek one with a larger mouth but if you just need it to 'act' like a live rat& then it will not disappoint an adult or child looking to have a bit of light-hearted fun!"
15245,4719,5," This rat (now formally know as Atouille)& is absolutely brilliant and is looking forward to appearing in the Ghost Walks of Pontefract Castle in the autumn. Full of character and so easy to manoeuvre& he is definitely destined for stardom."
15246,4719,5," Fantastic Rat! I bought for a team mascot where I work& also my 1 year old daughter loves it. Good quality for the price."
15247,4720,5," Beautifully made hand puppets& only problem was the product description........suppose to come with an authentic water pistol instead they come with a magic wand I was a bit dissappointed  to say the least. AMAZON get your product descriptions correct please!!!!"
15248,4720,5," Excellent product& Sweep's squeak could be a bit more authentic but Grandchildren love them !"
15249,4720,5," I had these when I was a little girl and being pregnant with my first baby I just couldn't resist getting them for her. Absolutely perfect& love them."
15250,4720,5," The item was lost in transit and it appeared that our great granddaughter was not going to get it for her 6th birthday.However& I got in touch with Amazon and explained the situation and they pulled out all the stops at short notice and a replacement item arrived in the nick of time.Thank you very much Amazon"
15251,4720,5," I loved Sooty as a child and was very excited when these puppets arrived - my children were too! The fabric is very soft and cuddly. Sooty has a wand (the one I had as a child never did!) and Sweep squeaks! My children are 5 and 3& and they have great fun playing with them. They love them and so do I!"
15252,4720,3," Product is a laugh and pretty good quality.Only two faults are:Sweep's squeak is weak and to use it you have to sacrifice two finders with the consequence of not being able to control both his hands.Sooty's wand is in an odd position and is permanently attached. A detached wand with a Velcro hand would probably have been a better idea though I acknowledge this would put the cost up.Overall though& would recommend for a laugh."
15253,4720,5," These are great! Have bought 2 sets as Christmas gifts& so they're still in the packaging at the moment - but really good sized puppets and they bring a real touch of nostalgia when you're looking at them!Am happy I've finally got Sooty and Sweep in my house& albeit for the short time before I give them to 2 lovely little ones - might have to buy a 3rd set for myself!"
15254,4720,4," Nice items and kids love them& sweep best cos he has a squeekie. Whilst the puppets are a good size externally& they are quite small inside so only a smallish/medium hand will fit properly. Which is a real shame and a poor oversight. Also Sooty's wand is sown on and so doesnt move properly. It would have been better to velcro it so you could use it on sooty and sweep."
15255,4721,4," Chopper is a lovely shark& my little girl really likes him a lot. He is well made& soft almost velvety feeling material and the teeth are soft enough that a nip from him wont hurt. Chopper feels comfy on your hand and its easy to get the shark to do as you please (singing& playing with toys& biting toes). Ultimately he is as good as your imagination lets him be& the quality wont let you down. I'll be buying another for my nephew too."
15256,4721,5," My son adores sharks and this has been a hit. Good quality& fun to play with. A great present for a shark fanatic."
15257,4721,5," I'm an ESOL teacher for young learners. This puppet really got my students laughing and opening up to speaking. It's one of the first activities they want to do! Great!!"
15258,4721,5," The first thing I noticed when I received the puppet was the quality of the construction. The back has a velvety texture which gives it an authentic 'fishy' look. Also& the teeth are great& big and pointy but without being sharp so small children don't mind being 'chomped' by it.It has real character and is now a firm favourite with the kids.I am now very tempted by the others in the range (especially the t-rex!)"
15259,4721,5," We have had this toy for a few months now and my dog& Jack& absolutely loves the shark toy. I pop it on my hand and it chases Jack and bites his tail. Then Jack turns around and they battle away in a fun way with Jack's tail wagging furiously. Then Jack rolls over and shark gives Jack a massage and rubs his tummy. Great fun. Well made. Strong and has not ripped at all."
15260,4721,5," Bought this for a 3-year old.  She loves it to bits.  Plenty of chatter and play.. but be aware& the grown-ups will have to participate as well.It is well made& sturdy and the fabric is of a very good quality.  No loose fluffy fur to comb out for fear of choking or breathed in.  washable and comes out good as new.  Would recommend this any time."
15261,4721,5," Bright fabric& big enough for adult to use with children and also padded enough for it to fit a small child's hand. The teeth are hard plastic which give it a great look and feel for children when you snap the mouth for them. Happy with size& quality and look for price. Thinking of getting another."
15262,4721,5," This puppet is great - it was well wrapped and arrived very quickly. The material is of high quality and the puppet is made to allow for you to move the jaws wide open which works well for a shark. I used it as a class puppet with the book |D|on't eat the teacher| and it worked well."
15263,4722,5," Excellent quality& no child could possible resist this puppet. Would recommend to any buyers looking for a puppet with instant appeal"
15264,4722,5," Small hand held duck for me son who loves it."
15265,4723,5," This is a present for a four year old& a 62 year old had great fun trying it out.  Well made and what fun."
15266,4723,5," Bought as a gift for a four year old.  Very nice looking puppet& just the right size for the recipient.  His sword is removable and he looks well made.  Just what I hoped for.  Ordered on 16 Dec for Jan birthday in anticipation of Christmas delays but arrived on 19 Dec.....very impressed."
15267,4723,5," Purchased this for my grandaughter& she likes to make up stories and along with a few other puppets this is one of her favourites& well made and easy for her to use. Would recommend this item."
15268,4723,5," amazing puppet& well done. I love this product& nice texture. My children loved the puppets show which I ve done for them."
15269,4724,5," This puppet is excellent value for money& but& the puppet's arm& the one  which holds the banana& cannot be manipulated sufficiently (internally) to enable the held banana to be placed into the chimp's mouth.  My 11 year old grand daughter loves her chimp - I would definitely recommend this item."
15270,4724,4," I thought the puppet was fantastic. It is a great size& very easy to use& and quite cute looking. Only downside was that it was quite heavy to use for a long time& and quite hot for your hand.Customer service was great& as I request my delivery to be sent by a specific date& and they were very attentive to my needs."
15271,4724,5," I was looking for a professional looking puppet& to perform a comedy stage routine. Having looked over various sights& I finally found this one. The service was brilliant& the quality of the product is first class& and even taking it out of the parcel& my colleuges were in fits of laughter. all in all a brilliant buy."
15272,4724,5," Bought this for my other half after watching Nina Conti and he wanted a puppet. It's a great size with velcro on his hands so he can even give you a hug!This would be great for all ages& maybe not toddlers as it's quite large. Overall& really lovely puppet"
15273,4724,5," This item has been a fantastic buy. I am a student at uni and I am using it for a project and it is providing so much entertainment not just to the people I am working with but my entire house! It is so cute and looks so happy. I recommend it to anyone. Such a lovely toy. My only negatives would be that the arms don't do very much as you cannot manoeuvre them and the mouth is not quite as expressive as I would like& other than that its lovely."
15274,4724,4," Bought for schools health promotion programme. Great attention getter and fun to useBanana needs velcro to stick. Otherwise excellent product and great value for money"
15275,4724,5," I always wanted a puppet like this& I purchased it for myself as a birthday gift from my wife. She hates it& I love it. These days I always buy what I want for a birthday gift and then give it to my wife or children to wrap for me. Great fun& buy it& your kids will love it& but your wife may not."
15276,4724,5," This large primate puppet has provided hours of entertainment. His hands attach to each other by velcro (there's even velcro on his banana so you can take the peel off it!)His fur comes away quite easily but generally he's been very durable. Excellent gift ideal for children or big kids!!"
15277,4725,5," These are lovely& well-made and very high quality puppets.  The main body is a very thick& long-'fur' fabric (which can shed a little in its first few uses) and the feet and beak are made from brushed nylon.This large-size (approx 40cm long excluding tail) puppet can be used by young children& teenagers or even adults.  I have large hands and long arms but still find them comfortable to use.  The large beak is very easy to operate and& unlike some other puppets which force the operator to move both the upper and lower beak/jaw& it is easy and comfortable to move only the lower beak.  This is a much more natural and realistic movement than raising the upper beak for the bird to 'speak' or squawk.  The squawker inside the mouth is surprisingly loud and makes a fairly realistic bird-squawk sound rather than a typical squeaker-squeak.  It can also be removed& if preferred.I use these puppets to make entertainment videos for a mostly adult audience& including a special needs group of adults.  I've found that adults with a sense of humour seem to appreciate them just as much as children of all ages from toddlers to pre-teens.  They're very versatile& great fun and I think they offer exceptional value for money considering their quality.  I have nearly the full range of these birds and I generally operate them in pairs with them interacting together for performances.A very good buy and great fun too& limited only by your own or your child's creativity and imagination."
15278,4725,5," This puppet is absolutely hilarious.The pets hate it but us people have great fun either scaring people with it or just playing silly puppet games. Excellent around children."
15279,4725,5," Bought this for my one year old granddaughter& knowing that her big sisters& aged 3 and 7& would enjoy playing with it.  Success all round.  Lovely and soft.  The squeaker inside the beak was a surprise but can be bypassed if necessary!"
15280,4725,5," I use this at school and nursery with children who find spoken communication hard. They love it and it gives them confidence to speak"
15281,4726,5," I've been very impressed with the quality of this range of puppets - which is not conveyed by the photos. They are very well made from a very thick and high quality plush fabric and are surprisingly life-like and this one has a slightly longer pile 'fur' than the rest of the range.Although targetted at children they can also be used by adults - my hand is 19cm long and I can use it comfortably with fingers inserted into the front paws and another two to operate the mouth. The mouth is quite small so if you're looking for a puppet to 'speak' then it would be better to seek one with a larger mouth such as Large Rabbit Tellatale Puppet but this range by The Puppet Company will not disappoint an adult or child looking to have a bit of fun!This puppet comes in two versions - a standard glove puppet and this long-sleeve version which I feel is better suited to adults or for using in a puppet-theatre type setting."
15282,4726,4," Went with us to the USA to play a joke on 'family'& with other puppets to hunt in the backwoods while wearing coon skin hats& the Davy Sprocket thing?.No animals were hurt in this hunt but puppets lost."
15283,4726,5," I was very pleased with the quality of this bunny. It has long fur and a soft tummy and if you are 7 years old what more could you ask for?"
15284,4726,5," I bought this for my Bengal cat as she likes to attack my arm (its a game we play)& this adds protection and extra fun& she loves it!"
15285,4727,5," My 7 yr old absolutely loves this toy& images of Rod Hull and Emu come to my mind when I see him play with it! Well made& and it's a substantial toy for the price. Great for imaginative play& and all the kids that come into our house are drawn to our collection of puppets!"
15286,4727,5," My children absolutely love Emu& he has got a real character& and they enjoy assuming this alter-ego when they play!  My kids are 7& 9 and 11& and they all want to control Emu!!!  Great for mischief and imagination!"
15287,4727,5," we bought the emu for our 6 month old baby and she loves it.  As soon as we bring it out she starts giggling uncontrollably and gets so excited she shakes.  We obviously control it& squeaking it and making it move about but hopefully as she gets older she'll enjoy playing with it properly"
15288,4727,5," Got this as a novelty present for my younger brother who had the original emu puppet from the 70'sReally good quality and Emu has already established himself as head of the household (4 shoes removed and 1 severe pecking administered)"
15289,4727,5," This was purchased as a Christmas gift for our four& soon to be five year old son.  He and his friends have had such an enormous amount of fun with it.  Even though none of them have ever seen the real Emu with Rod Hull they all seem to get the idea straight away of a mischievous bird acting out as if they were on the Michael Parkinson show.  A lot of fun for everyone."
15290,4727,5," Fantastic - we have mad some wonderful evenings in our local club using the puppet. Would really recommend this puppet to young and old"
15291,4727,5," My daughter is nine years old and I was unsure if she would like the emu however& she loves it. We have had lots of fun with it and she has become very protective of it !! I would recommend the emu."
15292,4727,5," Grreat - drove grandkids parents mad ...."
15293,4728,5," This is a fun puppet for a child from about age 5 to a young-at-heart adult.Like all Puppet Company puppets& the monster is well-made from quality fabrics ie thick plush polyester 'fur' and child-safe eyes.  Although probably intended as a child's toy& the puppet is also suitable for use by an adult& eg to amuse and entertain a child or in a performance.  One of the most appealing features is the opening mouth which is workable and opens to create various facial expressions and help with expressing emotion.  On opening wide& the monster can be made to smile broadly which can be quite a surprise if the mouth has been kept shut for the earlier part of his performance.  The mouth is also fitted with a loud 'squeaker' which I personally would find quite annoying so it was instantlly removed with a quick snip.A recommended and value-for-money purchase for anyone& either child or adult& who enjoys playing with puppets."
15294,4728,4," The puppet does look better when you recieve it. The face is really funny and I believe it will be found amusing by people of different ages. also i hadnt realised when i had bought it that it squeaked when you moved its mouth& so it wouldnt be ideal for like a ventriloquist thing.Overall the puppet looks great& and my friend who is a keen fan of 'Avenue Q' loved it."
15295,4728,5," These monster puppets by the puppet company are like dear friends to your children.  They are so expressive and cuddly& my children all sleep with theirs.  Very well built& definitely worth the money.  The blue and green one is long and thin and I have seen this one with different 'hairstyles'.  He's got great eyes& a very energetic character& but the best thing about these is that you make the puppet personal with your own interaction.  Really lovely gift for a child."
15296,4728,5," Great product& was delivered quickly. Although this is going to be an xmas pressie I brought it out to check and was very pleasantly surprised. When you open and close his mouth he squeaks. He is made of very hairy fabric& so no good if you have very small children& but looks suitably |monster| like for my four year old! I imagine he will have a lot of use popping up from behind doors and sofas to |scare| us all. Hes easy to use and I think we'll have a lot of fun with him. (I think it's a |he|!) Would recommend."
15297,4728,5," Very fun and cuddly product& our 6 year old son got one for Christmas and we bought this for his younger 4 year old brother and they both have fun squeaking them together.  One is called Squeaker and the other is called Fred.  Lots of fun had by all."
15298,4729,5," Great puppet"
15299,4730,5," This item was bought to complete the set of Sooty Sweet and Soo for our Granddaughters very good quality recommend the buy. TH Leicester"
15300,4730,5," Soo is great& and my grandchildren (7 and 3) have got quite into Sooty& Sweep and Soo & staging little performances etc.Nice unsophisticated fun - thank you!"
15301,4730,4," Only reservation I have& like other reviewers have previously said& the space for your hand is a bit limited& but on the whole a success with the little ones."
15302,4730,4," Not as good as Sweep :) it had quite a few loose threads on the skirt& easy enough to remove with some scissors of course& but that costs it a star from me."
15303,4731,5," These are well-made& good quality& durable puppet toys made from quality materials in bright colours with appealing& cheerful designs and facial expressions.  They can easily be animated and brought to life by any child or adult with a playful side and some imagination.  Their mouths are easy to work& especially for an adult who will also have the finger strength and dexterity to squeeze the small squeaker in the puppet's tongue.These puppets are not just for children - I'm a mature (well& perhaps that is questionable...) adult with long arms and large hands and I find the puppets a perfect size for my arm and hand and very easy to operate.They'll provide ongoing fun and amusement limited only by the user's imagination. I like to use a pair or trio of puppets to interact and perform together and the bright colours and jaunty facial expressions of the characters within the range complement each other well (see my uploaded photos).A great buy and fantastic value for money too!"
15304,4731,4," This puppet is awesome!I bought it to use with children and they love it! The very young ones (3-4) were a little scared at first& but after I told them that monster was scared of children they were clamouring to make friends with it.I gave durability 3/5 on account of the orange fluff comes off on all my clothes& which is a irratiting. Other then that I have no issues."
15305,4731,5," I purchased this toy for a friends son who is 6& before receiving it was worried it may be a liitle too young for him despite him loving puppets.  It has arrived and I'm that impressed I have ordered 2 more for my own children! A great way to use their imagination and good quality.  Love it!  Arrived earlier than expected too one of my favourite purchases recently thanks!The Puppet Company Ginger Sockette Long Sleeved Hand Puppet"
15306,4731,5," This puppet is even more beautiful than described! It came very quickly& and seems really durable. The fabrics are very soft and tactile& I know my students are going to love him! Thank you."
15307,4732,5," Beautifully made and perfect size - nice and large& great for adult hands.  And very good value.  My children love this puppet and all the others I have in this range. (In a perfect world& I think I would prefer these puppets to have round& rather than flat heads& and I'd prefer to be able to manipulate the mouth& as one can with most or all of the Puppet Company's animal puppets"
15308,4732,5," Great"
15309,4733,4," My little sister wanted one of these for christmas. I thought it was a bit pricey for a blanket but bought it anyway. However& it is very thin and not very big& It is a nice product however it is a bit expensive for what it is."
15310,4733,5," this is a very well made item& its a great addition to car journeys as its a little pillow also& our four children have a different on e each and provides hours of fun ... excellent unusual gift"
15311,4733,5," I bought this for my 11 year old niece and she loves it& a great toy both for puppeteering and for cuddling up with when she's sleepy."
15312,4733,5," my grandaughter loves it great buy&its not only a blanket but a cuddly toy to&would recommend it to all children"
15313,4733,5," There were screams of delight when this was unwrapped by my 4 year old Granddaughter and she immediately snuggled up on the sofa with this wrapped around her.  Obviously a great hit.  She also loves her snuggle pet cuddly cushion/pillows which are steadily growing in number!"
15314,4733,5," I have only has a quick check of the snuggle cuddluppets unicorn as it is a Christmas present for my horse mad Granddaughter who will love it.This has been my first purchase from Amazon and I must say how pleased I have been with service and delivery."
15315,4733,3," Nice product& a lot smaller than I thought but measurements were advertised. My daughter will love it because it is a unicorn otherwise she would probably put in the corner and forget about it. Slightly overpriced for what it is."
15316,4733,5," Another gift for the granddaughter& who actually requested it.  She's aged 7 and has it draped about herself constantly.  It's like a grown up comfort blanket.  It isn't too big which makes it easy to carry about."
15317,4734,5," Our grandson's favourite animal& so he has one at his house and another one 90 miles away in Wales with us!  He thinks it's magic!!"
15318,4735,5," Mr Cinnamon is the newest member of our household& and is already much loved.He's no mere puppet& his expressive face gives him a whole life of his own.There's no end to the enjoyment such a well made puppet can bring to anyone (maybe not Campbell Smith Ins |Willie Smith|). Mr Cinnamon wins hands down over the Scarlet Macaw Glove Puppet. BLAM."
15319,4735,5," I bought this for my son to go with the horse puppet& I eventually want to get a collection to make storytime more fun and to build his imagination when he is a bit bigger. These puppets are very nice quality and pretty good value for money. The same ones cost an arm and a leg in Italy& like everything else for kids. The only downside I have is that the face is a bit freaky and his 'jazz hands' get in the way a bit so he always has to do the very dramatic storylines. Other than that& my boy seems to like him very well."
15320,4735,5," Fluffy ginger cat with bright green eyes& pink nose and mouth and black wiskers. Moves his paws& ears& mouth& head and tail. My 14 moth old took him seriously: first ran away from him& then yelled at him& then gave him a toy and started making friends. Great cat that makes you smile. Probably even more fun for older children."
15321,4735,5," A lovely glove puppet bought for Grand daughter's 1st birthday& she was delighted with it. Good quality& well made and reasonably priced. Would highly recommend The Puppet Company products."
15322,4735,5," Bought as a gift for group of small children.  Absolutely delightful.  Well made& very cute and appealing. Always recommend Puppet Company products."
15323,4735,5," I have heard good reviews on the Puppet Company products and was not dissapointed in the quality of this item."
15324,4735,5," Gorgeous quality. I use it with my nursery children. I have the puppy too. Love it.â˜º"
15325,4735,1," Disappointed with the quality of this product. Cat appears slightly deformed. It hurts my hand trying to squeeze it into the cats arms. I had one before for my daughter and that was great. Because she lost it we seeked an exact replacement but this one is poorly made. Really disappointed."
15326,4736,5," Bought this puppet with 3 others from the range as a birthday present for my daughter. They are even better than I expected. Good quality and a fantastic toy for exhibiting imagination. If you are thinking of puppets I would definately recommend this range."
15327,4736,5," I bought this for my 3 year old daughter and she loves it. It is a little tall for her arm  (puppet is more than 12 in tall) and she struggles to open and close the mouth with her little fingers but loves to make the princess wave and point using the wooden stick. She made some of the Brighton marathon runners smile by waving at them from the side of the road! A very well made puppet with the look of a Henson character."
15328,4736,5," This puppet is top quality. It reminded me very much of the Muppets Miss Piggy in a way. Very well made. My 5 year old granddaughter loved it."
15329,4736,5," Fab puppet. Really good quality. Easy to hold for little fingers. Well packaged. Really pleased with it. Will go with her theatre. Elaine"
15330,4736,5," Well made puppet &well pleased with this item&brought as a Christmas present for my granddaughter aged 4"
15331,4736,5," Expensive but great quality...the children loved her. We'll just have to buy more puppets later!"
15332,4736,5," Great fun was had by the grand-children at Christmas with their puppet theatre and puppets. Harrogate's |oldies| thought their puppet show was quite the best thing that they had seen for a long time!"
15333,4736,5," really well made and very pleased. its a good size and i do like the hand stick. The kids love it and ideal for my childminding. I recommend to all its such a good puppet."
15334,4737,3," Looks great but its mane comes out rather easily into my daughters mouth. Beware"
15335,4737,5," Bought it for my cat. loves it."
15336,4738,5," I loved this puppet the moment I saw it - my class is called Wizards class and it is perfect to use during Circle Time& when a child needs a friend& as a teaching prop etc.  I ordered it alongside the pirate puppet and both came within 3-4 days of ordering them.  I am very pleased with this purchase - thank you!"
15337,4738,5," My son absolutely loves the Tellatale puppets. They are really good quality and have appealing faces. We use them during story time but he also uses them for general role playing during the day. Merlin is no different and loved by our little wizard. Great for children who love using their imagination."
15338,4738,5," Excellent quality! Bought for a class of 6 year olds and they are enchanted! They do whatever he asks them to do. Would definitely recommend."
15339,4739,4," I was a little skeptical about purchasing a toy that had been licensed to a third party company& i've had issues in the past where i have received items that barely resemble those of which they are supposed to look like.However& the gund Cookie Monster puppet is a great toy. He has lovely plush fur& feels very durable and looks very much like the cookie monster we all know and love. It's not designed for the larger Daddy hand because it's a little getting on and the mouth is a little too small so i find myself getting cramped after attempting to chomp too many cookies.All of this aside& it's great fun and myself and my daughter should get years of fun from it& even if my hand does ache as a result."
15340,4739,4," The cookie monster hand puppet was exactly as per the picture& very good quality& arrived promptly& good value - to sum up& I'm very happy with this purchase!"
15341,4739,4," I bought this so i could entertain my baby with a puppet show. The build quality is excellent but it is not made for daddy sized hands. Cramps sets in quite quickly. So cookie monster will be saved until my little one is a little older so that she can put puppet shows on for me."
15342,4739,5," 5 year old grandson loved him and does a wonderfuil impression of cookie monster wanting cookies"
15343,4739,5," kids love it"
15344,4740,5," great present which was gratefully received"
15345,4741,5," I needed a hamster puppet for an activity to do at school with children.  This hamster is very cute& just as he appears in the photo.  He is not very big and it might be hard to get a large hand in him& but fits me fine.  Not cheap but lovely quality.  Highly recommended if you want a top quality puppet."
15346,4742,5," Excellent model& absolutely delighted. Recommend to anyone interested in buying. You will not be disappointed& I know that I wasn't"
15347,4743,5," This is the second model in the range that I have bought& so I knew what to expect. With excellent build quality and superb detail& I was not disappointed."
15348,4744,4," Great product well built an very quick delivery.only problem is measurements given in cm is size of box not product but would recomend"
15349,4744,5," Great item and the Britains box was kept intact because it was packed in a solid cardboard box& bravo! 10/10"
15350,4744,5," Good product. Fits 1.32 scale tractor as advertised"
15351,4744,4," grandson delighted wiyh this"
15352,4745,5," nice model"
15353,4745,5," Yes"
15354,4746,4," Bought this for my son in law to add to his fleet& and its got pride of place. Well worth the money great model.The only thing to let it down this Eddie Stobart  truck down is its been given left hand drive and not right hand drivelike it should have& But the rest of the detail is well done."
15355,4746,5," this is for my grandson I hope he look after it very well made"
15356,4746,5," Great price first class delivery"
15357,4747,4," Grandson very pleased"
15358,4748,5," Nice Model& Arrived Next Day Thank You"
15359,4749,5," This is an absolutely fabulous and well made toy digger. Very realistic and all moving parts. Looks so like the real thing and is quite heavy. My 5year old grandson was thrilled to bits opening this on christmas morn ....  the look on his face was priceless. Definitely 100% highly recommended. Get one today - you will not be disappointed. Also well packaged and secure in transit."
15360,4749,5," Excellent model& deilvered on time and packaged well& which meant it arrvied undamaged and was as described. I actually brought two& one as a present and I just had to have one for myself!"
15361,4749,4," I've been a diecast model collector for many years& and was excited to see Britains were releasing this as a 1:32 scale model.  Britains must be commended for producing actually a rather good representation.  It's definitely a toy (and is sold as such)& but there is just enough detail& function and realism to satisfy the adult collector.  Some modifications can be made to enhance the model& for example - painting the shiny rivets yellow& and swapping the bucket for a proper two-part clam bucket.I've docked a star as the bonnet is made of plastic& there's an unnatural gap behind the front wheels& the rivets are shiny silver and disassembly is difficult as the model is riveted together (these all need to be drilled out to be able to take it to pieces to modify and improve).Really though& it is a toy& and a very good one at that!"
15362,4749,5," This is a lovely little toy/model. One of the older style JCB's. Children would be used to seeing the newer style in use but it makes a lovely model for collector"
15363,4749,5," I purchased this for my partner he thought it was very good and well worth the moneyi will shop again&"
15364,4749,5," Superb little model good quality with a great deal of detail and it arrived quickly."

15373,4754,5," Bought as a present for fiance as he drives these vehicles at work. This will add another to his collection which takes pride of place."
15374,4755,5," fits nicely in my car collection"
15375,4756,5," As described"
15376,4757,4," I was really impressed by this model and the detail on the model.  Nothing difficult to build and the metal barrel included is a really nice touch.  Everything fit where it was supposed to.  But it turned out really well.I only deducted one star for the rubber tracks which I don't like."

15430,4784,5," Husband loved this for his model train set."
15431,4785,4," The cars that I purchased were die cast and appeared to be very durable. They will prove to be an interesting souvenir of the 2012 Olympics.  Very popular with two pre-school boys."

15437,4785,5," Bought the range of these Great British classic die cast vehicles as souvenirs so aren't played with- but they look fab. When my 2 year old is older he will look back at photo's of the olympic's and the flame running past our house and appreciate these vehicles drapped with the 2012 olympic logo's& as a memorable occassion. I also got a good deal on the set by shopping around so i paid the equivelent to Â£5.50 each. I had also bought the mini double decker die cast classic bus which my son loves playing with and is very durable!!"

15462,4802,5," A big wow was heard when I opened the box and saw the Koach properly for the first time. It is a lovely item& quite sturdy and solid. The lights are bright and the sound effects are loud and distinct. There is an option to leave the Koach with its front and rear lights on when it's on display& which enhances the impact of the model and shows off the detail there is in its construction& and that detail is superb. Worth every penny I'd say."

15464,4803,4," My 3 year old grandson loves his racing cars. I am not sure how robust they are however because there are some plastic bits that could break off but so far they are all in one piece! The cars are not specifically a particular reproduction of a F1 team but the red one clearly is supposed to be a Ferrari and the yellow one a Renault from 2010."
15465,4803,2," The product consists of three cars all individually packed.  The packaging on all three had been opened and crudely resealed with sticky tape.  The quality is poor and the decals on one fell of as it came out of the box.  The 'Try Me' sticker on the top indicates that you turn something to try but in fact you have to push the driver's head.  The pull back mechanism is weak but the sound and flashing rear light areFormula 1 Racing Cars 24cm With Sounds (1:18) - Set of 2 Racing Cars good."
15466,4803,4," These are ideal for my 2 year old son who loves playing with them. relatively well made considering the cost. Would buy again."

15473,4806,2," Sadly quite cheaply made. Very little detail and plasticy. I've also bought the bmw superbike from maisto and that is similar.Looks good from a distance however as I have them on a window sill. But that's beyond the point."
15474,4806,4," item is nice&but wasnt the one pictured&delivery was very quick"
15475,4806,5," Accurate and well detailed - quite remarkable at the price"
15476,4806,5," bought for the hubs he then went got a real one!"
15477,4807,5," this is by far the best and most accurate model of a defender and a bargain at the price.the colour is a genuin lr colour and the rear removeable tilt looks good."
15478,4807,5," Bought the Land Rover Defender along with the Cattle Trailer for our 2 year old granddaughter for Christmas.  She loves switching the lights and engine sound on and off& putting the cattle in and out of the trailer and taking them round the house.  Seems robust and should last a long time."
15479,4807,4," Bought this land rover for my son after a family holiday on a farm and he is really pleased.  The car has a removable rear cover and has working lights.  Is also makes realistic(ish!) car noises when the grey buttons on the bonnet are pressed.It is fairly large and so suitable for little hands.It is well-built"
15480,4807,4," Britains have produced a fine big and quite robust toy with some realistic S well as novelty details such as the horns.Grt value for such aLarge item"
15481,4807,5," i gave this to my sons best friend for his 4th birthday and he thought it was brilliant - he loaded the back up with mini my little ponies and he and my son spent all afternoon playing with it - it's great!"
15482,4807,5," amazing for the price! its big& great detail and the noises are weirdly very accurate!"
15483,4808,5," Item was sent and arrived in good time so happy with delivery. The item was a gift for a family member as they like my real life model& so I've not seen it out of the box yet but they were very happy with it and said the quality was really good. Thank you"
15484,4809,5," Perfect"
15485,4810,5," Well made this toy car is sturdy and doesn't fall apart with just one play. My little boy loves this toy and i WILL BE ORDERING MORE. Many thanks."

15488,4811,5," The best product!!!"
15489,4812,2," THIS WAS A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT.THE PLASTIC LADDERS FALL APART IF YOU TOUCH THEM.THERE ARE 4 STABILISERS ON IT&2 OF WHICH SLIDE OUT WITHOUT TOUCHING THEM AND 2 WHICH ARE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE.VERY POOR QUALITY AND DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE Â£20+IT COST.Â£5 WOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSER TO THE TRUE VALUE.STEER CLEAR UNLESS IT'S FOR PART OF A COLLECTION."
15490,4812,4," The is model is good& body and chassis is looks like the appliance in Strathclyde& the only problem I found was the cage fitted to the booms could have been made better."
15491,4812,5," Christmas present for my dad& sure he won't be disappointed.  Excellent quality& would recommend!  Comes in an excellent sturdy perspex case."
15492,4812,5," Ace model for my model railway"
15493,4813,5," This is my fourth in this series&1/76 is oo gauge so small& but beautifully made.Not for children though super for dioramas ."

15518,4830,5," Within 2 days of purchase& I received the model in the post. The model is a steal for the price and I was certainly not let down. It has working steering& opening engine hood and doors. As an avid collector& I would certainly recommend buying from this seller/buying this car for your own personal collection. Only complaint would be lack of suspension& but I can't complain for the price!!"

15532,4842,5," Fantastic lorry bought for my husband who collects them these are as good as the corgi models very authentic i love the colour of the cab on this lorry highly recommended."
15533,4843,3," The packaging wasn't that good& cardboard easily ripped and plastic easily disfigured so don't be expecting to keep it in its box. The instructions aren't too hard to follow but it took me about an hour to build& this was a long time considering how small the actual bike is. The overall quality of the bike isn't fantastic& only some parts are metal which disappointed me because I thought the whole thing would be metal. Some of the pieces were either a bit bent or slightly misshaped which adds to the difficulty of making the bike. Once made though the bike looks good& the only problem I'm having is that I can't quite get the wheels in line& again this is because of the misshaped parts."

15537,4843,5," he loved it so i was happy and was a good quality item at a fair price happy shopper me"
15538,4843,5," Bought this for partner& he loved it! Great quality& great colour and easy instructions . Looks fantastic when assembled& and keeps him busy for an hour which gives me peace woohoo what more could I need?"
15539,4843,5," My 7 year old son is over the moon with this model! Simple to put together and looks great. His best present this Xmas& he said :)"
15540,4844,4," This is intended as a memory-jogging gift for someone whose first car was an Austin 7& and who had a few more of them over the years& but not for as long."
15541,4845,4," Bought this for my husband to go on the deck of one of his model boats. Just what he had been looking for& was well packaged and arrived very quickly. Only reason it didn't get five stars is that there were French and Dutch transfers  included but sadly no British transfers."
15542,4845,5," Good efficient sevice.Well pleased with product."
15543,4846,3," nice truck& but I thought it was a collectable . there was no certificate of authenticity with this item."

15547,4848,5," Fantastic detail on this tiny scale."
15548,4849,5," Detailed and beautifully-painted die-cast model of the infamous A3 Class Pacific Locomotive 'Flying Scotsman' in its LNER livery and bearing number 4472. Sitting on its own rail plinth inside a plastic presentation case& this static model is intended as an eye-catching exhibit and is bound to serve as a conversation piece. At 1:120 scale& the model is of a size between that of the 'OO' Gauge and 'N' Gauge of model railway sets."
15549,4849,2," The train was ok& but the display box was broken - not much good as a present to display. Won't be buying any more online& not being able to see it."
15550,4849,5," very nice model to add to my collection also first class delivery service thank you.."

15555,4852,5," My 2 year old can dig& wheel about& bath this without a problem.  Can't get it out of his hands.  The sounds are good& loud and loads of fun.  Robust tractor - best one yet"
15556,4852,5," Great toy for the price. We've had our John Deere Monster Treads for over a year and it's still in great condition after a lot of rough and tumble play. The body of the vehicle is plastic but the tyres have a thick& rubber outer which makes for great traction and prevents slipping. There are three lots of sound and light effects when you press the buttons on top of the cab and the battery hasn't run out...it's still loud!. Not the biggest toy at approx. 15.5 x 10 x 11 cm but one that's well detailed& robust and holds my grandson's attention over and over again. More than happy to recommend."
15557,4852,5," Fantastic toy bought for a birthday gift& he loves it!A tractor with lights and sounds which are really good& and a good price."
15558,4852,5," My son absolutely loves this tractor& built well and takes a good beating from him."
15559,4852,5," Excellent toy tractor my two boys loved it and have played with it endlessly. At one point it even went to bed each night with one of them!Three sounds / phrases are fun and quite loud but not too annoying (and I usually can't stand such things). Within days you too will be repeating John Deere marketing slogans every time you see a green tractor!"
15560,4852,5," Grandson loves it as he is a big tractor fan.  Loves the sounds and lights.  Well pleased with it.  Smaller than expected."
15561,4852,5," Great for the kids& got it for a nephew and he loves it. It is rubust and attractive looking and has a nice little 4 wheel steering system when it's pushed down on hard. And the kids love it as it looks great with the big wheels. It is not as big as I thought it would be& about the size&maybe a fraction bigger than a standard model but a lovely toy."
15562,4852,5," My 20 month year old Grandson loves this& he has mastered the art of pressing the 3 buttons that activate the lights. Voice and engine noise& and pushes it along with ease. Don't know how robust it is long term& as he has dropped it occasionally in his excitement ."
15563,4853,5," cracking quality item&will buy again"
15564,4854,5," ok"
15565,4855,5," Kept me busy.Fairly easy to make.Looks good now finished. I would recommend it to any active adult who is interested."

15567,4855,5," as discribed"
15568,4856,5," good value& could not buy local& niece thrilled with it.Packaging was slightly damaged but items were fine inside so no problem"

15572,4856,5," Bought as present for a little girl going into hospital - very good"
15573,4856,4," Daughter really pleased& quick delivery"
15574,4857,4," It wasn't what I thought it would be but it was so lovely that I decided to keep it.I had been asked by my 5 year old grand daughter for a  porcelain tea set as she was so crazy for one so I trawled the Internet for this particular item& not easy& but I came across the tea set and ordered it& after thinking about it I realised it would be too small for little hands and got something else instead. When it did arrive & it was so lovely& so I gave it to her as well as the other present and her and her sisters went straight to their dolls house and had a most wonderful time playing with it. I must add that if she hadn't have liked it I would have kept it for myself."
15575,4857,5," A very good set of dining ware with juicy strawberries on excellent value"
15576,4858,5," Really good quality."

15580,4860,5," Excellent service& very happy with product."
15581,4861,4," These times items were bought for my granddaughter and I hesitated for a while before making my purchase.  Not that I have them (and they took a while to arrive as warned)& I am really glad that I got them.  They are delightful - and so much better than similar items made in plastic.  They have some weight go them& the detail is good& and I am now looking to see what other items Generic offer."
15582,4861,5," Just perfect for my daughters little cafe& item as described. Arrived before expects delivery& would buy again!"
15583,4861,5," My daughter was so excited that these are made of proper metal"
15584,4861,5," Well made - fiddly to handle& but correct size for 1/12th dolls house."
15585,4861,5," Minute and well made& I would recommend this cutlery."
15586,4862,5," My daughter got this for her 4th birthday shortly after her own sports day at nursery. It is really cute with little eggs and spoons and sacks. Great fun and because she had just done all the sport (well not hockey/baseball) she knew how to play with it. I can't comment on price as it was a gift."
15587,4862,5," My daughter loves this little set. She is adding to her collection all the time and the little egg and spoon and hockey sticks really make this fun for her. I hear her talking to herself acting out the characters and putting on differents voices. She may only be five but this is educational for her and stimulates her roleplay skills. This item arrived promptly too after it was ordered& which was just before Christmas."
15588,4862,4," Lovely cute item& standard Sylvanian quality and feel. Personally I think the brand is overpriced however as a Christmas present I have to put that aside. Indeed I much prefer this type of traditional toy to plastic stuff covered in LEDs& so pleased with it and I am sure my niece will enjoy playing with them with her friend!"
15589,4862,5," Bought a selection of the Sylvanian Families to make up a  Christmas present for my grand-daughter ....... she was not dissappointed! Tiny parts which will not be suitable for very young children& which make them use their imagination& my grand-daughter is 7yrs"
15590,4862,5," Very prompt delivery& one very excited girl when poring the gift& love all the details and accessories that come with it& hours of fun. Thank you"
15591,4862,4," I bought this for my daughter but the sacks for the sack race were not included.Although there were missing parts it was still great fun for her."
15592,4862,5," I love this item  - very detailed and well packed well ll worth what I paid Will give hours of pleasure to myself and my grandaughter"
15593,4862,5," My grand-daughter was very happy with this christmas presant to add to her school collection& which is getting very big"
15594,4863,5," Very cute"
15595,4864,5," My daughter is three so the top fits ok with room to grow and the trousers are a bit long but we just rolled them up. She loved them so I'm happy!"
15596,4864,5," This is so cute and easy for my daughter to put on herself she wears 6-7 and is 4yrs old so it's a good fit"

15601,4865,5," Perfect for Christmas! Love it& idea for any collector or as my daughter has just started to collect them ideal for Christmas"
15602,4865,4," Ordered this and other items on behalf of a friend for her grand daughters for Xmas& she said it was what the kids had asked for but also she thought they are expensive for what they are."
15603,4865,5," AA really lovely product for a little girl& all the good qualities of Sylvannian family and more& lots of play appeal and things to do. excellent product in everyway and excellent serevic"
15604,4865,3," My daughter asked for this as part of her xmas prezzie.  I am a little disapointed in how little you get for the price of the ite&"
15605,4865,5," Received quick& it is a Christmas present so not opened yet. Looks good though. Positive rating as nothing looks wrong with it."
15606,4865,5," Another lovely Syvanian set& I was pleased that the Christmas tree was so big. 5 stars."
15607,4866,4," Nice little dinning set for Barbie sized dolls. The table is more of a coffee table as the legs are not long but it is bright& appears sturdy enough for my 8 year old and she loves it. It was sent well within allocated time and was very well packaged. Overall I'm really happy with this and its actually better than I expected for the price I paid."
15608,4866,5," Grand kids have spent hours with the table and diner set& watch out for the small parts with little ones."
15609,4866,4," lovely set granddaughters love it"
15610,4866,5," Good value for the money"
15611,4866,5," Really worth the money."
15612,4867,5," Really nice"
15613,4868,5," This is exactly what my daughter has been looking for& but it was a lot cheaper than the high street store prices. Excellent quality."
15614,4869,5," Just perfect for my daughters little cafe& item as described. Arrived before expects delivery& would buy again!"
15615,4869,5," Good product& made me smile& love the sliced toast too."

15618,4869,5," Good quality item& I would recommend this toaster"
15619,4870,1," What about information on how to use this very poor product"
15620,4870,5," Very good cost a lot more in minitures doll shops &does the job without any problems"
15621,4870,5," Brilliant! Arrived quickly. Really happy with the product. All works as expected."

15625,4872,5," GOOD FUN FOR MY TINY SKELENTONS"
15626,4873,5," Xmas present for my 10 year old daughter who is a great Sylvanians fan. She is delighted with it& constantly telling me how 'detailed' it is !"
15627,4873,4," This is a lovely little set that will provide hours of playtime. The only thing is the shoeboxes are way too flimsy and my daughter found it hard to find shoes to fit her figures."
15628,4873,4," Very good as expected& only small issue is my 6 year old finds some shoes a little hard to put on the figures."
15629,4873,5," Lovely toy with lots of accessories. Lovely addition to our Sylvanian collection."
15630,4873,5," Lots of lovely pieces for your Animals. Good value set ."
15631,4874,4," For such small& strange toys& these Shopkins seem to give hours of amusement and play.In this 5 pack& one shopkin is packaged separately& and is likely to be a 'rare' edition.My daughter loves these& and is always adding to her collection"
15632,4874,5," My Daughter is obsessed with these things and i ordered two packs& arrived very quickly and afew she already had but most of her friends have them so she was able to swap them for ones she didnt have& they are a good price and have bought more fab Thankyou"

15634,4874,5," Great my daughter loves shopkins and these were great as they are series 2."
15635,4874,5," arrived before stated one very happy daughter."
15636,4874,3," They are expensive. Although the price I got on Amazon was the cheapest I could find. They are small and they are grocery items. Inexplicably my daughter adores them. I've tried moshi monsters which are bigger brighter and more imaginative but she always goes back to the tiny margarine tub. Or ketchup bottle. So yes they are what she wanted. I don't play with them though."
15637,4874,5," My daughter loves Shopkins so this was bound to be a hit& good reasonable price and super fast delivery!"
15638,4874,5," my daughter love it"
15639,4875,5," Great item of furniture for your dolls house. It's like a miniature version of a great quality piece of furniture. Very highly recommended. Came fast and the little doors open on the front. Top marks"
15640,4875,5," Well made& will now have to look for video/dvd players to fit in the shelving."
15641,4875,4," Would recommend  it will make your little girls doll's perfect"
15642,4875,5," Looks lovely in my granddaughters dolls house& nice quality"

15645,4876,5," Exactly as described. Just what I needed to complete the fairy dell under my Acer tree.=^..^="
15646,4876,5," These little stepping stones are lovely. There are four in the pack and look really cute."
15647,4876,5," look really good in my fairy garden. have them leading to the fairy house. so cute"

15663,4882,5," lovely.my grandaughter thinks its brill."
15664,4883,5," beautiful"
15665,4884,5," This phone is so lovely& the detail is just how I remember from the 50'sThe weight was suprising but this makes it stableDelivery was excellent"
15666,4884,5," so cute& love this little item& it will look very good in the dolls house. good quality."
15667,4884,5," A lovely little retro phone. Great details .well made good"
15668,4884,5," Good quality& grandson loves this in the dolls house"
15669,4885,5," Good kits - easy to build and compatible with both Skytrex and Battlefront models. Well recomended as a cheaper alternative to the metal or resin kits. There is considerable conversion potential with these models."
15670,4886,5," Very happy"
15671,4887,5," great box set"
15672,4888,5," well constructed scale model a must for wargamers recon games& ideal for use in ww2& korea using excellent games systems such as bolt action or ambush alley"
15673,4889,5," great and  fast service"
15674,4890,5," Brilliantly quick service that was hassle free.The bases were exactly what I wanted and described perfectly.Would recommend again"
15675,4890,5," As they say they are on the tin! Useful size for basing 15mm tanks as well as artillery."
15676,4891,5," great quality"
15677,4892,5," Really good kit& comes in good sized box with nice cover art& full colour build and painting instructions& additional parts include bench table& water urn& ladder and perching eagle& ideal for re-enacting any desert war scene& comes with 2nr airfix flying hours tokens& hope airfix will start to re-release the large scale panzer and cromwell tanks to match& the bamboo house would also be welcome& easy to build and paint and reasonably priced"
15678,4892,4," Airfix just as I remembered them& delivery was prompt as ive come to expect now and price and quality were very good."
15679,4892,5," Received in good condition& no damage to box or internal parts.Delighted as never made this as a kid but good for Rommell's halftrack diorama!"
15680,4892,5," good addition to my sons already growing armed forces goes well with soldiers happy with product not found this in local shops"
15681,4892,5," This arrived promptly and was well packaged.Brought back memories of being a kid again some 30 - 40 years ago.Airfix use the same graphics which no doubt is an excellent marketting touch& giving it a retro and nostalgic dimension.  Is at 1:32 scale and seems to be good.  Was a christmas present for my 4 year old boy to go with a number of 1:32 soldiers."
15682,4893,3," Overall this is a decent toy but it can hardly stand up and it's near impossible to fit the gun into one of its hands."
15683,4893,5," How educational is this toy? Well& a lot if you like Halo I suppose!How durable is it? Can't say& as I bought it as a collectors item and haven't taken it out of the packet!What I can say& is that it looks great through the plastic wrapping!Not a good review I'm afraid& but I didn't like seeing it without any comments.I'm sad aren't I?!"
15684,4894,5," My Grandson was absolutely delighted with this present& it gave him enormous pleasure and kept him occupied for hours in the day."
15685,4894,3," was not that impressed with the price for such little things but grand children like them so they were worth it"
15686,4894,5," Great for the little boy in my life.  Christmas present child not yet seen but I'm sure he will be thrilled."
15687,4894,5," So cute thought they were bigger but so what there toys my son will be so exited when he gets these"
15688,4894,5," they are a bit small but they put a smile on my boys face when playing with them"
15689,4894,3," This was purchased for my 9 year old son& he wanted the set after seeing them advertised on the TV. To be honest for what you get it is quite expensive& I guess you are paying for the brand. He probably played with them for 3 days before he got bored& torso's& spines and legs started appearing everywhere! They are quite sturdy and I was surprised how long they lasted with my very heavy handed child! They are good for a little light entertainment but don't expect them to be a firm favourite or regular 'played with' toy."
15690,4894,5," My son loves these at present and buying in a pack is cheaper."
15691,4894,5," the children love these and will play with them for hours"
15692,4895,5," Great item& good value for money."
15693,4895,5," Fantastic value."
15694,4895,5," Excellent"
15695,4896,5," Admittedly they haven't made it into a diorama yet but I bought them for the models& I plane to incorporate them into a pan aster diorama but they are great models out right. Load are included for the price and each model is off a great quality. I have found that ins infix kits the quality seems to drop in group kits but this kit doesn't have |quality-for-money| syndrome which i've so creatively dubbed other kits. No personnel are included but for Â£6 you can get an RAF personnel set that goes great with this kit. I would recommend this to all levels& it can get fiddle at time but other than that's it's a doddle."
15696,4896,5," Very good detail& goes together nicely. Great bombs and trolleys& infact I really enjoyed building this kit. Took me ages but I am a novice. Looks great painted and really sets my airfield diorama off. I use it with a pathfinder combo of a Lancaster and a mosquito plus 30 raf personnel ground crew. Recommended."
15697,4896,5," As to a |base| for this - I would think something about the size of the base included in the WW I tanks and infantry set (The |Western Front| set) -  that came in two halves but went together quite well - but with |grass and concrete| -  maybe with another Lancaster and a mosquito (as another reviewer stated)  plus a control tower and some ground personnel"
15698,4896,5," Really good kit in light grey plastic. No flash and fits together well. Looks great when finished and enhances any diorama. The vehicles are worth the price alone and you get lots more...."
15699,4896,5," There is a lot to this model but it makes a display very realistic on a world war two layout ."
15700,4896,5," I bought this for my Dad for Christmas& It's just what he wanted and was a good price. I would recommend it for anyone."
15701,4896,5," really great& a formidable ideemany oportunities to convert the kits (f.e. the tractor) an so on.Love itAnd: Perfect moulding etc."
15702,4896,5," A great set with several vehicles from WW2 RAF bases. Nice models to make and with 1:72 aircraft would make a great RAFdiorama"
15703,4897,5," Great little models"
15704,4898,5," I bought the same thing from eBay& there are 2 versions of it& this ones constructed so that it comes away from the eyes and upper teeth section. The other version lifts off from the forehead.I didn't read the dimensions when I went to buy my one..thinking it would be life sized for head shape but it's only a small item..but to be honest it's a nice little collectable to have. Next time I'd like to get the full sized with neck and plague with the light up eyes for the shelf.It isn't metal but the paint job on it looks fantastic& has the right colouring and shine and a nice weight to it. It's one of those things in my opinion you want to keep safe and look after. I have it sat on top of my sub woofer at the moment..it's a lovely little collectable from the Terminator movies really.So yeah& I'm proud of it for the price. I'd like the full scale life size red eyes light up next..it'll be worth the 2-Â£300.I find it works quite well for close up macro focus adjustment if you were to shoot pictures or some HD video angles with it.Nice little piece& top marks :)"
15705,4898,4," Delivered in plenty of time and securely packaged. Great detail although it's not metal it's got a nice weighty feel to it considering it's size. The eyes don't light up (although I wasn't looking for this anyway) and although it's nowhere near full-sized (which you'd expect based on it's price - it's around 11cms tall) it looks very impressive under my PC monitor :)...I've attached a couple of photos with a typical-sized tea mug next to it for some perspective..."
15706,4898,5," Received this superb item very quickly and nicely packaged too! It has a real quality feel and looks very impressive sat on my Playstation !Would shop here again with pleasure.... Thank You !"
15707,4898,5," Solid& heavy casting in resin. The plating looks perfect. A fantastic piece. Looks a lot better in real life than the photos."
15708,4898,4," This is a present for my husband.  It looks good however I would have preferred if it was a bit bigger (its about 10cm high).  The top section can lift off to store little knick knacks should you wish.  Overall it is good quality but it could be priced a little lower."
15709,4898,5," i just got it and it is great the attention to detail has been kept the exact way the endos are in the films anyone who is a fan of arnies films and also the terminator films then this should be in your collection."
15710,4898,5," This Terminator skull is fantastic& the detail is amazing and the finish is so professional.The weight of it feels like metal& the teeth look very realistic too.It is bigger than i thought it was going to be and it doubles as a good box to put small bits in.overall I am very impressed with the product."
15711,4898,5," excellent item&very detailed a great piece to add to your Terminator collection buy it!"
15712,4899,5," My kids are always trying to play with my tarp when I come back from camping so thought its about time they had of their own to play with. So far its held up to 2 kids using it for dens& fighting over it& at one point trying to use it to make a slide and its still holding up well."
15713,4899,5," A good size for Den building. Holes around the edges to pin sheet to make secure. The kids enjoy going under with torches."
15714,4899,5," Fab product& exactly as described. Many hours of den building already and also used as a ground sheet when camping."
15715,4899,5," Very strong and will give our son hours of play in his den at the bottom of the garden"
15716,4899,5," Bought for Grandsons 4th Birthday& good service"
15717,4899,5," Arrived quickly and the children love making dens out of it."
15718,4900,5," This was my first Gunpla build"
15719,4900,5," This is an a amazing build Took really long but was worth it"
15720,4901,5," I bought this as a gift for my teenage son who is a collector of all things Ghost and Assassins Creed. The figure is sturdy& good quality& well packaged and looks good. My son was very happy with it :) :) Would recommend for a collector of figures!"
15721,4901,5," Quite a big fan of the franchise and a figures collector as well& it was hard for me to keep back so I purchased the figure without second thoughts. Upon delivery& I was surprised by the weight of the box& it's quite far from what I was expecting. It is heavy& and while the height of the figure might justify a proper base to keep it steady& I just think this is way to heavy. I wouldn't make a point of it but at the moment the shelf I use only holds 10kgs and it's filled up with figures. All in one& I'd still say it's a good balance between size and weight.The details is very crisp and the painting is really outstanding. The glasses have a nice light refraction effect done by combining silver/metal with blue and they have the small outstanding blue area with information that's part of the Ghosts squad tech. The figure comes with 2 optional transparent discs that have some thin blue information printed on them to replicate the blue radius around the weapons in-game (ammo count etc). They are well protected on both sides with a piece of paper& it might prove a bit difficult to unstick but take care as it would be a shame to scratch it. I tried the figure for a week without those discs but ended up adding them as it offers a better view and a more accurate insight on the battle gear.The hand that holds the gun barrel (left hand& that is) is a bit funny upon closer inspection & as it seems that Kovak's palm has some exaggerated long fingers. Might be however an illusion because of the way the gloves are coloured but I highly doubt it. However it can barely be noticed from close up distance so it would be stupid to turn this into a deal-breaker. The boots also seem to be a bit to big but once again& nothing to worry about.Last thing& the above mentioned base has 4 rubber feet that really hold it in place on shiny surfaces.Same quality from Ubi Collectibles. A must-buy for the Ghost Recon fans out there!"
15722,4901,5," I bought this is hope to get a nifty figure to have on my sound system and what I got instead was far better than I had ever expected. The level of detail on this PVC model is just astounding. For the price& you couldn't go wrong.For a video review of this product take a look at my YouTube Channel where I review most of the Gaming related products I purchaseHere the link to the unboxing of this product -  http:"
15723,4902,4," Is great wooden pirate ship perfect for papo pirates it is a great toy and we'll worth the money great!"
15724,4902,5," Great present :)"
15725,4903,5," A smurf figure& just like the picture shows& thanks."
15726,4903,5," Shiver me 'earties.... Excellent... Recommended"
15727,4904,5," This gift set is excellent value I am very pleased with it.  The moveable parts make it fantastic fun and the kids got great entertainment out of it.  It is a brilliant addition to some of the other pirate playmobil sets but also works as a stand alone toy.  These toys are great for kids imagination and provide hours of fun."
15728,4904,5," Fantastic alternative to chocolate eggs and then they become money boxes.Good quality and a great buy. Kids love them."
15729,4904,5," Very happy"
15730,4904,1," This item was a good idea but unfortunately the goods were not as good as expected. I would not buy anymore of these items."
15731,4905,5," My little boy is having fun playing with these figures. I bought them to go with the Villa Villekulla playset."
15732,4905,5," Good product and fast shipment"
15733,4905,5," very nice thanx :-)"
15734,4906,5," This is a great a little set that my son loves& as does his older brother. Theres so much detail in playmobil toys down to little cuffs and gun holsters. It closes up and clips shut which is great for travel. Really simple to put together. It arrived in an unnecessarily large box as do most playmobil  toys. But its definitely worth the money."
15735,4906,5," Great addition to the pirates set& great for indoor play when it's too wet/ cold to play outside with the boats that we have. This cannon is the same type you get with the boats& unlike the one here - Playmobil 4797 Super 4 Gunpowder Island Hideout"
15736,4906,5," Bargain price and great toy!"
15737,4906,4," 4 year old grandson loves pirates so this was a successful present. It took a bit of putting together but is much played with toy."
15738,4906,5," Fantastic set & well designed and packaged.Plenty for the young imagination to play withfor hours."
15739,4906,4," Bought for birthday present& very happy with purchase and even better in the sale great value for money."
15740,4906,5," Got this at a bargain price from Amazon. My son loves it and takes it all over with him."
15741,4906,2," The box was partly damaged with scuff marks and was also covered in dust upon arrival."
15742,4907,2," These figures were rather small and did not capture much interest from either my 3 year old or 5 year old Grandsons. They preferred their original set of pirates which were larger."
15743,4907,5," Much larger than I expected. The three year old boy loved it& one of his favourite presents. Would have liked a Jake figure as well as those included but that is a minor bug bear."
15744,4907,5," Expensive but much loved. Warning thoughâ€¦ if your child is playing with these in the bath the paint on the characters does mark the bath if scraped along the side."
15745,4907,5," Bought for our 3 year old boy for his Christmas stocking.  Really enjoys Jake and the Neverland Pirates.  Excellent Value."
15746,4907,5," Well made figures not a bad price and good to buy Hook alone rather than in a pack of figures& would recommend."
15747,4907,5," loved it. it was exacly what i exspected. my kid is going to love it. keep on th  good work."
15748,4907,5," Item was as described Bought to go with the pirate ship.would reccommend"
15749,4908,5," Really happy with this. There are a lot of pieces - map& sexton& compass& book& bottle of rum etc. some of which are quite small. The map is only card and my son promptly folded it to put in the chest! It is now laminated so should last a little longer!"
15750,4908,4," This item was requested as a Christmas present. Although I was pleased with the delivery etc& it hasn't been played with as yet. I am sure it will get plenty of use when it's been opened."
15751,4908,5," When the ship had been assembled my grandson was very pleased to have the captain with all the treasure seeking equipment such as the map.  He loved this llpresent!"
15752,4909,5," Bought for when Grandson visits to use with his BIG pirate boat. Its brilliant lots of lovely bit and pieces and will keep him and Grandad amused for ages. A big thumbs up"
15753,4909,5," As advertised. quality brand and good product."
15754,4909,5," Good value for money"
15755,4909,5," thank you A+"
15756,4910,4," Added to party bags that were a bit girly for the boys....they are sturdier than I expected and seem to be pretty good quality.  The kids liked them.  Would recommend."
15757,4910,5," these rings are very good quality and will be perfect for our pirate themed partygrandson loves them and the fit is goodadults can also wear them ... bonus"
15758,4910,4," good service& nice product& met all expectations. good as a pirate party bag filler& children seemed to like them although possibly a bit large for tiny fingers"
15759,4910,5," Good quality& arrived on time. Busy what I wanted as party favors.  They were a big hit with 5 year olds."
15760,4910,5," Excellent& cleaverly made to fit any finger& very pleased especially with the quality& absoloutly Fab!"
15761,4910,5," Really nice rings that are well made.  I was really pleased with them and would buy them again."
15762,4910,4," was not disappointed with these only with the fact they did not arrive in time for the party"
15763,4910,5," These are fun items and were really great for my son's loot bags at his birthday party& they are made of rubber so stretch over bigger fingers as well. I recieved an assortment of designs which was great. They are good value. I recieved six as stated and they arrived within a few days."
15764,4911,4," Brought for a present for grandsons birthday to go with pirate boat& they were a nice size bigger than expected& looked well made and sturdy& and most of all grandson loved them. Arrived very quickly would use again."
15765,4911,5," This was a gift for boys 4th birthday. Feedback was that he loved it."
15766,4912,1," I was a little disappointed with this CD. It only comes in a cardboard sleeve and only consists of 6 tracks& 2 of which are instrumental. Not exactly a 'party' cd but a few tracks for one."
15767,4912,4," This is a CD I bought for a pirate party& had it on in the background and is more a music/ atmosopheric CD with some creaky boat noises too...fun to have on over the pirate lunch...with kids dressed up they used it as backing music to their play. Put 5/5 for durability if parents look after the disc!"
15768,4912,5," Ordered this as I needed some sailor themed music for my year 2 class for dance. This was just right. Very child friendly."
15769,4913,5," I got Izzy for my son to go along with the pirate ship. He enjoys playing with it. Got it at discounted price which was even better."
15770,4913,4," My daughter loves these and plays with them everyday with her big pirate ship& they are very simple but good quality."
15771,4913,5," Nice& simple well made toys. They stand up without wobbling over& and go well with ither Jake figures and pirate ship. My grandson& aged 3& poves them& and also plays with them in the bath. Items are well packaged and arrived quickly."
15772,4913,5," Expensive but much loved. Warning thoughâ€¦ if your child is playing with these in the bath the paint on the characters does mark the bath if scraped along the side."
15773,4913,5," Both my children are obsessed with Jake and we needed an Izzy to make up the set. Job done!"
15774,4913,5," Arrived on time and in good condition. And was really well priced. Overall really happy"
15775,4914,4," My boy loves the skeleton capt and officer which are for the imaginext pirate ship& I would have given 5 stars however I felt the price was a little steep and they came from America why? ( Do we not have these toys in the UK? )"
15776,4914,3," a lot of money for what they are but grandson liked."
15777,4914,5," No complaints"
15778,4915,5," very nice thanx :-)"
15779,4916,5," Adorable as he stands next to my kitchen sink. Exactly what you'd expect from a Schleich Smurf"
15780,4916,5," Excellent"
15781,4917,5," I bought this wooden pirate ship for  pre-school children up to five years fo age. This study wooden ship has everything you expect of pirates - a attached springy walk-the-plank& canons& rope ladder& rowing boat& a captain to place in the crow's nest& crew members& a treasure chest& The back of the ship has a springy opening for children to put things in (or take out)& a wheel to steer and  an anchor. We placed this ship in a tuff top (on the floor) with sand& starfish& shells& fish& sharks&parrots& golden nuggets and silver coins the children made& treasure chests& spades& rakes and containers. The pirate ship certainly finished off the children's pirate theme along with them making telescopes& maps and dressing up. I thoroughly recommend this pirate ship. It is beautifully made and well worth buying.p.s. Just wanted to add that 3 years on& this toy (and accessories) are still in one piece even with lots of children constantly playing with it. It certainly is very sturdy and robust."
15782,4917,4," My little boy loves this even though he is only two.  The rest of the family seem to love it too!I think he will get a lot of use out of it for the next few years and it certainly seems very durable& as I keep finding parts of it in various locations in the house.  A great buy."
15783,4917,5," This is an excellent durable toy with bags of appeal. I bought this ship for my daughter when she was three and she still plays with it now at (very nearly) seven years old. Her younger brother also enjoys playing with this boat and its a nice toy for them to play with together.Even though a lot of the pieces are removable (cannons& steering wheel& mast& ladder& rope ladder& upper deck etc) we haven't lost any of the pieces and they all fit together nicely still. The movable bits (plank and loading door at the back) are attached with elastic and they haven't broken or been pulled off either.This is a gorgeous real wood toy that is simple& strong and sturdy but also really appeals to children from 2-7 years old. It is one of the most enduring and appealing of all the wooden toys I have bought for our children. Even though its expensive I think its a very good toy to buy for your first child and pass on to subsequent children& knowing that it won't break or get damaged easily."
15784,4917,5," I bought this toy for my grandson's 4th birthday. He loves It!It seems very robust and is good value for money."
15785,4917,5," Well made with lots of interesting detail to encourage play."
15786,4918,5," You can add (with this package) more elements to your NEVERLAND stuff. It's a nice pack."
15787,4919,5," Super set of pirates. They will be going in the pirate ship we have bought my son for Christmas. Excellent Big Jigs quality as always."
15788,4919,5," Great little [ wooden ]characters & forget all them plastic ones & these are |cool| [ and that`s something coming from an old granddad ] this is my [ oops & our third purchase of a range of these characters ]& think it`s about time I let the grandchild get to play with them !"
15789,4919,4," Very pleased with these pirates& though they a bit bigger than I expected. They are very well made and have distinctive and appealing characters. My grandsons might have liked them to look a bit more dastardly!"
15790,4919,5," This is a gorgeous set. They look great and are well made. Looking forward to my son opening them on his birthday."
15791,4919,5," They are brilliant having 8 grandchildren toys get a lot of use so sturdy toys are a must"
15792,4920,5," Great figure& a figure that a collector must have. The headsculpt is awesome& highly detailed. The body is faithfully reproduced and the jacket is really looking good.In the end& i like a lot this one."
15793,4921,2," Item does not come with 10 doubloons as stated only comes with 5. Was very disappointed as only ordered because this apparently came with extra doubloons. Contacted seller to suggest they change their description as it is incorrect. Appart from that item seems good but havent opened fully as bought for a Christmas pressie"
15794,4921,5," My 3 year old son loves this product. It's durable and easy to use. The discs fly out at some speed but obviously don't cause any damage. Makes sounds and looks great - what more could a 3 year old want! Fab! Was an excellent stocking filler (but too big to fit in a stocking!)"
15795,4921,5," Good item which was purchased as a Christmas present for my grandson who is a huge J"
15796,4921,3," Great item good quality but as with all these things the projectiles go missing in minutes...not sure if you can buy replacements..."
15797,4921,5," Well worth the money& my 4 year old loves it. Just need to see if you can buy the dabloons separately as we've lost 2 already :)"
15798,4921,5," Brought as a.present quick delivery and enjoyed by the recipient"
15799,4921,5," Very good quality toy for the price ordered more as gifts"
15800,4922,5," I've been searching everywhere for Smee& Sharkey and Bones figures with no luck so when I found this I had to buy it.  It's good value too as it's a 7 figure pack (including the chest and Peter Pans shadow in the sack).  My lil man loves playing with these along with Bucky and the Jolly Roger& hours of good entertainment!!"
15801,4922,5," Brought for my 3Â½ year old boy.  He loves the collection.  Durable and hard wearing.  Needed extra characters.  This was better value then buying individually. Although we have 3 Captain Hooks now. Brought to go with Hooks battle Boat"
15802,4922,5," Characters look great very pleased& great price too in comparison with other places. Highly recommend& my daughter is a very happy girl!"
15803,4922,5," My daughter is quite the fan of Peter Pan and Jake"
15804,4922,5," I have bought Jake and the Never land pirate ship for my granddaughter& she loves the programme on tele&so thought it would be great to get all th other characters to go with it! Think she will love them"
15805,4922,5," Wonderful I wish this product was aivailble in the United States. I would recommend this toy to a friendMy child loves it."
15806,4922,5," These figures are great& got mine for a fantastic price& my daughter loves playing with them& especially with her new bucky ship"
15807,4922,4," Exactly what it said it was! Used these to decorate my daughters cake and they have become a great addition to her toys"
15808,4923,4," Ive just bought this for my son (2yrs). He loves it! His 2 sisters (3 and 4yrs) love it too. Took me about 20 minutes to assemble which surprised me as I thought by the look of all the parts it would take me alot more! I researched this ship as much as possible but there wasnt much of a product description& so I took a chance on it. I will explain in detail how it is so you know: There is a crows nest. A steering wheel that moves. A walk the plank that is attached by a tight elastic letting you move it on to the ship's deck or off the side. A crows nest with wooden flag on top (this flag is flimsy and I dont think it will be long before it gets snapped off). A wooden grill on the deck that you can remove to put prisoners into the hull below. The back of the boat has a door that you can open to remove prisoners from or just put your pirates inside. 3 material sails attached to the mast by thin elastic ties. You have to untie them and tighten them when fixing them to the wooden masts which was VERY tricky to do. I think that's it! There are no wheels underneath the boat& but it has a smooth bottom so it slides along ok. We bought the 3-pack Budkins pirates and the Ghost pirate Budkin to go with it as it does NOT come with figures. All in all& very happy with it :)"
15809,4923,4," Nice ship - its quite expensive for what it is - but my son likes it"
15810,4923,4," A well received present for a three year old"
15811,4924,5," This is quite a hard to get figure so I was delighted to get Izzy at this price. Bit small& but great to join the other characters."
15812,4924,5," Looked great on top of cake and now used as toy after birthday"
15813,4924,5," The size is perfect for what i wanted& cake decoration"
15814,4924,5," Great!"
15815,4925,5," This toy has been a great hit with my son who received the Le Toy Van wooden pirate ship for Christmas along with it.  He has actually played more with this as it has plenty of accessories and can easily be carried from one room to another or to a friend's house.  Great detail in the pirates and accessories and perfect for children who enjoy imaginative play."
15816,4925,5," Ideal for taking on holiday as it all packs into its own case.Room to take extra pirates.some bits a bit small& but this is to be expected.As always with Playmobile the quality is very good and will last a long time.This has travelled Europe on holiday with my son."
15817,4925,3," this looks great when its advertised but unfortunately its a bit flimsy and not alot to it really.  its not one of my sons favourite toys!"
15818,4925,4," I purchased this for my six year old son. He loves the playmobil range and regularly plays with this product. I especiall like the fact that it clips together storing everything neatly inside."
15819,4925,4," Lovely toy& nice and easy to put away as it folds up with everything inside& but it seemed quite expensive"
15820,4926,5," absolutely love this item& fantastic value for money a great buy. I have got this for my 2 yr old boy for Christmas& I have opened the box and inspected all the pieces and im in love with it. parts are not small enough to swallow so its great. fantastic detail and in a lovely box my boy will love this and I am going to get his brother the farm set. fully recommend it"
15821,4926,5," Good value"
15822,4927,5," We purchased this wooden toy pirate ship for our boy's third birthday. It was an instant hit with him and his friends. The ship is all made of wood& and includes wooden and string pirates aswell as rigging& sails& flag& treasure chest& barrels& steps and cannons. It is very well made& and built to a durable standard. Some parts are difficult for small hands to put together& however& it is very sturdy& allows complex and imaginative play and educates about rigging and sails& anchors and crowsnests etc...Many other pirate ships are soley made from plastic and are mimicing the pirates of the carribean francise including 'ghost' sailers...this is more in line with a generic pirate tradition and allows wider play scenerios to be played out. Lots of fun! A great toy."
15823,4927,5," Still a favorite toy of my grandson (6) almost 2 months after Christmas.He plays with it as a pirate ship& hides things in its hull& takes bits off and rebuilds them. Excellent buy."
15824,4927,4," I bought this three weeks ago and since then my two children enjoyed playing with this ship and its accessories very much. The only thing is that some parts of the ship (especially the sails and the front end) tend to move away quite easily. Apart from that this is a very nice toy and comes complete with pirates& treasure chest and cannons for hours and hours of fun."
15825,4927,5," I bought this for use in a preschool setting& and am really very satisfied with my purchase. The pirate ship is very well made and comes with a good range of play pieces (enough for a small group of children to play together quite happily). At the younger end of the spectrum for playing with this& you might find that you need to glue the masts in place to stop them from falling over every couple of minutes but otherwise this is a well-made& robust and FUN pirate set that really gets youngsters' imaginations going.According to one extremely satisfied user |It's my bestest toy EVER| - so much so& that his mum has gone out to buy one for him to use at home.5/5"
15826,4927,5," I bought this for my 2 year old son for Christmas.  He loves pirates and I wanted a good quality& wooden toy for him in order to counteract the vast quantities of plastic tat we have at home!5 months later& the pirate ship is still one of his favourite toys and is played with daily.  It is lasting well& with no breaks as yet (a miracle as it has taken a battering!)It comes complete with pirates& cannons and a treasure chest so there are no costly extras to pay for.The only niggle (mentioned by other reviewers) is that the front sail& main sails and flag do fall off A LOT.  In fact& I spend a lot of time putting them back on and am looking for a more permanent solution (perhaps superglue?)I'd thoroughly recommend this toy - it looks great& seems to get little imaginations going and does stand up well to the demands of a 2 year old!"
15827,4927,4," Great quality item that my 2 year old loves. Looked after a few to buy him for Christmas& I went for this one as it came with the pirates included& compared to others where these were extra& after all what is the point of a pirate ship without pirates& and I am very happy with my purchase and the value for money. Was easy to put together& although the instructions were not that clear& and the strings on the sails seem a little long and unnecessary& but this does not affect my son's enjoyment of playing with the ship& the only thing that is missing for him during play is a plank to get the pirates to |walk the plank|& but he just pretends there is one. He has already has had hours of fun with this toy since receiving it and I am sure he will have many more& as it is a great quality item that will grow with him."
15828,4927,4," I bought this toy as a 3rd birthday gift for my pirate obsessed son. He absolutely loved it. There are so many different bits to it that he has played happily on his own for hours.the only things i would point out are that the clothing on the pirates have come undone during play and the sails have had to be glued into place as my son gets frustrated that they keep coming out of the mast."
15829,4928,5," What every little boy wants& I get them for my grandson Freddie& he is into knights and pirates& at the moment."
15830,4928,5," Looks fab! Sure my son will live these in Christmas Day!"
15831,4929,4," I did look on Smyths for this toy but this one had better things in the chest! Im very happy with it and my son. I bought it before xmas and it was only Â£14.50 then. happy days!!"
15832,4929,5," Got this for my son who is 2Â½ and he loves it. He looks great in it. Map only lasted a few minutes but this is well worth the money"
15833,4929,3," Not a lot for the money but my 3 year old nephew absolutely loves it. Not bad quality but I think it was overpriced."
15834,4929,3," For the price and the size of the box it comes in you'd expect a bit more value for money. The box ripped easily& as did the map. The compass fell apart and the belt doesn't stay closed and slides open. The sword and spyscope are really good and strong. My little boy was still happy with it all though so it's perfect for any little Jake fans..."
15835,4929,3," Lovely product and great for anyone who loves jake and dressing up. Disappointed over the size of the belt and bandana as my daughter was 2 1/2 and it didn't have much room for her to grow& considering it's for 3 plus it's rather small."
15836,4929,3," its ok& the map ripped really easily. the compass came apart too easily the sword and spy glass are quite good quality but the bandana is quite small made"
15837,4929,5," My son adores Jake and the Neverland pirates& so this accessories set is perfect. The items are all well made and will withstand the use from a pirate!"
15838,4929,3," Bought for Christmas as 4 year old son wanted it& he loves playing pirates with it so I'm happy although I think it's expensive for what it is."
15839,4930,4," This is a great pirate ship and my wee grandson loves it.  It did arrive with a piece broken but we managed to fix it ourselves but it was just lucky we decided to build it before we gave him it or we wouldn't have found the broken bit until Christmas morning.  Great service from the company though."
15840,4930,3," A nice figure but far too small for the Barbarossa pirate ship. Does not go with the budkins pirate figures as I was expecting. Bought as a gift but disappointed with size."
15841,4930,5," Just the job the Grandchildren love it every time they get the Pirate ships out they enjoy playing with the Barbarossa's we had to buy Two to keep them happy."
15842,4931,5," WELL MADE-  WELL PRICED - AND THE CHILDREN LOVED IT THANK YOU"
15843,4932,5," Really pleased we bought this cut out.  Used it as a prop for a pirate themed party& and kids and adults alike loved the idea.  Lots of fun photos taken. The image& colours and detail are great.  The cardboard for the cut out itself is also of a good quality.  The size of the cut out was just right.  The stand works& but care needs to be taken not to lean against the cut out."
15844,4932,5," Lovely& great height for the children& sturdier than I thought however my original plan was to set it up outside but it was pretty windy and they are only card! But indoors they survived the whole evening even with the kids pulling them and leaning on them! Looked great!"
15845,4932,4," Returned first as arrived faulty& second came perfect and really quickly& kids loved it"
15846,4932,5," Arrived on time. Perfect size for kids. Good sturdy cardboard"
15847,4933,5," Good fun just what I needed for my pirate themed party. Easy to assemble and looks the business& well done."
15848,4933,5," Excellent quality"
15849,4933,5," Got this as a present for a friend& I've not seen it yet so can't comment on the quality of it but my friend says she loves it."
15850,4934,5," My little fella loves his pirates and is in love with animals of all kinds& but especially of the sea.I was certain he'd love it& and when i gave it him his face was a picture.He's got the big pirate ship and the ghost pirate boat already and a twelve strong crew of goodies and baddies& so this |ghost pirate monster crab| tops it off.Hours of fun for us both!!When he comes and says to me |Daddy& i want to play pirates& i finish what i'm doing and it's straight to the living room rug!!!A great toy &but really good for the price.I'm working away so next time i go home it'll be the |Ghost pirate Stingray| i'll be taking home.Thanks Playmobil& from Daddy Pirate"
15851,4934,5," As usual playmobil toy made to a very high standard. Has had hours of fun with this present already. Would be ideal if more sea themed playmobil toys"
15852,4934,4," Grandchildren loved it"
15853,4934,5," Grandson loved it"
15854,4935,5," I got this for my nephew's 3rd birthday. He and my other little nephew love it.I found the assembly a bit tricky but a family friend helped me and he had it assembled really quickly. You need a small phillips head screw driver for the assembly as there are some screws that you need to fix.The kids were surprised that there were no pirate figures with the ship but I was expecting this and had bought some separate. Initially I thought that this was quite an expensive present for what it was but after seeing how much the kids like it and watching them play with it& it seems good value for money.I would definitely recommend this as a gift for little boys."
15855,4935,5," Really good solid wooden pirate ship and far better than any 5 minute plastic production line wonder. My 4 year old lad loves it. Some assembly needed with the mast but very durable and playable. Much better to have some really decent imagination inspiring toys like this than kids sitting in front of the box all day long."
15856,4935,5," Was really pleased with this pirate ship.  Its very well made and the dramatic colouring makes it interesting to small children.  My 3-year old grandson plays with the cannon and really likes it.  Would recommend."
15857,4935,5," We had a pirate themed party for our son's 2nd birthday and his godmother got him this quite brilliant pirate ship which is still plucked out from the toy mountain regularly now he's 3 and a bit.  It's lasted some inventive and occasionally excessively rough play pretty well and the odd new pirate addition every now and then (as well as the odd Star Wars character) has definitely made this a firm favourite with my little one.  Would heartily recommend! [see what I did there...]"
15858,4935,4," Lovely wooden ship& good quality& looks like it will last well. Lots of nice design features such as anchor on a winch& gangplank& deck cannon which fires large wooden cannonballs (which appear compatible with the Le Toy Van Trebuchet)& stern opens easily to put stuff inside the ship. My little lad is very pleased with it. And it looks nice& too."
15859,4935,4," This is a beautiful toy& my only complaints are that the screw supplied for the crow's nest isn't long enough"
15860,4935,5," My daughter is 8 but she was given this toy when she was 6. I can't say that she's played with it every day& but it is a solid toy with lots of fun elements that can be used with many different toys. Le Toy Van pirates& My Little Ponys and Scooby Doo characters have all been captured in the hold! I did a lot of research before she got it and I can pretty confidently say that this is at least one of the best wooden pirate ships available& if not the best. I would not recommend this for a child under 4& and it really depends on hos hard your child is on their toys. Still& it is very sturdy - sometimes the sails can come loose - particularly the front one& and one of the flag poles might get broken (though I think in our case it was an adult that did that!) - but the sails can be put back and the fiddly flag poles may just get in the way of the fun."
15861,4935,4," I bought this for my 4 year old& who is pretty heavy handed to say the least. He loves it and has spent hours playing with it& and it is still in tact!Its a really well designed toy& with lots of bits to fire his imagination.Would have been even better if it came with some pirates& but I found some little wooden ones easily to go with it."
15862,4936,5," What a fantastic product to review.  The first thing that strikes you is the sheer size of the box.  It's huge.  The ship must be about 60 cm in length.  Don't throw away the polystyrene like I nearly did - it's there to ensure the ship floats even if waterlogged.Assembly is tricky.  I'd expect adult supervision even for a ten year old.  It takes about half an hour to put together and you'll need a small screwdriver and attention to detail as the instructions are a little fiddly at best.  The stickers will always need an adult to help with& and possibly some handy tweezers.Once together you can tell this is built to classic Playmobil quality.  It's got a feel of being able to last forever& even with the small parts our 4 year old would struggle to damage the ship.  This is no mean feat as some parts are thin& but it's so well designed that even with these parts you can tell it's still strong.There's so much detail with the ship - 4 sails (plastic laminated card)& rope netting (plastic)& a working anchor& 3 flags& crows nest& 2 cannons& 3 pirates& and lots more.The sails move& there's a treasure cargo area with folding gate& the ship's wheel moves& and the 3 pirates have a host of mean looking weapons to fuel imagination (or take them away!).  There is even a cheeky monkey who likes clinging to the structure.  Perhaps the most fun will be the two firing cannons& capable of launching the 'balls' a good 5 feet. A big hit with our boy.Yes& the ship does float!  We had loads of fun at bathtime with this.  You can buy a motor if you feel brave enough to set sail.  ...Read more â€º"
15863,4936,5," Like all Playmobil sets& this Floating Pirate Raidersâ€™ Ship needs to be constructed.  This can be fiddly& although& luckily& my son loves making things like this and volunteered to put it together.  However& it does take a while and so& if you have children who are likely to be disappointed if they cannot play with a toy as soon as it is taken from the box& it might be a good idea to make it first and then present it to them.  For other children& of course& making the toy is as much fun as playing with it and so you can decide for yourself.  On the plus side& the instruction booklet is excellent& the parts well made and the stickers good quality.Once made& you get a large pirate ship which can either be moved via wheels or can float on water â€“ and it floats well& without tipping.  You can get lots of Playmobil pirate sets"
15864,4936,5," Playmobil is one of those manufacturers you can buy from knowing what you buy will be a quality toy. It is constructive and helps with creative play. It makes the imagination work. It gets the children off their electronic devices. My daughter has lots of Playmobil and she has had and will have hours and hours of fun with it. She was delighted to receive the pirate ship. It takes a bit of time to build. My daughter did most of it and I only helped when called upon for the more fiddly bits and the stickers. The instructions are clear. The finished product looks great. The anchor and canon work. It really does float.  Just the toy for those that love jack Sparrow. I have no hesitation in recommending Playmobil or this pirate ship for 4 years old upwards (I would suggest). It's great."
15865,4936,5," As with others of their bigger sets& the initial construction can be somewhat challenging for a smaller child& and adult supervision is needed.  Having said that& the instructions are clear and the parts well designed& so it all goes together very satisfyingly.  Please note that the shaped polystyrene is not packaging - it is flotation to put inside the hull.  There is an excellent speeded-up video on the playmobil.de site (search for Playmobil 6678) which shows the whole construction& if you want to get an idea.Unlike Lego& once the set is built& you will not be taking the hull apart and building again - it's a one-time thing.  But the masts are removable (they simply turn and click into place) so this helps a little with storing the finished ship.  In general& I would say it is all very strong and robust& with the possible exception of the sails.  These are held in place by thin plastic fixings& which might not survive really rough treatment& but are fine for normal use.Often with Playmobil you get absolutely masses of little bits and pieces to support imaginative play thereafter.  In this case& the ship itself is the star - including working cannons& which fire little foam-tipped darts& and a functioning anchor which you can winch up and down.  Apart from this& you get 3 characters (2 pirate men and one pirate woman - good!) with swords& belts& hats& etc. - and a little ship's monkey to climb the rigging.Playmobil can sometimes be achingly twee and sweet. Whilst hardly fearsome& this ship avoids this - and manages to look imposing and piratical& greatly assisted by the black sails& and massive skull and crossbones on the main sail.  If your child is very taken with this (i.e.Read more â€º"
15866,4937,4," This game is great for kids. It's bright& it's fun& it's edgey (pirates!) it can entertain 2-4 at any one time. Bring it out when you're kids are having a party and it'll keep them quiet(ish) for a while.I found it to be durable& the only worry is losing some of the swords which may be too small for the very young (or old).There's no batteries = no extra cost and there's no staring at a screen. Great."
15867,4937,5," A game for all ages from 1 and half up& yet still just as entertaining and challenging for the 70 year olds! Just put in your blade to try to make the pirate pop up&or play the opposite& put in your blade and hope he doesn't! Colour coded blades allow for upto four players/teams. Different blade hole each time produces winner/loser. Excellent fun and totally fair."
15868,4937,5," We played this game recently in a group of 4 with ages ranging from 6-98 and I must admit that I hadn't played it for years.I was a bit skeptical at first however after about 15mins I (and many others) started to get into it.The product itself and the supporting accessories are made of very good quality material given the price point and is nicely presented with a durable and quality feel to it.The game itself is very easy to play and involves firstly lowering the pirate downwards as far as it goes and then distributing the swords evenly between all the players. Each player then takes it in turn to stick each sword into the barrel (stabbing the pirate in the process!) and the one that activates the sensitive spring mechanism will eject the pirate upwards and will be eliminated from the game. You then repeat the process and the person that manages to not activate it will remain and be declared the eventual winner.The barrel changes the location of the spring sensitive slot each time so you never know where it's new location will be.You can have between 2-4 players playing the game and we found that playing with 4 made the game a lot more effective.You can play it at varying speeds although my elderly relative tested our patience on a number of occasions& especially when he was declared the winner!. My 6 year old cousin really enjoyed it and although this game targets the 4-8 age group& we found that it's a game that can be played by a wide range of people from all ages (above 4 ideally) from a number of different backgrounds. It was Exciting& Tense and A Barrel Of Fun.Read more â€º"
15869,4937,5," I saw this game originally on the UK show Supernanny. She had explained how much fun it is to play this as a family. I went ahead and purchased this and it is by far the funnest family game for my 2 and 4 yr old daughters. They absolutely love putting the swords in and seeing who can pop up the pirate first. Although I think the objest is to see who can last thelongest w/o popping the pirate. It is much more fun for my kids when the winner pops the pirate. I highly recommend this for anyone who is looking for a few laughs and quality time w/their kids."
15870,4937,5," this is a great toy and helped a lot in teaching my 3 year old daughter about taking turns and waiting for your own turn. Its very funny when the pirate pops up& and you can change the rules to make it that you have won& or you are out& when he pops up. Its easy for a young child to stick the swords in the barrel& you sometimes have to hold it steady but overall the toy is quite robust. Also my daughter liked counting all the swords and sorting them into different coloured piles. Overall a great family game that they dont get bored of."
15871,4937,1," Terrible product as this is a counterfeit item received by myself and many other customers on a bargain buys forum. Tacky& cheaply made& doesn't look safe and breaks immediately. Avoid at all cost& this is not a genuine product and looks nothing like the picture!!!"
15872,4937,5," I think this is a great game. You can play it with quite a few players or a child on their own can enjoy seeing how long until the pirate pops up. It's still fun to play as an adult. I have bought a couple of these now as gifts and they have been well received."
15873,4937,5," Bought this for my 3 year old nephew for xmas but my three o'clock everyone from my ten year old son to my 85 year old grandma had had a go!A really fun& simple game that doesn't require any tricky construction and is easy to use.A classic!"
15874,4938,5,""
15875,4938,4," My son is a massive Jake and The Neverland Pirates fan and so we got him his |Jake's Pirate Ship| for Christmas.  This was opened by a very (very is probably an understatement!) excited little boy at 3am in the morning as he woke up super early knowing it was Christmas and wouldn't settle till he went to see if Father Christmas had been.  Thank you Fisher price for making this one of the easiest toys to assemble and for already having the stickers attached as I was still half asleep putting it together and don't think I could have coped with a massive assembly job.  The assembly took under 5 minutes and is just taking the ship and pieces out of the box& attaching the crows nest to the mast& attaching the mast to the ship and finally attaching the sail and rigging - the easiest Christmas present we had.I have attached a video to this review showing the Mighty Colossus and all of it's features. There is also a photo slideshow at the end of the video part which starts just after the 6minute point should anyone wish to just look at the photo's of the Mighty Colossus rather than view the video.The Colossus measures approx 64cm/25 inches tall (to the top of the flag) by 52cm/20.5 inches long by 13.5cm/5 inches wide (at the widest wheel points).The Colossus has three main levels (two inside ship and the deck) and also the crows nest so four levels in total.  The rigging& sail and flag are removable although once you have attached the mast it cannot be removed which is a little bit of a nuisance for when packing it away and so a removable mast with some sort of lock for adult removal only would have been nice from a space perspective as the Colossus is huge!Read more â€º"
15876,4938,5," I almost didn't buy this as when i first looked it was Â£39.99 which i thought was to much. in the end it was the last present i bought for my kids when it went down to Â£29.99.  My 3 year old son has probably played with it more than any other present& he loves the fact that its on wheels and so far it has survived a week of him pushing it and shoving it around. He mainly enjoys taking the ladder and rigging on and off and using the cannon which fires the two pretend coconuts enough of a distance to keep him interested. It does have other features like a trap door and small cage to put lord fathom in but at present he's just happy pushing it around. There wasn't much to do to put it together which was a relief on christmas morning. I haven't given it five stars as still don't believe its worth more that Â£29.99."
15877,4938,4," Very happy with purchase. Ordered just before Christmas so I wasn't expecting quick delivery& however it arrived in less than 5 working days.The pirate ship itself is well made. Occasionally I find that these kind of toys are a bit flimsy and the opening parts can soon bend or fall off if played with by a rough child. There are a number of small parts which need attaching to the ship before completely assembled but this is easily done with guidance from the picture on the front of the box.The pirate ship comes with a jake character and a few other pirate related moveable toys to help play 'make believe' with such as a cannon.Overall I am pleased with the product and the seller. Speedy delivery& well made product and cheaper than other retailers by Â£10."
15878,4938,4," My 3 year old son is Mighty Colussus mad.  Couldnt bring ourselves to pay Â£40-50 for it but bought it for his birthday when it went down to Â£25.  We are now a month in from his birthday and he has played with it every day (as has his 4 year old brother).  Relatively sturdy.  Worth Â£25 but i still wouldn't pay Â£40+ for it"
15879,4938,5," Brought this for my 3 years old grandson who is captain jake mad and he loves it& plastic could be a bit stronger but he hasn't  left it alone since getting it"
15880,4938,4," Bought as a Christmas present for grandson.  In comparison with other J"
15881,4938,5," Not has great as you think for the money but got it cheaper anyway but my son is happy so that's all that matters"
15882,4939,5," Excellent... Recommended"
15883,4939,5," Great thank you"
15884,4940,4," Nice set with female pirate and lots of treasures. Functionality to flip treasures in open works well& but scorpions often don't hold in their places.Our 3 years old daughter likes this a lot."
15885,4941,5," Very good"
15886,4942,5," Excellent"
15887,4943,5," Arrived as requested. One very happy child is grateful."
15888,4944,5," These le toy van wooden firemen are fab....they are well made&have lovely little outfits and stand/pose very well....would recommend to any child over 3 years."
15889,4944,5," Lovely wooden firefighters from Le Toy Van. They are easy to manipulate to sit& stand and hold things. They have lovely faces and well made outfits. A perfect toy to go with the Le Toy Van fire station and fire engine."
15890,4944,5," I got this last year along with the fire station and fire engine for my then 2yr olds father christmas present last year... it really had quite the wow factor for christmas day.  He's 3 now and although it has never been his favourite toy (still plays more with brio train set and toot toot garage) he will play with it about once a week and now makes up role play stories about what is happening etc.  I like it as its wooden rather than plastic fantastic so its not such an eyesore as other toys& and actually looks like a rather attractive feature in the corner of our living room.  When friends come round to play they always gravitate towards it so it definitely has an appeal to 2-3yr olds at least and I anticipate it will continue to be played with for a few more years.  I imagine that it will be one that I store in the attic for the grandchildren to play with one day too! It is sturdy and has stood the test of time over the past year at least - looks as good as new really!"
15891,4944,5," These go so well with the y Van Le fire engine& and they are robust little characters have had them for a month now and no breakage yet  after heavy use with 3 little girls. Lots of detail and the hands hold all the equipment such as the hose pipes and axe from the fire engine. Fantastic and worth the money. Definitely going to buy Le toy Van products in the future. Well done Le Toy Van at last I've found a make of toys we all love!"
15892,4944,4," I received these toys today to accompany the toy Fire Station and Fire Engine I had also purchased made by the same company and was pleased when we opened them.  They are bendy and poseable and fit into the fire engine with ease& stand up well and don cute little costumes.  Durabilty& only time will tell I suppose& but would appear well made. My three-and-a-half year old son was delighted to have this as an after Christmas gift purchased with his Christmas money.We are happy with these toys and would recommend them although the price tag was a bit on the high side when bought with the station and the engine all separately."
15893,4944,3," Although these are great because they have easily movable joints I was really disappointed with the quality.  All the  hats came off and were impossible to stick back on as there was a considerable amount if glue already used. These were rather expensive fort he quality."
15894,4945,5," I have a care setting and brought it for different age ranges as well as boys and girls. The children from 3 years to 9 years all loved the figures and they have played for many hours with them. Would recomend it to every one"
15895,4945,5," As described and arrived promptly&"
15896,4946,4," Bought this at a good lower price on amazon& which made this a really good gift. Son loves the teeth like prison to front& not alot too it for a full price& but its fun an great for the child& i recommend!!"
15897,4946,5," Great has been played with loads by my two grandsons. Sturdy and lots of features. I would recommend to children who like Jake the Pirate lots of play value."
15898,4946,5," i chose this rating because i knew i grand son would love this toy .i would recommend this toy to family and friend"
15899,4946,5," This is a fairly simple plastic toy& yet it is safe to conclusively say that my 5yr old Jake fan loves it. It comes with Peter Pan which made it extra appealing for him and it has added to the ton of Jake toys we have so that they have more hideouts and islands to visit."
15900,4946,5," GREAT price just had to get it... at least double the price everywhere else ...is bigger than I expected but that's not a bad thing looks quite study and well made ..my son is going to love it !!"
15901,4946,3," doesn't do much& my little boy has most everything out of this range and I think he would happily do without this bit...although he likes having the figure"
15902,4946,5," Really pleased with this item& just the present I was looking for my godson's birthday. The size of the product will be perfect for him to play with."
15903,4946,5," Quite strong and easily put away into the toy box. Not as big as the other Jake playsets but perfect for little fans of Jake. Well worth the money."
15904,4947,1," Very poor quality toy& very flimsy and might as well be made of paper. The sails are tied on with a little piece of string and do not stay on and its made of very cheap plastic. Save your money and dont buy. My kids got it for Christmas and its only good for the rubbish bin now."
15905,4947,3," does not float all the time had to take sails off"
15906,4947,2," Quite disappointed with this. I think my son is a little older than its designed audience however the same problems are relevant. It floats well& but doesn't balance unless all pieces are removed. Patrick is very difficult for small hands to use the squity feature. The sails and other accessories are constantly falling off. It's a very poor design for a children's toy when what is wrong with it could have been so easily rectified."
15907,4947,4," Took some assembling at times a little awkward. But my brothers loved this gift and have great fun with it."
15908,4947,3," It was Ok. It has lasted well but does not hold upvery well in play. Needs constant putting together"
15909,4947,5," Great Price a lot larger than i thought it would be really happy and my 5 year old will love this on christmas morning!!Great service all round great very happy!"
15910,4947,2," Very disappointed very flimsy and everything falls off it . Really not great but the see characters are good"
15911,4947,5," Fast delivery got it when it said it would my boy loves it and got it before his birthday would recommend it"
15912,4948,5," Excellent..... Recommended"
15913,4949,4," I purchased this toy for my son's birthday. It was very quick to assemble and put on the necessaary stickers and has now been played with constantly. He is actually learning about egyptians at the moment at school so this is brilliant for him to re-enact all the scenes he is learning about. Playmobil is an excellent quality toy& many years ago I purchased the knights and castle sets for my eldest son and they are still being played with to death by my youngest. Nothing snaps& breaks or becomes discoloured& it is expensive stuff but most definitely worth it."
15914,4949,4," Excellent quality& floats really well in the bath.  A bit fiddly to construct though& but solid and durable once achieved"
15915,4949,5," Brilliant& my son loved it to complete his Egyptian playmobil set.Would definitely recommend though a little dear but I believe that the Egyptian playmobils are difficult to find nowadays."
15916,4949,5," My grandson loved this as his birthday present"
15917,4949,5," Very happy thank you"
15918,4950,5," It was a gift for my friend's baby boy. He loves pirates... Toy has a lot of pirate accessories as seen in the photo that makes it fun"
15919,4950,4," My 5yr old grandson loved it&  just one small part missing but wrote to Playmobil and they sent the part to me."
15920,4950,4," Excellent product added at good price to pirate ship and soldiers ship purchased."
15921,4950,5," great price for playmobil and great addition for other pirate sets."
15922,4950,4," Lots of small pieces but compliments the other toys in the range."
15923,4950,4," Kids loved this& small pieces can irritate me however."
15924,4950,5," Arrived well ahead of ETA. Thank you."
15925,4950,5," Lovely item and super quick delivery"
15926,4951,5," I have never liked buying plastic toys as most are flimsy"
15927,4951,5," My 7 year old bought this with money he'd saved up and was not disappointed when it arrived. He needed some help first setting it up out of the box but has spent hours playing with this. He'd spotted it in a local supermarket and was Â£10 cheaper from Amazon so was a bargain to boot! My only warning would be he's now wanting more from the range and I'm looking at the fairy and princess sets for my youngest daughter. Apparently Playmobil is addictive stuff!!! Great quality and lots of imaginative play!"
15928,4951,4," Kids loved assembling the product. But some part of it was tedious. The plastic is okay& but not fantastic.In fact the plastic on the back of the male pirate got broken when I tried to fit in one of the swords. Then we realized that the paraphernelia provided will not fit in and some are expected to be kept loose in the ship. This is a bit awkard while actually using it in bathtub (hoping it does not get lost)! But I think this was intended idea& to have things strewn around& like in real ship and the characters are kind of |not-fixed| action figures as well.The canon looks to be spring based and simple. The rudder is not working piece. This could have been modified to be a steering wheel instead to provide more pirate-y feel!"
15929,4951,5," Really good buy for my grandsons aged 5 and 4. I bought it along with the large pirate ship which is great. Lots for them to play with and very good for imaginative play."
15930,4951,5," Awesome ship and usual Playmobil quality and attention to detail. We bought extra pirates& also fantastic& so we have a full crew. My 3 year old loved it& but the age guide is due to some very small fiddly bits& eg cuffs of pirate jackets that probably need adult help or supervision possibly up to age 5. We spent an hour assembling it on Christmas morning& which was fun but a little tricky to stop them being swiped before we'd got the smaller parts fixed on."
15931,4951,5," just what my grandson wanted"
15932,4951,4," Usual great quality you can rely on from Playmobil. Bought as a gift for a friend's son& who apparently loves to play with it in the bath! Good to find something for slightly older kids to play with at bath time& as most bath toys&are aimed at younger kids and babies& so this went down a storm. Recommended purchase."
15933,4951,5," Bought as a gift for my nephew& very pleased with the bargain. My own son is now extremely jealous and demands the same gift! Lovely set of figures and accessories but not for very small children as lots of small accessories."
15934,4952,5," Very good quality< I hadn't realised that one of the pieces was an eyepatch so not as many pirates as I expected."
15935,4952,4," DIFFICULT TO FIND A GROUP OF PIRATES& WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE THE PIRATE SHIP. GRANDSON DELIGHTED"
15936,4952,5," My grandson has had great fun with the pirates and brilliant for the price. He puts them in water and they have held their super colours."
15937,4953,5," I live in the US and I was so excited to see that you carry these amazing Pippi toys and that it was so easy to have them shipped to us. My daughters love Pippi and she is still popular here but you can't find these toys anywhere. They are well-made and adorable! I feel like they are durable enough to pass on to our grandchildren someday."
15938,4953,5," very nice thanx :-)"
15939,4954,5," This playmat is excellent quality. It has a thick rubber backing which looks like it will be very durable and the top is felt (I think!) which looks easy enough to keep clean. There are alot of great little details such as sharks in the water& skulls and buried treasure which will really keep kids busy and their imagination racing. It's bigger than most playmats I've seen and could possibly double as a bedroom rug. As it is so big it there is plenty of room for siblings or friends to play too. I've bought this for my son's Christmas to go with his Playmobil pirate sets& and although he hasn't seen it yet I have absolutley no doubt he will love it. I've recommended it to friends who seem keen to get one for their sons and I would definitely recommend it to any playful pirates out there!"
15940,4954,4," I bought this playmat for use with le toy van pirate ship& it is perfect for stimulating imagination and has been constantly in use.  The one problem with it is that it has |bobbled| quite a bit."
15941,4954,5," thought this was really good&my grandson wanted it to play on with his figures and we have had many adventures on this mat.very colourful and good value fro money as you can use it time after time."
15942,4954,5," Treasure island my little grandson has a great time playing with his pirates and boats on the mat would recommend."
15943,4954,5," It is a great quality and a good size mat for using with a pirate ship. My 4 year old nephew enjoys using it."
15944,4954,5," Fabulous for any child who likes playing with pirate toys - adds an extra dimension to imaginative play."
15945,4954,4," good large map and fairly good quality - we are using it with pirate playmobil and works well"
15946,4955,3," Pirates and boat are great product well made. My critism of the carry case is that they are no compartments and nothing to stop everything from falling out if not opened correctly. Everything gets muddled up. it would be nice if it were more organised."
15947,4955,5," My little boy loves this and the fact it in a little case is good means it can be kept nice or carried about with him."
15948,4955,5," Brilliant product! Brought for my niece who has already had hours of enjoyment. Her older sister loves it too!The cannon is a lot better than I expected and they really enjoy trying to fire it at me. Would recommend it to anyone who has kids who love to play& imagine and laugh!"
15949,4955,5," Great toy ! My son has hours of fun with it so much so that I gave it to my nephew as a birthday present.It is of good quality and you can keep on adding pieces to create a whole world of pirates & endless hours of fun."
15950,4955,5," brilliant idea by Playmobil. A toy in its own carrycase. Great for kids when they want to either take toys to their pals houses or for that sleepover! the case is very well made& sturdy and holds an amazing amount of figures. my son uses the 2 he has to store all his figures and the small accessories he has in his Playmobil collection"
15951,4955,5," The carrying case is really handy to tidy it all away. Its got lots of little pieces so need to be careful around really little children. Both my kids love it. Good value for money"
15952,4955,5," I am very impressed with Playmobil and this 'carrying Case' is no exception. Great quality& plenty of goodies and hours of fun for my little boy. Highly recommend it."
15953,4955,4," Good present for young boys who like pirates. Firing the canon and retrieving the canonball great fun for my little boy! Item arrived on time and in excellent condition. Carrying case good idea. One word of warning: lots of tiny pieces& so don't buy if babies in the house!"
15954,4956,5," Delighted with speedy undamaged arrival of set of handsome pirates.Had a quick play before handing over to grandson 5yrs who was as enchanted as I was [65yrs].Was a welcome distraction from christmas domestic and culinary duties.Yours in appreciationPeter Pan"
15955,4956,5," These are great!  My 4 yr old daughter asked for a pirate ship for Christmas.  A lot of the ships and pirates looked too violent and were made of plastic.  These are wooden and well constructed.  Their limbs move enough that they can ride her little Schleich horses.  Most of their clothes are well attached.  She is able to get the vest off of one.  I bought this set since I thought the long brown haired one was a girl& but it turns out he has facial stubble.  It would have been an added plus if they had a girl pirate& but you can't have everything right?"
15956,4956,5," Bought these to go with the wooden pirate ship I purchased from Amazon. They are absolutely perfect& well made& lots of lovely details& and very durable - my boisterous 9 month old takes them off his 3 year old brother and even he can't destroy them! They really are a great buy!"
15957,4956,4," have a pirate mad 4 year old that needed men for an empty ship. All the men look the part with outfits &hats and hair.we were very happy"
15958,4956,4," This set of six bendy dolls was bought as a result of an Amazon |deal| (people who buy <this> often buy <this> and <this> - buy them together for <Â£xxxxx>).I'm ever so glad I decided to buy them as they make a great accompaniment to the Barbarrosa wooden pirate ship we got for my son for Christmas.The wooden figurines are full of character and allow for great make-believe play. They seem pretty durable (although they haven't been in circulation for long and may still not withstand the test of time...)They have each been given a name - Captain& Dre& Chris& Jake& Nick and Nack (?!) and each one has a job on the boat (Nick's job is to fire the cannon& Nac's job is to be sick with the flu& Dre is the fighter& Chris is the cook& Jake is the ship's boy and Captain is& erm& the Captain).They have great faces and nice clothes and fab woolly hair (apart from the bald one!)I'd recommend them highly! We've had so much fun with them thus far."
15959,4956,5," Bought these to go with my son's Le Van pirate ship. He loves them - as they bend& they can hold on to the rigging& turn the ship's wheel and walk the plank!  A nice change to his plastic Lego people and they fit perfectly in/on the ship."
15960,4956,5," Bought these pirates for my son's 3rd birthday in May to go with the pirate ship and he loves them. They showed some other pirates (bought seperatly) with the ship but thought they looked like they was for an older boy.  So glad with this decision as there isn't a day he goes without playing with them.  He calls one of them Mr Smee and one captain Hook from Peter Pan.  As you can see they are educational as he is using his imagination a lot. Great durability will last for a long time."
15961,4956,5," Lovely traditional figures when they arrived they were even better than what I thought the online picture doesn't show how nice they really are"
15962,4957,5," Love this!  Good quality Papo figure& approximately 8 cms tall.  Lovely detail includes little gold buckles on the shoes& a spotty waist sash and even has painted on gold earrings. Axe and sword are not removable which may be a plus factor if purchasing for young children."
15963,4958,2," I ordered the pirate set for my grandson as he had a pirate ship for xmas but no pirates came with it he loves Scooby doo so this was perfect was not happy when it arrived today to find  mystery mates instead of pirate crew could not take them off my grandson once he saw them so still need to buy pirates which is going to cost more money"
15964,4958,5," Figures look like the cartoon characters and my son will love this on Christmas to go with the Scooby Doo Pirate DVD"
15965,4958,5," great addition to scooby doo figures& my 4yr old loves them xx"
15966,4959,5," great item and wonderful customer service from the seller. thank you."
15967,4959,5," Xmas present for godson. He loved it!"
15968,4960,5," goes perfect with Queen Ann's Revenge Pirate ship& which was bought at the same time. Nice figure with useful accessories - bought for 11yr old son"
15969,4961,5," Very nicely made and a great addition to other figures that my son already had. We love the quality of all the figures from this range."
15970,4961,5," Lovely peg-leg pirate from Papo.  Excellent quality& lovely colours and excellent detail."
15971,4961,5," My grandson loves his pirates."
15972,4962,5," I love (as do my children!) all Papo figures&you really do get what you pay for here&so do spend those extra few pennies because these figures will last your children forever&their own grandchildren will be playing with them in years to come&they don't break&they withstand a little teething if the baby gets hold of them and with a little imagination will fuel your child's play tin for hours and hours.... My son now 18 has just given all his papo knights to his younger cousin&they are still as new starting their second round of adventures!"
15973,4962,5," What every little boy wants& a reallyScary character& I get them for my grandson Freddie& he is into knights and pirates& at the moment."
15974,4962,5," Detail is excellent. A good sturdy toy."
15975,4963,5," A smurf figure& just like the picture shows& thanks."
15976,4963,5," Excellent"
15977,4964,5," My LO loves playing with this. He got it for Xmas when 2 1/2 and 6 months later is still playing with it nearly every day."
15978,4964,5," My son hit this 4 months ago and still won't leave it alone it's one off the better take n play sets"
15979,4964,5," Nice toy & my daughter loves to play with."
15980,4964,5," great grandson loved it he now has two"
15981,4964,4," Thank You"
15982,4965,4," I bought this item for my 4yrs old grandson who just loves all things pirate.  The look on his face when he received it was a picture and he played for hours on the very first day& he even took it up to bed with him.  It is reasonably well constructed with lots of small additions such as a treasure chest& crocodile& extra cannons etc.  There are two figures in the set& one a pirate and one a monster figure.  These figures are too large to be placed on the pirate ship and the set would certainly have benefitted from a few small pirate figures who could man the ship. The ship is made from brittle plastic and probably will not take too much rough handling.When the pirate ship was delivered I didn't initially notice that some parts were missing.  Luckily I later spotted that the deck railings and ships steering wheel were missing.  The ship comes boxed& with most of the accessories contained within the bubble pack& but not the rear part of the ship.  Fortunately I had not handed the ship to my grandson and I was able to return it to Amazon and send for a second one which arrived in perfect condition.Overall it is a case of 'You get what you pay for'.  Having said that&  this is a low priced item that offers a lot of happy playtime for any child.  I am glad that I bought it."
15983,4965,4," I got this pirate ship for a snip b4 christmas he loves it its got the works even a crocodile ! what more could a 6yr old boy ask for gives hours of imaginative play on his own or with friends"
15984,4965,1," This was a present from a friend who does not have children. It broke really quickly and now I have to buy a more expensive one. Cheap tat."
15985,4965,4," Good product but was a bit smaller than expected but my nephew loved it so I'm happy. But i will say the pirates were a bit big to play on this ship but would recommend it still."
15986,4965,4," This product& despite its small pieces& comes with a vast range of accessories& and the children love to play with them. they are often asked for at playgroup"
15987,4965,5," good quality for price& my son loves pirates so he loved this i have also bought other pirate play product that have been brilliant"
15988,4965,3," The product itself feels quite cheap like it would break easily but my nephew loves it and it seems to be holding up so far."
15989,4966,5," I brought this toy for my daughter as she loves pirates of the caribbean and she loved the toy. good for pirate fans its a good size not to small."
15990,4967,5," These are so cute& my 3 and 4 year old girls are Pippi obsessed and we got them these as well as pirate pippi..money well spent!"
15991,4967,5," very nice thanx :-)"
15992,4967,5," Good product"
15993,4968,4," These are fab and my son loves them! If the bucket was better attached it would be better as it is already lost. Admittedly my so doesn't seem to mind as he loves them so much!"
15994,4968,5," The figures are a good size and well designed for a young child. Each figure has enough interest to engage the child in learning about the characters and their different roles on a pirate ship.I think the small pieces like the the sword&are fine for a sensible young child who is told not to put them in his/her mouth and obeys instructions. Some parental supervision when the child first receives the toy will help with the child's imaginative play with the figures. These figures combine well with Le Toy Van Barbarossa Pirate Ship."
15995,4968,3," i love the ToyVan ranges but THEY JUST DONT LAST. They're made to look at not to play with. Everything in my daughters Doll House is broken and my sons Pirate ship and Castle are not faring much better. The little figurines don't seem to interest the kids as much as figures by other brands."
15996,4968,4," I had to buy these to add to the pirate ship I gave my grandson for his fourth birthday.  He loved the ship and was even happier once the pirates went on board."
15997,4968,5," Bought these figures to go with the Le Toy Van Ghost ship I bought for my kids. All in all very happy with them& really detailed and well made. Unfortunately the bucket doesnt stay in the deck-hand's hand at all so my daughter got a bit annoyed with that and also he has a leather belt that doesnt stay on either. Im getting the superglue out tonight to fix the problem :)"
15998,4968,4," Bought for my three year old nephew to go with a pirate ship.  These are cute little figures& very well dressedand good characters."
15999,4968,5," A lovely set of figures to complement the Barbarossa pirate ship. Lots of play value and items as described& colourful costumes."
16000,4968,5," Provides hours of game play with the pirate ship.  Another world is created with these& for young children.  They loved them."
16001,4969,5," What a fantastic product to review.  The first thing that strikes you is the sheer size of the box.  It's huge.  The ship must be about 60 cm in length.  Don't throw away the polystyrene like I nearly did - it's there to ensure the ship floats even if waterlogged.Assembly is tricky.  I'd expect adult supervision even for a ten year old.  It takes about half an hour to put together and you'll need a small screwdriver and attention to detail as the instructions are a little fiddly at best.  The stickers will always need an adult to help with& and possibly some handy tweezers.Once together you can tell this is built to classic Playmobil quality.  It's got a feel of being able to last forever& even with the small parts our 4 year old would struggle to damage the ship.  This is no mean feat as some parts are thin& but it's so well designed that even with these parts you can tell it's still strong.There's so much detail with the ship - 4 sails (plastic laminated card)& rope netting (plastic)& a working anchor& 3 flags& crows nest& 2 cannons& 3 pirates& and lots more.The sails move& there's a treasure cargo area with folding gate& the ship's wheel moves& and the 3 pirates have a host of mean looking weapons to fuel imagination (or take them away!).  There is even a cheeky monkey who likes clinging to the structure.  Perhaps the most fun will be the two firing cannons& capable of launching the 'balls' a good 5 feet. A big hit with our boy.Yes& the ship does float!  We had loads of fun at bathtime with this.  You can buy a motor if you feel brave enough to set sail.  Playmobil 5536 Summer Fun RC Underwater Motor.I have to say this is a brilliant model ship.  Loads of features& loads of fun& and it should keep our boy entertained for months if not years.  I cannot find fault with anything. Excellent."
16002,4969,5," Like all Playmobil sets& this Floating Pirate Raidersâ€™ Ship needs to be constructed.  This can be fiddly& although& luckily& my son loves making things like this and volunteered to put it together.  However& it does take a while and so& if you have children who are likely to be disappointed if they cannot play with a toy as soon as it is taken from the box& it might be a good idea to make it first and then present it to them.  For other children& of course& making the toy is as much fun as playing with it and so you can decide for yourself.  On the plus side& the instruction booklet is excellent& the parts well made and the stickers good quality.Once made& you get a large pirate ship which can either be moved via wheels or can float on water â€“ and it floats well& without tipping.  You can get lots of Playmobil pirate sets"
16003,4969,5," Playmobil is one of those manufacturers you can buy from knowing what you buy will be a quality toy. It is constructive and helps with creative play. It makes the imagination work. It gets the children off their electronic devices. My daughter has lots of Playmobil and she has had and will have hours and hours of fun with it. She was delighted to receive the pirate ship. It takes a bit of time to build. My daughter did most of it and I only helped when called upon for the more fiddly bits and the stickers. The instructions are clear. The finished product looks great. The anchor and canon work. It really does float.  Just the toy for those that love jack Sparrow. I have no hesitation in recommending Playmobil or this pirate ship for 4 years old upwards (I would suggest). It's great."
16004,4969,5," As with others of their bigger sets& the initial construction can be somewhat challenging for a smaller child& and adult supervision is needed.  Having said that& the instructions are clear and the parts well designed& so it all goes together very satisfyingly.  Please note that the shaped polystyrene is not packaging - it is flotation to put inside the hull.  There is an excellent speeded-up video on the playmobil.de site (search for Playmobil 6678) which shows the whole construction& if you want to get an idea.Unlike Lego& once the set is built& you will not be taking the hull apart and building again - it's a one-time thing.  But the masts are removable (they simply turn and click into place) so this helps a little with storing the finished ship.  In general& I would say it is all very strong and robust& with the possible exception of the sails.  These are held in place by thin plastic fixings& which might not survive really rough treatment& but are fine for normal use.Often with Playmobil you get absolutely masses of little bits and pieces to support imaginative play thereafter.  In this case& the ship itself is the star - including working cannons& which fire little foam-tipped darts& and a functioning anchor which you can winch up and down.  Apart from this& you get 3 characters (2 pirate men and one pirate woman - good!) with swords& belts& hats& etc. - and a little ship's monkey to climb the rigging.Playmobil can sometimes be achingly twee and sweet. Whilst hardly fearsome& this ship avoids this - and manages to look imposing and piratical& greatly assisted by the black sails& and massive skull and crossbones on the main sail.  If your child is very taken with this (i.e.Read more â€º"
16005,4970,5," Great fun. The cannon does fire and can go a fair distance. Lots of bits& Gun& sword& flame& bucket etc"
16006,4970,5," A fantastic addition to the play mobile ship and accessories Father Christmas brought. The working cannon has provided hours of fun and imaginative role play."
16007,4970,5," This is a good toy that my grandson loves playing with.Have bought other items in same theme and they all fit in with each other."
16008,4970,5," Both grand children enjoyed playing with both cannon and Redcoat man."
16009,4970,3," okay as a stocking filler for Xmas."
16010,4970,5," A good little pocket money toy."
16011,4971,4," Got this while on special offer& so no gripes about its value.  Says quite a few phrases& which of course& is going to be adored by all Jake fans.  The only thing though& there are splits all over it& especially down the side of his head& so you can quite clearly see where it's all been put together& so it really doesn't look that good.  Happy with it at Â£8.99& wouldn't have been so happy to have paid RRP Â£19.99 though."
16012,4971,4," Bought for my 5 year old granddaughter who was very pleased to get it.Substantial talking figure from the television programme."
16013,4971,5," My Grandson really likes this toy & his best birthday pressie ever he says and he gets plenty of pressies from the family."
16014,4971,5," My grandson is mad on jake and the neverland pirates& he loved this gift& fantastic price& well worth it& excellent value for the money and bigger than i thought. would recommend"
16015,4971,5," amazing. my boy saw it in the disney store a few days before i got it n it was Â£15 in there but Â£8.99 on HERE. love it!"
16016,4971,5," It is a very good Jake for a little boy who watches Jake all the time on the tv& he knows all the songs and was made up that Jake says some of the same things he does on the programmes."
16017,4971,5," My son loves this toy he won't put it down ( so definitely got my pennies worth) I'm really happy with it as well it keeps my son entertained and my 5 year old daughter :)"
16018,4971,5," Jake and the never land pirates. Just as advertised& well made& sturdy and talks. Bought as a gift for a three year old"
16019,4972,5," Our grand children love this they have a great deal of fun when they get the other Figurines out would recommend."
16020,4972,5," Bought for a wee joke for a cake. I was afraid it wud b too big but it was perfect."
16021,4972,5," Came very quickly& brought for grandson who loved it&"
16022,4972,5," My grandson loves his pirates."
16023,4972,5," Would recommend"
16024,4973,5," a very good buy& these will last for years and played by all."
16025,4973,4," This cannon works well& I'm pleased with it"
16026,4973,5," I bought this to go with pirate carry case. Great extra to give or as toy on its own. Lots of fun to be had here as it is limited only by child's imagination."
16027,4973,5," My almost 3yo loves this& just have to keep an eye the cannonballs don't get lost as they shoot pretty far!"
16028,4973,4," Kids loved this& small pieces can irritate me however."
16029,4974,5," i bought it for my niece for Christmas and she was dancing round the room giving it large well made and very easy for children to use"
16030,4974,5," Very simple little kids guitar toy for Jake and the pirates fans the kids love this and the telescope you can also get"
16031,4974,5," My 2 year old absolutely loves this& easy to use and great tunes."
16032,4974,5," Bought for grandson.  Loves it.  Very nice little guitar."
16033,4975,5," I bought this for my sons 4th birthday& it was quite fiddly to assemble but I enjoy that kind of thing. He absolutely loves it& lots of different bits and pieces on it to play with. We've definitely had our moneys worth due to the amount of hours he's spent with it. We then went on to buy him the playmobile fort so he sets up battles between the two. My eight year old son also plays with it though not as much.  Very durable& taken a lot of rough play! Would recommend to all little pirate fans."
16034,4975,5," Excellent product let down only by card sails which would get ruined if the ship were used in water. I made some plastic sails from a morrisons bag for life using the paper sails as a template (see my customer image at top of page)."
16035,4975,4," Having read the reviews for this& I decided to put it together prior to Christmas morning rather than attempt it on the big day. I am so glad I did as it took my husband and I a good couple of hours of arguing over which bit goes where. My son was thrilled to bits with it and has played with it loads. I just wish they would make things themselves before selling them as it isn't cheap!"
16036,4975,5," Where do I start with this& well lets start at the very beginning& its a very good place to start.This was a Christmas present for my 8 year old playmobil mad son&and got it for a fantastic price as well&arrived very well packed and on time after an initial let down from a company called Ace Of Deals who trade on Ebay&who never sent the ship&there is so much to this ship and I have to say there's a fair bit of building with it&one thing to note straight away&when you open the box you will see a large piece of polystyrene-DO NOT discard this as it is part of the ship and is not packing&it did take a while to build(however we did build it on Christmas day& so with everything else that was going on&we were back and forth to it) and some patience is required as it does have a few fiddly bits&there are lots of accessories with this&that any seafaring pirate could possibly need&from a treasure chest to firing cannons&as with all Playmobil its well constructed and thought out&and will give a child many&many hours of imaginative play&i bought some extra pirates to go with this and the pirate rowing boat with shark&my son has not stopped playing with it and the boat has been into many adventures and battles&including being raided by the Playmobil police and hijacked by 2 Playmobil clowns&a word of caution with this& whilst it does float perfectly in the bath(hence the reason for the polystyrene I mentioned earlier)you will need to remove the paper sails from the masts as they will be ruined otherwise& the sails do come off quite easily and did not lessen the enjoyment my son had with it in the bath&once the boat has dried out& the sails go back on easily enough&the boat also has small wheels underneath it&so runs nicely across the carpet& or any other firm surface&once again Playmobil has come up trumps with another quality product-To sum up&Happy Dad&Happy Pirates and a Happy Son-This is one boat that gets my vote."
16037,4975,5," Meant to buy the smaller pirate ship& but the lad loves it so what the hey.Combined with his cowboys and soldiers it is making my niece's life that little more interesting (she has to clear up after him)."
16038,4975,5," What can I say!  This was the 'big' present at Christmas 2014 for my 5 year old and he was amazed.  Really big box helps.  We haven't put the sales on yet (nearly 7 months on!) and he plays with it a lot.  Everything in there that you'd need for some great pirate fun& and we're sailing it around the bed room a lot.  There's a little pirate pack you can get with a small sail boat and some treasure for about Â£10 - worth getting that at some point too as our pirates use the little boat to row to shore a lot!It was a close call between this one and the smaller one with the remote control (really sails) but we've only ever played with it in the bedroom/lounge so I think this one was the best option - size over sails.I would rate this as one of the best Playmobil products available.  Very interactive& although does take up quite a bit of bedroom space!"
16039,4975,5," Amazing! Playmobil always are and this is no different. The detail is brilliant with all the weaponry and the cabin below deck& the sails and rigging& cannons and the covers my boy loves to open and close& not to mention firing cannons (sorry dad). I could go on. My almost 5 year old has played with it a huge amount already and he was only given it 2 days ago! Be warned it is big& approximately 2 feet long& but it's so great we'll probably be saying goodbye to some of our more babyish pirate ships - making room for more of the playmobil pirate range."
16040,4975,5," The pirate ship was our boy's birthday present when he turned 4. He loves pretendning to be a pirate and this was the ultimate present. As his birthday was early January we also got the Playmobil pirate advent calendar in November and started introducing the world of playmobil pirates to him each day of December. The ship is easy to build (with the help of dad& obviously)& and good and sturdy. It's been bashed around a few times and still goes strong. Well done playmobil for giving my little ones so many hours of fun"
16041,4976,5," My nephew loved this gift. Although there are a few fiddly bits& the shark and being able to play in the bath with the toys made it a winner."
16042,4976,5," This is an excellent toy purchased for a friends child age 4.  He just loves bathtime and this good quality item is great"
16043,4976,5," I bought this as a present for my little boys 5th birthday and he absolutely loves it! We bought it to go with the Playmobil Pirate Ship and Pirate Gang and he absolutely loves it! There are so many other accessories included with the row boat& such as pirates and firing cannons which my little boy has spent hours and hours playing with. He loves the fact that this item can be taken in the bath and even includes a shark! An excellent quality item which is very strong and doesn't seem like it could be easily broken."
16044,4976,5," My grandson (aged 5) loves this set and especially the shark. He has played with it almost constantly since receiving it."
16045,4976,4," Bought as a Christmas present for my five year old grandson& along with another version of a Playmobile pirate ghost ship& we had great fun firing the cannons at each others boats (along with my 68 year old brother in law).  As with all Playmobile toys& you can see the quality of the product& and the enjoyment both children and adults get in playing together with them."
16046,4976,4," Playmobil toys are always a great gift for kids& it was a present for my nephew as he likes pirates etc. The toy is very nice and the boat quite big compared to the playmobil ones I used to have at his age ! The problem was that the box came nearly wasted so I had to wrap the toy and give it. The game itself is what you expect from playmobil."
16047,4976,5," My 4 year old grandson loves this whole item for play either in or out of the bath - I am frequently met by firing cannons& swords& and pistols! Just watch the small bits don't go down the plughole!"
16048,4976,5," This toy is good value for money. Goes well with the other pirate toys and the Fort with Dungeon which we also bought. Together& they give my 5 year old grandson lots of fun."
16049,4977,5," More robust than others we looked at. Good size and looks brilliant in my little 5 year olds room. Would certainly recommend this product. It was easy to build and very solid."
16050,4978,5," Lots of love from my 3 year old godson. He loves it and takes it everywhere!!!Best thing I have brought"
16051,4978,3," Great for a cake but had to wash it really well before using it as it was very grubby!"
16052,4978,5," Looked great on top of cake and now used as toy after birthday"
16053,4978,5," came within 2 days. perfect for top of cake. thanks!"
16054,4978,5," Quite small but matches Izzy figurine"
16055,4979,5," Bought my Grandson the pirate ship and these pirates.He absolutely loves them.Plays for hours.He is 3years old and I was worried he might be a bit young but he isnt."
16056,4979,5," Bought these pirates with the wooden boat by the same makers for my 5 year old son. thought 50 all in was a bit exspensive but when you get it and see how much fun they have with it i'd say it's easily worth double. spent a fortune on my son as you do but i would say this would have to be the best present he's ever had.there is lots to do so the kids don't get bored easily"
16057,4979,5," This is a fantastic first pirate set by Papo.  Well made and great details.  Worth the money even though expensive.  Will be played with for years after other cheaper figures have broken."
16058,4979,5," Great addition to our son's Barbarossa pirate ship present"
16059,4980,5," Blue box ! I love it....looks like my old pirate ship of 1980 bought by PLAYBOUTIK.com last year...floating very well. My children very happy with it. See U"
16060,4980,4," Spanking good fun for a four-year-old boy.Some of the many pieces are a fraction small & so they get lost a bit easily& but this is only a minor gripe.Hours of role-play and imaginative fun for him and his 6-year-old sister."
16061,4980,5," I bought this for my 4 year old grandson and he loves it.  You have to assemble the pieces before it can be played with& so if it's for a young child might want to put it together before the offering is made."
16062,4980,5," This looks amazing& but as it was bought for a Christmas present& it is yet to be opened."
16063,4980,4," I purchased this for my nephew who's 4.  He absolutely loves it."
16064,4980,4," A little hiccup with delivery (down to the driver going to the wrong house I think) but otherwise a speedy delivery and intact.I'm sure my boys will love this and the Skull Bones Pirate Ship (different seller) for Christmas.  They're a little pirate mad at the moment and playmobil is always tough so it will hopefully provide hours of fun for the boys and rest time for mummy"
16065,4981,4," I ended up with two of these by mistake (my mistake) and it didnt arrive when I had hoped. However having ended up with 2 I wrapped them for Christmas and added them to my 2 daughters christmas stockings they are 5"
16066,4981,5," A very nice item& the person who I got it for really liked it! Well worth the money and probably have hours of fun with it!"
16067,4981,4," Lovely little torch for toddlers. Perfect size for our two year old to hold he loves the noise and he loves shining the light on the wall. Suprisingly robust too. It survived eating two soldiers which then got stuck! pulled them out and he is still working fine phew!"
16068,4981,5," Bought for one-year-old to go with other Jake toys& and this went down a complete hit at Christmas! The torch has a skull/crossbones which projects on surfaces that are quite close. When you press the botton to open his mouth& he makes the tick-tock sounds. Then when you release button to close his mouth& he makes a chomping/biting sounds. It sends my wee one in stitches! Excellent value& not the greatest torch in the world& but brilliant learning"
16069,4981,4," Was a big hit with a 4 year old boy. He still plays with it a year on. Have had a few incidents with him putting other small toys in the mouth (the crocodile eating them!) and them becoming jammed. Thought the toy was broken a few times& but we managed to fix."
16070,4981,2," Very disappointed with this toy.From the photo I expected a much larger toy but when I received it I was shocked how small it actually was.My own fault for not checking the measurements I suppose but for Â£15 I found the item a total rip off!"
16071,4981,4," I purchased this for my 5 year old daughter who is a huge fan of Peter Pan/Jake and the neverland pirates.She loves it& has been carrying it everywhere with her. Seems durable enough for little people.Would recommend."
16072,4981,5," this is my grandsons favourite from jake and the neverland pirates& he loves it and takes it to bed with him& all you see is the torch shining and the pic transfered on the wall& would recommend"
16073,4982,4," We bought this as a stocking filler for our 5 years old. Despite the title& there are instructions in English too.Like other games by Haba& the game is presented in a nice tin& and contains a dice& a special pencil to mark |scars| on the players faces& some coins and eye patches. All the components have a high quality feel.The game can be played in two ways. The dice has two similar symbols such as a cannon. One shows the cannon being fired& and the other just the canon. In the basic game these differences can be ignored.The slowest player to make the action based on the dice roll& receives a |scar|. When the coin symbol is rolled& the capitain uses their coin to choose one of the side. The other players reveal their coins& and if they have a different symbol  they receive a scar. This is good as this doesn't rely on being quick. First to five scars loses.Good fun for the kids& and a game lasts about 10 minutes& so doesn't take too long."
16074,4983,4," nice mat. excellent mouse traction. the only bad thing about it that ive seen is after a few months it has very& very slightly warped."
16075,4983,4," As described and fast delivery"
16076,4984,5," Really nice little toy set.  Bought as a cake decoration but also good for the birthday boy to keep and play with.  Great price at Â£4.99 as usually Â£7.99 in toy shops."
16077,4984,3," This was ok& it wasn't expensive so didn't expect much& it's very small. Bought it to accompany the Jake skull castle. For the money it's fine."
16078,4984,5," Expensive but much loved. Warning thoughâ€¦ if your child is playing with these in the bath the paint on the characters does mark the bath if scraped along the side."
16079,4984,5," Three and a half year old loves playing with these figures together with Hooks pirate ship.  Even took to Peter Pan Panto."
16080,4984,4," Great. We bought our 3 year old Hook's Jolly Roger pirate ship and this went perfectly."
16081,4984,5," Arrived on time and in good condition. And was really well priced. Overall really happy"
16082,4985,5," Arrrived on time .well packaged .bought for my 3 year old son .he loves this toy its taken dogs abuse but is still sailing.bit pricy but what isnt these days."
16083,4985,5," Good quality and they love the fact you can fire water (plastic) out of the cannon - goes well with rest of the set and a welcome new addition"
16084,4985,5," My 2-year old loves this product. Is very sturdy and canon gets a workout. Cute trapdoor and plank - which he loves to use. Perfect for kids who are just getting into pirates."
16085,4985,5," This is a brilliant toy for  my son he loves it so much and has lots of fun with it and his older sister like it too& would recommend to anyone"
16086,4985,5," Bought this for my 2 1/2 year old grandson for Christmas and he loves it. We bought Jake and the Neverland Pirates Deluxe Adventure figure pack to go with it so that he had some more figures to play with. He likes the 'cannon balls' that fire.'"
16087,4985,5," Goes with quite a big set.  Brought for my 3Â½ year old boy.  He loves the collection.  Durable and hard wearing.  We Try not to loose the blue cannons& as they are thin and fire well into the lounge. Brought to go with an pirate adventure pack"
16088,4985,4," swift delivery.  Bought as gift so not opened box.  looks solidly made for small hands. Comes with one figure as stated."
16089,4985,5," I bought while reduced to Â£9 must say it was a bargain buy but defo not worth the rrp of Â£24.99It's a great toy my little boy likes it a lot"
16090,4986,5," I love (as do my children!) all Papo figures&you really do get what you pay for here&so do spend those extra few pennies because these figures will last your children forever&their own grandchildren will be playing with them in years to come&they don't break&they withstand a little teething if the baby gets hold of them and with a little imagination will fuel your child's play tin for hours and hours.... My son now 18 has just given all his papo knights to his younger cousin&they are still as new starting their second round of adventures!"
16091,4986,4," My grandson loved these figures& he has several and this was a stocking filler at Xmas.  He loves pirate related toys& so this fitted the bill perfectly.  A good unusual figure for his collection."
16092,4986,5," What every little boy wants& a reallyScary character& I get them for my grandson Freddie& he is into knights and pirates& at the moment."
16093,4986,5," Great detail. Arrived in great condition and is quite robust."
16094,4987,4," love love love playmobil! I would say though that there were LOADS of little bits so have kept a few hidden in the box until my kids are a little bit older but can see why people lose bits so much! fab little set though& the fact that the canon actually fires went down a storm!"
16095,4987,4," Play mobile has delivered another great toy. Great addition to existing play mobile products- enables Noah's arc to become a pirate attack ship with cannon (the favorite component) to do battle with a pirate rowboat etc."
16096,4987,5," I purchesed this for my sons birthday along with a few other items from the Pirate set. he adores it as does his little brother. The quality is very good and has held up to two boys playing with it."
16097,4987,5," lots of playmobil in a small box and it made an excellent small gift for a big brother on little brother's birthday ..a good addition to their collection of playmobil"
16098,4987,5," I bought this item to go with the Playmobile pirate ship for my little boys 5th birthday. I was impressed by how many things were included in this set& there are so many accessories that come with the pirates and my little boy has spent hours and hours using them all. The instructions are simple to follow and it is very easy to put together& it also seems very sturdy would be difficult to break any of it. An excellent quality item!"
16099,4987,5," Have bought this as an Xmas pressie and am certain that my grandson will love it! He already has some Playmobil pirates so these will be a great addition. They arrived very quickly and were well packaged. Would certainly use this supplier again."
16100,4987,5," Bought on Thurs as a Xmas present. Arrived Saturday morning. Very happy with fast delivery plus it was free! Packed great and happy with value for money :) Will be ordering more for birthday in Feb. Thank you."
16101,4987,5," A great present to go with the complete set.  Lots of fascinating bits that keep the kids quiet.  Comes highly recommended and guaranteed to get big smiles.  As always well made and worth the price."
16102,4988,4," This is a great set if your child is into pirates. It comes with a firing cannon& a glow in the dark skeleton and two pirates with their own accessories.This would be a great starter pack for a child new to Playmobil. I bought it as an addition to a pirate ship and other pirate sets for my son's 4th birthday and he loves it.The only slight downside that I would say is that in comparison to the other 'sets' you are paying for the carry-case so you do get less accessories.As with all 4+ Playmobil range it is fine for a careful 4 year old& but it might not be appropriate for a more boistrous child as it's a bit fiddly and some pieces can get easily lost (like the cannon balls- they have quite a range when fired!)A good set."
16103,4988,5," Playmobile is extremely well made and durable. The dungeon is very good as it can be carried around with figures inside. My grandson thinks this is the best bit but it also encourages him to use his imagination& not necessarily in the way the toy was intended. It is not intended as a bath toy but pirates like water!!!"
16104,4988,4," Nice toy and very sturdy. I dont think that it is big enough to play with on its own as the description suggests but make a great accessory for a child with other pirate toys."
16105,4988,5," Present. Child who loves pirates. Playmobil is fantastic and this is a great take along play thing. Goes well with any other playmobil pirate stuff."
16106,4989,5," Very happy! My aunty bought my son this for his birthday and he hasn't stopped playing with it since. He's not even a big scooby doo fan& just loves all the wee features!"
16107,4989,5," very pleased with this& bought this in addition to go with scooby doo haunted mansion and my son loved adding this and the pirate scooby doo characters to his collection"
16108,4989,5," My grandson has had hours of fun with the fort and playset."
16109,4990,5," 100% quality"
16110,4991,5," It is an Awsome figure from my favourite Star Wars film Episode I The Phantom Menace. The bubble of the package was badly damaged but the figure is in a freshly new condition. The price was great for a figure released in 1999 and is definitely worth buying. It makes a great addition to my other Star Wars characters and am proud to have bought it."
16111,4991,4," good"
16112,4992,5," Great product"
16113,4992,5," excellent"
16114,4993,5," Fab& funny& and an excellent edition to my growing minion army"
16115,4993,5," Very cute and such fast delivery - thank you"
16116,4993,5," My son loves this. Good quality"
16117,4993,5," Love it and it's really a good size too"
16118,4993,5," Good and quick delivery!"
16119,4993,4," Just a decorative item& but made a good topping for granddaughters birthday cake."
16120,4993,5," Minty fresh"
16121,4993,5," great item"
16122,4994,5," Excellent quality from Hasbro as usual. Very easy to pose. Arrived on time."
16123,4994,4," Grandson loved it! I thought it a little pricey."
16124,4995,5," Great"
16125,4996,5," I Just got this for Christmas and it was amazing!!! It has a awesome hour glass& with golden sand in the middle!!! The detail on this is exceptional. It has beautiful imprinted stars and the hour glass turns around when you spin the knob. I would deffinitly recommend this toy. I would recommend anything that is a product of Noble Collection!!!!!"
16126,4996,2," I do realize that this should be a collector's item& but in my opinion it is totally not worth the money. First of all it is made from a cheap antimony (stibium metal) that has been electro-chemically plated with only one micro-layer of gold (wich isn't durable nor very valuable) which isn't a surprise as it is made in China as the label on the bottom of the display case states. It does not spin& and any attempt at spinning it would result in it falling to pieces on the floor& the tiny hourglass had a little shape flaw. Overall it feels delicate but it's very pretty at first sight and with a little care could be carried around but it does not satisfy the feel and the imagination& it rather looks like a |muggle reproduction| if i may say so.P.S. such a product shouldn't have been more than 5 pounds& 8 with the display case."
16127,4996,5," Looked good but didn't actually work. Needed to go back in time to catch a train but wasn't able to despite turning the hourglass correctly. Bit disappointed."
16128,4996,5," I bought this time-turner at the Harry Potter warner bros studio tour (the exact same one) and Was scared to wear it after reading the reviews but started wearing it a week ago and am unable to take it off! It isn't as fragile as some people make out as long as your careful with it it's absolutely fine! I love it and would happily buy more of the Noble collections products :)"
16129,4996,5," Absolutely beautiful. I bought this as a present for my Mother and contrary to some reviews I can confirm that it is an Original and official NOble Collection item. I have the exact same one that I bought back from the official Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Orlando and they are exact down to the boxes and mini certificates that come with this product.There was a slight issue with the first one I received"
16130,4996,5," bought it for daughters birthday& although she loved it .i thought it looked rather cheap as it was expensive &oh well how can you put a price on the joy of your daughters face"
16131,4996,5," This is a great gift..if i was to say just 1 slight let down was the presentation box is plastic. I feel it may have been better if it was wood. But still a great great gift"
16132,4996,5," A very delicate& and beautiful necklace& exactly the same with the one Hermione is wearing on the movie. There's an engraved motto on it (didn't know it and was really amazed when I first saw it). It comes with a guarantee from the WB.It definitely worth its money!! :)"
16133,4997,5," Grandson will love this good item for a competitive price"
16134,4997,5," As described. I'm sure our grandson will love him."
16135,4997,3," A lot of plastic but grandson seems to like it!"
16136,4997,4," Greeted with enthusiasm by 6 year old grandson"
16137,4997,5," Excellent - my little boy loves it"
16138,4998,5," Good quality& detailed statue."
16139,4998,4," No complaints. Would buy again."
16140,4998,5," Just awesome!"
16141,4999,5," Ceci est un super achat& trÃ¨s dÃ©taillÃ©& de trÃ¨s bonne qualitÃ©& j'en suis trÃ¨s content& aucun souci. MERCI ! A+++"
16142,4999,5," I bought the figure here because in my country was out of stock. A little expensive i think for the boom of the movie.Whatever a nice buy."
16143,4999,3," I bought this action figure for my nephew who likes comics a lot. He liked it very much but he is not going to take it out of the box. He's going to keep it as a collector's item."
16144,5000,5," Super product brought for my super hero mad son he loves it"
16145,5000,5," Looks great - Good size figurines and bright colours. Looks like a quality product and fantastic value considering you actually get 3 characters you get for the price of one. I'm sure my 5 year old is going to love them."
16146,5000,4," My nephew loved this set! Batman and Superman's capes are made of cloth& which looks great& but I wonder if it'll withstand the abuse of a 5 year old.The figures are nicely designed."
16147,5000,4," Great set of chunky figures. Excellent value. Lex Luthor's weapon has this tether/ammo belt on it which is weird to attach& but the rest of it is just fine."
16148,5000,5," This is to be given as a Christmas present but I was very pleased with it and I know my Grandson will love it.  I think the price is good also."
16149,5000,5," Quick delivery. Great figures and good size. Our 3"
16150,5000,5," My nephew loves these toys and has spent hours playing with them."
16151,5000,5," This was a really good bargain my little man loved them xx"
16152,5001,5," This product is fab for any twilight fans! Even as an adult I love them! Girls will have so much fun with Bella and Edward dolls!"
16153,5002,5," excellent !"
16154,5003,4," I'm not a Gundam expert but I've been assembling a couple of HG models and thought of challenging myself with RG. The product arrived earlier than I expected& I anticipated it to arrive after Christmas since I ordered them a couple of weeks before. The instructions are easily understood (I just followed based on the label and the diagram). The product was indeed challenging& but not hard to assemble. It has inner frame (unlike the HG models I own) which allows to make more poses& that is cool. It is my first time with RG so I experienced a lot of parts popped out when trying to assemble all them together. It was not as smooth as my experience with HG models and it take more time. Maybe because I'm a first timer. But they give a lot of spare parts and stickers which I like (in case I lose it). And I notice the model is more detailed in terms of its features and more colors. I would definitely get another RG models from this seller next time. Overall& I am happy with it."
16155,5003,5," Only just started building it but it's so freaking detailed it just blows my mind how anyone could come up with the pieces that put it all together. An incredible bit of engineering on the part of Bandai and so so so worth the price. Any fan of Gundam should be picking these up."
16156,5003,5," Not really a big fan of Gundam& but saw this and thought it was perfect for my desk toy collection!It's very detailed. I was originally going to paint it up& but when i saw the level of detail putting it together& i figured that the paint wasn't really needed for the amount of detail i had in mind& the model itself does that very well. The decals are also stickers& no water needed which i found was really handy& I remember using decals when i was young and they could be a real pain to apply.One thing though& careful when you're cutting the inner skeleton parts off the sprue. Some are connected via actual connecting points used to attach the pieces together and I accidentally cut off a bit. Fixed it with some glue though.Would highly recommend even to a non Gundam fan."
16157,5003,5," Great to build with lots of detail and gimmicks crammed into its small size. I would recommend previous modeling experience due to the small parts and complexity."
16158,5003,5," Bought this as my first Gundam model because it looked really cool and was very glad I did.Not too difficult to assemble and it was fun to do and a little therapeutic.Impressive how all the parts are so intricate and how they well designed everything is.The range of motion in finished model is good.Instructions were not in English which wasn't a major problem as you can figure most things out from the diagrams.I did find an English translation online which it is worth googling to find for some key instructions."
16159,5003,5," Despite this being the first gunpla model I've built& I felt that the construction was largely enjoyable (with easy to follow instructions) and that the levels of detail and articulation in the kit are first class. Although the model has some weight distribution issues with the wings it can be stood up by positioning the feet slightly further apart.  In summary& a great kit with amazing amounts of detail and panel lining opportunities and the few small problems are easily solved with very little effort."
16160,5003,5," Arrived in good packaging with a little note thanking me for my purchase which I thought was nice since it was written in Engrish. All the parts were there and even thought the instructions were in Japanese I had minimal problems putting everything together. Some stickers were a bit tricky to put on but overall I'm very pleased with my purchase. Putting this model together was a great way of disconnecting from technology and by the time I was done I felt less stressed out than I've been in a long time."
16161,5003,5," Absolutely brilliant!!! RG are a pain to make but it's worth it."
16162,5004,5," Prompt delivery and the dragons are gorgeous. Present for a friends bday and they loved these :) would def recommend for GoT fans"
16163,5004,5," Lovely display items"
16164,5005,5," This was the first S.H. Figuarts figurine I've purchased and the first of Sailor Scouts I've received so far.The paint job on Mercury is excellent& no colour bleed or odd colour changes. She's very posable& the legs for example can bend until she can essentially sit on legs like a normal human. The amount of faces you get are great and you get two version of her bangs for the computer screen and without and two versions of her computer (open and closed).Well worth the money."
16165,5005,5," Delivery was very quick and I am really pleased with this product. She is my fourth figure from the Sailor Moon S.H Figuarts collection and well worth the money."
16166,5005,5," Arrived in good time and great condition& im really pleased with this product and i look forward to completing the collection"
16167,5006,5," Very good pack well and on time ok thank"
16168,5006,5," Delivered on time and kid loves it."

16172,5008,5," Bought for grandson who loves Iron man was delivered in great condition. I personally think these figures are over priced for what they are . My grandson loved it but some on the price is far too high for such a small item ."
16173,5008,1," Chinese piece of sh1tarms came off and i dont know where i need to put them back on and that suit case had a human finger inside"
16174,5008,5," I bought this because i made a hall of armor and it looks GREAT! I Dont use the accessories but the figure is great"
16175,5008,5," Great toy but not very robust. Broke after a few weeks"
16176,5009,5," Hasbro continue their series of figures from the animated movie The Clone Wars with #10 Clone Commander Cody. Like the previous issues& this figure has a more stylised `animated' appearance than the standard figures and as such certain body proportions and structures can look a little odd.Based on the framework for the previous #04 Commander Rex& this figure has all the poseability of that release and identical equipment.Cody has head (rotational and vertical)& shoulder (rotational and abductional)& elbow (rotational and vertical)& wrist (rotational and abductional in the left hand)& waist (rotational and vertical)& hip (vertical)& knee (rotational and vertical) and ankle (rotational and vertical) articulation which gives him a massive 25 ranges of movement.He comes equipped with his helmet& a gunmetal DC-15A with gunmetal grappling launcher that clips onto the barrel& a gunmetal DC-15B& a gunmetal missile and a gunmetal grappling missile. The missiles fire by appliyng downward pressure to the back when they are in the gun.An excellent figure and a must have for those Clone Armies."
16177,5010,5," it looks so much better when you have it in your hand then just a photo it go's really nicely with my Kotobukiya Poison ivy i love it so much"
16178,5011,5," Awsome zyudenshi"
16179,5012,5," This is just another Star wars model to add to my gransons collection he thinks its fantasticMay the force be with him"
16180,5013,4," The toy was bought for my son...he loves all things ben 10 and plays with all of them constantly..so far the toy has lasted well..no detachable parts is a much better idea."
16181,5013,5," Perfectly happy with this toy. Another character for a 6-year-old's vast collection of Ben 10 aliens. Played with a lot. Not bought for |educational value| as such but used in imaginative games."
16182,5013,5," According to my nephew Ben 10 models are the best thing ever! If only he could afford them with his pocket money!"
16183,5013,5," My little boy is a huge fan so we brought a few figures for christmas and he has played with them non stop since"
16184,5013,5," Thanks"
16185,5014,4," Very limited articulation but excellent detail and good size. Plastic feels excellent definite must buy for under twenty pounds"
16186,5015,4," My son loves the combat carl figure as rarely seen to purchase however the bonus dvd does not work on uk dvd players and not stated in listing details.  But figures are great xx"
16187,5016,5," The new gi joe 25th anniversary figures are excellent and very articulate.I have many already and plan to get more."
16188,5017,5," Great condition& great product"
16189,5018,5," Awsome"
16190,5019,5," I have him! He is fantastic totally worth the money. :) here he is dressed for Halloween."
16191,5019,5," Brilliant I want the others now !!"
16192,5020,3," You get just One figure out of a possible six& and it's random which one you get. I got an alien. It comes with one-size-fits-all instructions for assembly& so I haven't been able to finish making it. I'll get a child to help me! It's not suitable for the children I work with& as there are too many small parts. Not good value."
16193,5020,5," I love Playmobil figures and have a little collection of Romans and gladiators which I use to teach history. I enjoy the surprise of these |blind| bags and the fun of putting them together - any figures that aren't related to history get sent to my godchildren."
16194,5020,5," Brilliant for amusing my son - he loves the surprise of which he'll get"
16195,5020,5," awsome item thanks"
16196,5020,5," Pleased"
16197,5021,5," very happy to receive& thank you."
16198,5021,3," As with the TARDIS and K-9 Set this was overpriced (at time of writing& since then it may have changed) and worse& its Tom Baker starring you in the face with his bad acting& and the disappointing excuse for a Dalek creator Davros.  The characters and the price are both poor.  Unless& unlike me& you are a fan of the TBakers then this will probably not appeal& the worst in the set and only worth getting as the full set or to complete the set"
16199,5022,5," Arrived super early and it looks awesome i love it so much!!"
16200,5022,5," She is so cute! And definently an authentic figure! And fast delivery too! Was really happy with my purchase. Also the paint job was amazingly done. :)"
16201,5022,5," She truly is a beautiful figure& great quality. The real deal and delivered in great time! Happy overall!"
16202,5023,3," It's what my daughter wanted and I'm sure she will love it& but personally I find it expensive for what it is. The Light Up Princess Celestia does the same thing but is less expensive. Trouble is 6 yr olds don't think like that."
16203,5023,5," This was bought as a Christmas present for my granddaughter so have not actually opened it yet.  It arrived well before the estimated delivery date.  I know she will be delighted with it."
16204,5024,5," this is an absolutely fantastic transformer it is so easy to transform any child would be able to do so if you've got children who love transformers and may find it difficult to transform them then this is the one for them this is one step transform and there is many other transformers in this one step range my son loves it he can transform it on his own no need to ask us for help"
16205,5024,5," Very easy and simple to transform for a 5 year old."
16206,5024,2," Slightly dissapointed in the size of this toy and for the price I paid too didn't think it was worth it. Will be good as a stocking filler."
16207,5024,5," Of the 3 Transformers that my 4 year old got in his stocking from Father Christmas this is his favourite one. It transforms really easily and looks great in either mode& our 2 year old can do it too. Whilst not wanting my son to learn of such things just yet& the best way to describe the transforming action is to say it's like a flick knife.The arms are moveable and poseable. One gripe is the arms do get pulled off but it's all robust enough that they clip back on easily enough. And me being fussy I wish the chest plate sat better in robot mode as the spring lifts it up a bit& but my 4 year old doesn't care.Loving have Transformers to play with again although these just don't seem as well built as the ones I use to play with 30 years ago. But they are a lot easier to transform.Anyone know why one of the rear lights is metal and not plastic."
16208,5024,5," Bought this as a stocking filler for my 3 year old. Showed him once how to do it and he can do it no bother. Feels a little flimsy but he plays with it every day and takes it to bed and it's still going strong! Slightly concerned he'll take someone's eye out when in robot mode but so far so good!"
16209,5024,5," My 3 year old loves this. I can actually work it too& we've had transformers before and I can't even 'transform' them we have to wait for daddy to come home! This is very straightforward and went down very well as a stocking filler."
16210,5024,5," Brilliant. My son is 3 and a bit and loves this. It's not fiddly and he worked out how to transform it in minutes. Great toy."
16211,5024,5," good sized& robust toy& pretty easy to transform by a young child themselves and functions well as a car."
16212,5025,5," Perfect in bath toy for older girls"
16213,5026,5," Good product. Great service! Thanks."
16214,5027,5," The Smiler as it appeared in The Beast Below& Series 5. Here's my opinion.Smiler: The Smiler has some articulation& but not all of it is good& but I don't worry about articulation at all& not really. The detailing has been done brilliantly& and is similar to the appearance on the TV show. It's a great figure and I would highly recommend it to everyone& children and collectors alike. 10/10"
16215,5028,5," This Daryl Dixon figuirine is amazing! It seems bigger than expected& even though the size was listed. The attention to detail is fantastic.Daryl comes with a detachable hunting knife& crossbow with bolts and a poncho. You have to detach the head to put in the poncho which is difficult& but worth it. It is also quite fiddly to attach his crossbow but once in place it looks brilliant.I would definitely recommend this to Walking Dead/ Norman Reedus fans!"
16216,5028,5," High quality figure& looks very much like Daryl even down to his ear sticking out the hair ... the attention to detail is amazing..very high quality item with in my opinion little money a total bargain .. hope they bring different ones with this detail as I havent seen anymore like this.  You don"
16217,5028,5," I bought this for my sister's birthday& she has a crush on Norman Reedus and we all love the show. It was the perfect birthday present!It's very finely detailed and very well made in general& I'm really pleased with it and so is my sister.The hands seem really fiddly though and we didn't want to break them getting his crossbow into his hands& so we left it on his back. He still looks great as an ornament."
16218,5028,4," Look exactly like the actor Norman Reedus.Lovely packaging also and just the right size.My only criticism would be that the crossbow doesn't fit into his right hand so you have to balance the crossbow on his holding left hand which is a bit poor.also nowhere to stick the extra arrows you get in the package so dunno why they included them.The knife however fits perfectly into his knife holder"
16219,5028,5," If you love The Walking Dead series and like to own some TV/movie memorabilia or figurines& this really is one to get. It isn't even that expensive after you see the size of it. Although it says on the description its 10| in size& I still was amazed by it.The Daryl figurine comes with his trademark crossbow& a knife to put in a leg holster and the poncho the guy wore in season 3(?).The figurine is really great in detail in my opinion and the only negative side being in the whole package is the slight challenge in putting on the poncho for the figurine& as it is by default a separate object.It says on the package that the head must be removed to do this but if you gently jiggle the poncho on him it will go without the need to remove the head. The crossbow also is a bit difficult at first to put in his hands at first but some careful bending of the figurine's fingers will eventually make it possible to put it properly in its hands. All these two mentioned things needs is a bit of patience."
16220,5028,4," Nice quality action figure. Like others have said& its a little tricky putting the poncho on& and definitely has getting it to balance and stay standing up issues.Not very happy about the face detail. On the box is a photorealistic likeness to the actor& but the actual figures face is plasticy& with a few black brush strokes for detail& and mine definitely has wall eye. Four stars because the face definitely is not photorealistic like the box or internet sites would have you believe&Just thought I would give an update on this item. I brought the Rick grimes 10| deluxe figure& and if the two are stood next to each other& the proportions are way off. Daryl is slightly crouched over& whereas rick is standing up straight&  but their scale look completely off when stood together. If you are wanting to collect the 10| deluxe figures& they just don't look right stood next to each other because of the sale differences although they are both supposed to be 10| scale. Both figures have wall eye!"
16221,5028,3," Figure is ok with pretty good detail. Unfortunately it doesn't come with a base and it keeps falling over. Most of the time his head falls off when this happens. It wouldn't be asking much if it came with a little base& especially at that price. Item arrived quickly though and was well packaged. Many thanks to the seller for that!"
16222,5028,5," Once again detailing is first class from McFarlane! Superb example as is the Rick Grimes one! 10/10"
16223,5029,4," I bought this set for my 9 year old& he loves it and has since added to the set. I was concerned it would not fit him but it has adjustable fittings so is plenty big enough. Well worth it!!"
16224,5030,5," The first of my collection of Star Wars figures.  Good quality figure and two nice accessories - two guns for Princess Leia.  The children enjoy playing with the figure and it stands well."
16225,5031,5," my grandson loved it"
16226,5032,5," I've waited since Christmas for Peso to be in stock - and bought it at Â£4.99 to go with little one's Gup A and Gup D.  He had Gup A for Christmas and Gup D for his birthday in March.  We waited months for Peso& Shellington and Tweak to be in stock anywhere - wish I had bought all 3 at the same time as they are now out of stock elsewhere and gone up to Â£12.99 here!  Am not paying Â£12.99 so unfortunately we will have to wait even longer to complete the set.  It's a treat now and then& or for good behaviour& to get a new Octonauts character - but Â£4.99 is the absolute most they are worth!"
16227,5032,4," Great quality and a necessity for the set - be warned though all the octonaut figures have marked our bath due to over zealous play! (and the marks do not come off!)"
16228,5032,5," We have the whole set of Octonauts figures& and I have to say& they are probably one of the best sets of toys I've ever bought& they are probably the ONLY thing that both my kids can play together without them fighting or getting bored! My daughter is 18 months and son is 6& so it's been hard to find something they both like& and as a result& I've ended up buying the entire Octonauts bath range! The figures are durable and safe for my toddler& whilst providing enough play value for my 6 year old son& as he enjoys the accessoires& role play and colour-changing features! And my little girl always wants her big brother's toys& so these are ideal for them to play together. Some of the prices have gone sky-high as a result of christmas& but I managed to get most of mine for Â£5 a pack for the figures from supermarkets& they really aren't worth paying silly money for& the most i will pay is Â£10 for figure sets& and that was for inkling& tweak and dashi just before xmas& really can't understand why Peso is so much money as we got him for Â£4.99 from John Lewis& beware of being ripped off!"
16229,5032,5," My five year old is obsessed by the octonauts and I quite enjoy watching them too.  They are funny at times and educational.  All in all a really good view for your child.  On every morning at 7.50 on cbeebies.  This item has added to his collection as he reinacts scenes from the episodes . . Brilliant and worth every penny."
16230,5032,2," toy was ordered for grandchild.  she liked it because she adores octonauts.  However the jellyfish did not turn colors as details stated.  Keeping it since she opened and put in water but did not fulfil  description of dots turning colors!"
16231,5032,5," My Daughter was very& very happy when she unwrapped Paso on the morning of her Birthday& he seemed to be sold out of every shop we had been to for months before her Birthday& so one very happy little Birthday GirlðŸ˜ƒ!Great value for money& although this can often be purchased (if in stock!) from most Supermarkets for a slightly cheaper price& this is just me being very& very picky though and I cannot fault the service received within a couple if days of ordering!"
16232,5032,5," Grandchildren just love anything to do with Octonauts and play with these figures and the other Octonauts toys for hours.  Amazing something so small and simple can bring so much joy to them - and peace and quiet for parents/grandparents too! Also& onsidering how much they play with them& they seem very resistant to damage/breakage which is worth mentioning as so many toys break too easily and too soon after purchase. Well done whoever came up with the idea."
16233,5032,5," Why give them 4 stars you may well ask? As and adult I reckon they are dear for what they are but the Grandson we bought them for thinks they are great. So as a grandparent....JOB DONE!"
16234,5033,5," Here we have the Sideshow Luke Skywalker Jedi Knight 12| figure& this depicts Luke as he is seen in Star Wars Episode 6& Return Of The Jedi. A slightly smaller and thinner body than most is used& as is the case with all the Sideshow Luke figures& this is done to take into account Mark Hamill's smaller stature.On the plus side& the overall look of this figure is pleasing with good and accurate attention to detail in the face& clothing and accessories.On the down side& the body of the figures seems to thin for that of Luke Skywalker& the fit of the jumpsuit& although well made& seems to loose around the groin and waist thus not giving the tight clean fit like that of the character.The clothing elements that the figure comes with are a removable sleeveless hook neck cloak& a removable cloth waist coat that is secured around the waist with a seperate velcro secured cloth belt. These parts can be used to depict Luke at the begining the movie during the Jabba's palace and Sarlac fight scene's. To display the figure during the Lightsaber duel scene's with Darth Vader& a removable black utility belt can be fitted onto the jumpsuit instead of the waist coat and belt assembly. The lapel / chest flap of the jumpsuit can be displayed open or closed.Accessories supplied are a ignighted Lightsaber& an exstinguished Lightsaber hilt& a large leg bone as used by Luke as a weapon as seen in the Rancor pit battle scene& a saber grip black gloved mechanical hand& a saber grip flesh coloured mechanical hand with blaster damage& a saber grip left hand and force wield left hand.The figure has what you would expect from a sideshow 12|& a great quality& articulation and likness to the original character. Well worth it for any Star Wars fan to add to their collection."
16235,5034,5," It is a bit out of character for Tsumugi to wear a bunny costume& but it is really lovely and detailed."
16236,5035,4," Decent playmobil toy& but little overpriced in my opinion.  Windscreen and back bits always coming off but thats playmobil for you!  -  Would have more fun with other playmobil stuff for not much more money& but in fairness it does what it says on the tin"
16237,5035,3," My son has more Playmobil than you can shake a stick at& but became obsessed this year with the new Spy series (we now have everything in this series!).  Unfortunately the quality of the plastic clips in this and some of the other toys in this series is not up to the same standard as previous Playmobil toys we have had.  This has both the rear wings facture where they hinge on the back of the car and the response from Playmobil is that we can buy replacement wings& we only bought this in July for his birthday and they were broken by August from not especially heavy play. The Robo Gang Satellite is even worse by the way.  The toy itself is still loved and played with by my son& this is one of the few he actually bought himself!  But I am very dissapointed with the quality of this product and series in general compared to the other Playmobil toys we have."
16238,5035,5," This was gratefully received on my sons 5th birthday. We have lots of Playmobil toys both new and passed on and they never fail to meet expectations. They are virtually indestructible and are so cleverly made with interchangeable parts. I cannot recommend this highly enough."
16239,5035,2," Though my Son insists on keeping the item& I am quite disappointed with the quality of this"
16240,5035,5," I am very pleased with the quality of this toy. Manufactured to a high standard and purpose. Hours of childhood fun and sturdy enough to become a keepsake for a lad who can destroy the toughest of toys in minutes. An excellent buy"
16241,5035,5," Bought this for my nephew and it was a huge hit. He's currently really into pretending to be a spy so this was perfect. Playmobil always good quality with attention to detail that makes everyone smile!"
16242,5035,5," Because it needs to be assembled my grandson (6yrs) felt a real sense of achievement when he managed to assemble it and since then has had many hours of fun playing with it."
16243,5035,5," ordered for our eldest Grandson who was 8 at the time he enjoys it and its good quality as playmobil normaly is .Very easy to put together no problems at all Thanks Amazon"
16244,5036,5," My grandson collects these figures - good value for money"
16245,5036,5," My son loves this toy& enough said"
16246,5036,4," As described"
16247,5036,5," Excellent"
16248,5037,5," I was extremely pleased with the items I bought.  I was extremely pleased with the items I bought.  I was extremely pleased with the items I bought.I was extremely pleased with the items I bought.  I was extremely pleased with the items I bought.  I was extremely pleased with the items I bought.I was extremely pleased with the items I bought."

16250,5038,4," It's Star Wars Episode IV-VI dogfighting on your tabletop& and you get to play with X-Wings and TIE Fighters. What more do you need to know?The rules are simple& gameplay is fairly fast& and the components are beautiful. And it's basically 'playing with Star Wars toys' but with a rule system. However& the core set only gives you three ships and you'll soon want to expand your squads. This is where it gets expensive. In fact& many people are investing in two core sets and at least one of each expansion.And with Wave 2 around the corner& offering A-Wings and TIE Interceptors& along with big ships like the Falcon and Slave I& it's more than likely you'll be looking at an outlay of ~Â£100 for a set you'll be happy with. Fantasy Flight Games know what they're doing with this one."
16251,5038,5," If I have one question for Fantasy Flight beyond |would you like me to change my payroll account to your number?| it is |why didn't you do this sooner?| XWM marries a tried and tested gaming formula (Ã  la Warhammer or Wings of Glory) with arguably the biggest film franchise of all time. It's a match made in Heaven& or& at the very least& the nearest 3'x3' flat space you can find to play. In summary& X-Wing Miniatures is excellent& but be warned: it's an atrocious money sink. Read on to find out more...This is the core set& although 'Core' is in very grave danger of being a misnomer. 'Bare essentials' would have been more appropriate. Included in the box is& admittedly& enough to get a small scale& 2 player game of Miniatures going. On the Rebel side& one T65 X-Wing& and on the Imperial side& two TIE/LN starfighters. You read that right: Fantasy Flight have wisely considered their audience and sidestepped the New Trilogy. I also like that& with the in-universe assertion that Rebel pilots often fought their opposites two- or three-to-one& the ratio of 2:1 is faithfully maintained in this game. The models are absolutely gorgeous& and I breathed a sigh of relief to know that I wouldn't be hand painting them& although I've seen plenty of examples already where gamers have decided to go all Warhammer on their fleets regardless. These sit atop plastic bases into which pilot tokens are inserted to create the final playing pieces. My main concern is that the models& especially the X-Wing with its little cannons& are INCREDIBLY delicate. This is not a tabletop game for the clumsy or heavy handed.Read more â€º"
16252,5038,5," Â£25 sounds like a great price for a new game& but you'll definitely end up spending a lot more after it arrives.The mechanics are good& the miniatures are great& the other components are well made too.. this is a really well designed game as you'd expect from Fantasy Flight. The rules are pretty simple (watch the FF youtube explanation) yet deep enough to allow lots of strategy with other ships. The gameplay is fast and fun and really captures the feeling of a dogfight in space.I do have some minor complaints though - and even though they won't damage the score of this review& they are worth taking into consideration. Firstly the price (and need) for expansions make this potentially very expensive. I bought the Millennium Falcon and Slave I too& but personally I don't enjoy using them as much because I prefer the small-ship battles - not everyone will agree with me here& but I'd just be careful of throwing cash at them. The game itself can also get a little bit fiddly as you have to use lots of range markers and accurately move your ships whilst filling the table with markers of all sorts. You'll need a big table to get the best out of the game (the recommended board is 3'x3'.. but that doesn't include space for all of your ship cards and extra bits). It also doesn't come with any kind of 'board' or mat& so beware that playing it on your brown table might detract from the theme somewhat - and extra space mats that work for the game are another Â£25ish.Finally the packaging is pretty annoying as there are no inserts for any of the multiple components in the box.Read more â€º"
16253,5038,4," The game arrived on Thursday and we played our first game on the Friday& the set-up for this game is strait forward and simple. 2 x tie fighters and an X-wing are included in the game complete with everything needed (apart from a flat surface to play it does include everything!)Each model comes with its own stand and multiple pilot stats. You can have anybody from Luke Skywalker to an academy pilot.The models themselves are extremely good quality& painted to a good standard and if the other craft in the range are equally as good I don't think you will be disappointed. & The scale seems to be about 1:144 so I would suggest you are not going to see a star destroyer! Although the Millenium Falcon and Slave1 are in the pipeline along with an A-wing and the Tie strike fighter on top of the already released Y-wing and Advanced Tie fighter (Darth Vaders ship)Movement and turning sticks& weapon range stick and all the markers are made of a good quality heavy-duty card (I personally would have preferred a plastic but I think with normal use you have got years of use with the supplied templates!)The rules work on a igo-ugo system of pilot quality& the lowest quality pilot moves first then up in proceeding levels of experience until the the top dog moves.Firing is in reverse with the best firing first and working down (at this moment in time its worth mentioning if you are in a perfect shooting position and you get hit and destroyed& all that hard work will go up in a puff of smoke!)In the evening we had some eight games using 2-3 Tie fighters an a single X-wing& we varied the quality of pilots and weapon and equipment loads for the craft (the x-wing can vary its weapons and equipment - the Tie can only vary the pilots!Read more â€º"
16254,5039,5," The kit is nicely boxed with clear instructions& it is already black so there's no need to paint it& unless you really want to.It would be nice to see more kits of the smaller spacecraft from the Star Trek films."
16255,5040,5," Although Blades is just a repaint of Alpha Bravo with a new head& I think Blades pull's it off better as a whole."
16256,5040,4," This was another Xmas gift. The recipient was delighted to receive it."
16257,5040,5," This was a Christmas present for my grandson and he loved it."
16258,5040,4," Great"
16259,5040,5," Good"
16260,5041,5,""
16261,5042,4," Silly me& my boy wanted a red bakugan& so I ordered this& and when it arrived it was green. However& it seems to be providing much enjoyment nevertheless& and is not broken yet after several weeks of rough play. No education value at all& but thats what school is for is it not?!"
16262,5042,5," This was bought for a friend of my 6yr old son for his birthday& he'd never had a bakugan before but knew rather alot about them and my boys totally love them so decided to buy it for him. Apparently he loves it! It arrived in time for the party undamaged. Many thanks."
16263,5042,5," Obviously enjoyed and understood by grandsons I was just a rank outsider. Looks cheap but appeared to with stand the battles."
16264,5042,5," My son loved this and was so excited to receive the package so quicklyWe will come back again sometimeThank you"
16265,5042,1," for babies only!"
16266,5043,4," A worthwhile addition to my collection."
16267,5044,5," a fun smurf too add to a smurf collection&if your a collector then you must have this one lol&i got a couple of schleich smurfs a few months back&since then what started as a bit of fun has turned into a collection&i now have 14 and counting...great fun items!"
16268,5044,5," Amongst others I bought this for my Grandson who is mad about collecting smurfs.  It was lovely to see him open each box and find smurfs he didn't have.  This one was one of MY favourites."
16269,5044,5," Another different Smurf for collection. Would give this to someone who was retiring& to go on top of a cake. Seller was prompt in delivery and no problems."
16270,5044,5," Great maker& a well detailed Smurf lots of interest. Much appreciated by thecollector who received it ! Very therepeutic to look at."
16271,5045,5," Got a legit figure from Toy Zany. All is good although it should be noted the pictures for the item are a little misleading as you only get the lab-coat body."
16272,5046,5," Bought this for my 4 year old grandson and it is brilliant. Very strong and durable. To get Buzz to run really well it needs to be on a flat smooth surface& but once he starts moving he can travel a fare way."
16273,5047,4," Looks incredible.The way the captured Sanjis look is like that pulled him right out of the anime and put him into a figure. The modelling and paint work is truly brilliant and looks just how Sanji looks like he should be.BUT..The articulation with the figure is terrible.. If you're only looking to just stand him normally then you should get this figure. His legs can barely move so that makes posing for kicks impossible. This figure is extremely fragile so take the upmost care when dealing with this.Final score 7/10"
16274,5047,5," Good figure well packaged arrived promptly purchased as a gift for my daughter who loves it."
16275,5048,5," bought as a pressy"
16276,5049,5," Bit small but fun all the same looks bigger in ad. Cant grumble good price my son loves I and that makes me happy& he hasn't managed to break it unlike other toys."
16277,5049,5," Ordering was so simple&delivery was on time and my son loved it!successful choice all round.will continue to use this site!!"
16278,5049,5," Excellent figure of wreck it Ralph. My little boy has lots of fun with it!"
16279,5049,5," Just as described !"
16280,5050,5," It's huge! Much larger than the average pop figure& detail is great aswell. I got it for my boyfriends birthday as he loves gaming and pop figures and he is over the moon with it :)"
16281,5051,5," Perfect book for my 3year old grandson. I know he will love it. So much in it and all appropriate and manageable for a 3year old.Really good website& service and delivery from seller. Would definitely use again."
16282,5051,5," Bought for my grandson and iut was a big hit. Fast delivery too& Definitely recommend."
16283,5051,5," Good quality product. Bought for my 4 year old grandson& we completed most of the activities together and he enjoyed them& but a child up to age 8 or 9 would probably be able to do them on their own& and there are many activities and colourings suitable for the older age group."
16284,5051,5," bought this book for my 4 year old grandson.  He loved it.  We spent a whole afternoon doing colouring and using the stickers.  The book was better than I expected.  Nice colour pictures and a lot of different activities that we were able to do together."
16285,5051,4," Son loves the stickers that much they are currently on every porous surface in the house. As I type Raphael is stuck to my slipper sock. Awesome dude!Great seller &  prompt delivery and good price.Will use again&  thank you"
16286,5051,5," My 3 year old literally jumped up and down when we gave him this. Some bits are too advance for him but if getting it just for sticking it's great. Lots of little stickers and some big ones too."
16287,5051,5," One happy little boy who is a big ninja turtle fan who has a excellent collection of turtle items not a bad price.Delivery was excellent would buy again from seller."
16288,5051,5," Purchased with crayons for party gift. Looked good. Good price heard the birthday boy was kept very entertained by it! So recommend"
16289,5052,4," The toy has amazing detail such as the face and the flower on the shirt. Squeeze the legs and the jokers removable hammer (with face on either side)will shoot out  an attack. The one downfall is that his legs dont bend and his other hand doesnt bend either. Overall I would say this toy is good value for moeny."
16290,5052,5," Son loved this he now has most of the power attack batman bits. This was better value then on the high street."
16291,5053,3," They certainly dropped the ball on the quality of the model with this expansion.  The paint job is quite poor and although it features folding wings& when properly deployed the hull badly separates on one side.  This cannot be fixed without breaking the ship apart and carefully trimming the support strut on the hinge.  Any attempt to repaint the shuttle is not advised unless you are prepared to glue the wings in the open position as the closing action will scrape some of the paint off the wings where it recedes into the hull.  The head of the shuttle is also modeled with no curve across the width of the cockpit& but unless you know this ship very well you probably won't notice.  The cards with the expansion allow the shuttle to be kitted out with a variety of different tactics like the Weapons Engineers which allows you to maintain 2 target locks& or the Anti-Pursuit Lasers which allow you to potentially deal damage to a ship which overlaps your base."
16292,5053,4," Like many I had been put off by the Shuttle because of the problem with the wings. Eventually I cracked because I just had to have one. I'm glad I waited& because it appears FFG have listened to the feedback and fixed the issue. On my model& the wings fold up and down as smooth as you like. Very pleased overall. It's not the greatest combat ship obviously& but it adds an interesting dimension to the game."
16293,5053,5," You know& this is possibly one of the most unfairly lambasted ships in the game& but for the life of me I'm not sure why. For it's points& it's a really nice ship. Good offense& solid amount of shields and hull. Only downside really is the lack of evade dice - but then& that's why you have so many shields and hull points.Also& not sure if I got lucky& or if they've tweaked the mould for the ship& but the wings on my one sit where they should when opened."
16294,5053,5," big model with nice detail& great cards (pilot and upgrade) good for your collection"
16295,5053,4," While it's not a combat ship by a long stretch it can be a useful support ship.Model is nice& wings fold up and down as you would expect them to& you my model however and probably others& when you fold down the wing it kinda catches a little but you just have to pull it slightly away from the body then it kinda clicks into place."
16296,5053,5," Perfectly adequate in all respects."
16297,5053,5," Brilliant service and rapid delivery.The Shuttle is very well made and robust with a range of excellent upgrades that broaden the scope of the game"
16298,5054,5," Great well made but with kidrobot thats what you get& i can not fault it. Great paint job."
16299,5055,4," this figure is fun to recreate battles from spiderman 3. it has 4 different hands to fit onto him and he is poseable. however i think his arms are too long. but apart from that i would recommend it for the spiderman fans"
16300,5055,5," This is a super realistic villain for all young spidy fans. changeable hands are great they just pop on and off with ease. fantastic buy!!!"
16301,5056,5," ok I have tryed pulling off the pices but they wouldnt budge! Its good to play with thats saying something!"
16302,5056,5," IT HAS LOTS OF DETAILS. BEAUTIFUL SHAPE AND COLOUR WITH MANY CLEVER ARTICULATIONS. YOU JUST HAVE TO ADD IT IN YOUR COLLECTION."
16303,5056,2," this is a strongly made toy but was a disappointment to my 5 yr old grandson because it did so little."
16304,5056,4," Grandson delighted with this toy"
16305,5057,5," Her details are very well done and it looks really good for its price. Also the extra parts are fun to customise her with& the stand works really well at keeping her upright and you can pose her in quite a lot of positions. It's a little stiff the first time you try to move a joint but after that it's completely fine. It did a good job of capturing Trish& if you like her I really recommend this."
16306,5058,5," Great item. My son loves role playing with his Ben 10 toys. Hes always making up new stories and acting out the ones he sees from the television series. Great for any child who loves Ben 10."
16307,5058,4," Ben 10 is a favourite in our house and this is a great addition to the Alien collection!"
16308,5059,5," great item.  Hand is a bit heavy for the model& but not a problem. The arms are not very stretchy& but just bend a little."
16309,5059,5," This is an excellent action figure and if you are a fan of the show it is an ideal collectors item. It looks exactly like Jake should do and has some bendy arms& which don't really do much& but hey& it's Jake! The kids love it. I seem to think it looks good with the 10| Finn action figure which is available also."
16310,5059,4," Though this toy has not been played with much (my 6 year old is currently obsessed with 'Neca' Marvel and Streetfighter figures) this is a very well made toy and a great present for a child who enjoys the cartoon."
16311,5059,5," This figure is a great valued toy& it is well made& keeps clean and retains its original sharpness.It looks just like the character should be."
16312,5059,5," Quick dispatch& excellent item& my 6 yr old boy loved it& so happy to of found as I have been searching for Finn"
16313,5059,5," Jake the Dog& great figure as described& any Adventure Time fan will love it.  Well packaged& fast delivery& would recommend."
16314,5060,4," My son loved it but at his first attempt at putting it together one of the crucial pieces in the neck broke so I've superglued it and we're keeping our fingers crossed otherwise it's going to be headless!"
16315,5060,5," Good quality toy. Son loves it& lovely colour and well made. Very happy would definitely recommend. Now wants more in the series."
16316,5060,5," When your child is super hero mad& this is a great product that has to with stand some serious punishment against the baddies!!"
16317,5060,5," Babby loves it& always playing with it& has some really good fights against other super heroes& a few quid well spent. JB"
16318,5060,5," Arrived on time and is as product description. Grandson loves it."
16319,5060,1," Not good item parts come apart easy and easy lost"
16320,5061,5," Bought this for about Â£9.Excellent bargainStickers are easy to put on&just do it before you start building the van.Easy to build and very solid.Not sure what other people are doing that makes it fall apart&maybe not putting it together correctly.Fits all the turtles and more.The rocket launcher is good&can see the springs going after about a year of play.Bigger than I thought but that's a good thing.Buy it&especially if you can get it cheap like me."
16321,5061,3," Don't pay full priceWe purchased this at half price and I'm glad I didn't pay more it is very flimsy and parts keep falling off always putting doors back on etcOur 3yr old had this for his birthday and it was a massive hit. we did purchase the 4 figures separately so overall a Â£60plus present. I think for the price you pay for the van you should at least get 1 figure with it"
16322,5061,3," My son loves turtles. This van is a lot more colourful than the one he already has plus it shoots missiles which he loves. The only downside is the missile housing and the front of the van which flips down keep coming off. They are easy to put back on as they just clip on but when you have to fix it every 5 mins it gets really boring."
16323,5061,2," My son loves this but I have to say it is cheaply made. Isn't worth the money as roof& doors and small parts keep falling off. Stickers aren't put on properly so are coming off after 2 weeks. Luckily didn't payFull price."
16324,5061,5," granson will be over the moon with this."
16325,5061,3," What a lot of money for a toy that is really poorly made. Especially when it's for a boy that likes to act out his favourite cartoon. The parts don't even fit well together."
16326,5061,3," The top where missile goes easily comes off& I think it's quite expensive for what it is no sounds or a figure which I think should include 1"
16327,5061,5," Great price great item!!"
16328,5062,5," my son loves this and the sounds are great"
16329,5063,5," My 3 year old loves this"
16330,5064,4," This has been one of my 4 year old son's favourite Xmas presents. I advise opening it and putting in batteries before wrapping! There are a few flimsy bits to it but hasn't broken yet. We have already lost one of the missiles& and the flimsy grabber hand attachment seems pointless to me. However& my son loves how it changes& it's easy for him to use and has exciting sounds and lights so is great in the dark too. A great buy!"
16331,5064,5," I have heard on several occasions how amazing this was as a present. My 4 year old nephew loved this& and it was even more of a bonus finding it at such a great price. I'm afraid I can't comment on the quality& but it certainly scores well on value for money given the amount it has been played with."
16332,5064,5," My son absolutely loves this.  It transforms very easily which is usually a nightmare with the figures as he is only 5.  It makes noises& has lights&lots of little things to move inside& everything children love."
16333,5064,4," Got this for my little boy and he likes it....lots of things that make noise/lift up flaps/guns twist round and lights....he is now 6yrs old so he says he recommends to any other boys !!! :)"
16334,5064,4," This item was well packaged and arrived in good time for Christmas present last year. THe toy was good quality and my 9 year old nephew was very pleased with the toy and plays with it a lot."
16335,5064,5," My two grandsons ages 6 and 7 were delighted with this&it has everything little boys enjoy&noises&flashing lights etc.I thought it was a good price&not too expensive.Highly recommended."
16336,5065,4," Product arrived well packaged and in good condition.  Looks sturdy and my son will love it for his birthday party. Was a little smaller than I anticipated but it is as described and of good quality."
16337,5065,5," As described. My son loved it"
16338,5066,5," I was extremely happy with this service as the parcel arrived really quickly and my grandson was very impressed with the surprise Moshi character that came as a surprise with it."
16339,5066,3," This was fineIt was what it sayed it  was although the moshlings were ones she already hadWould have been better if we  had known which we were getting"
16340,5066,5," There is a little boy who is delighted with this initial collection& great they come in collectable and affordable packages."
16341,5067,5," This is an awesome model for any transformers collector& don't be fooled by pricing however& these can be bought& new& under 150 UKPounds from a large number of specialist toystores websites& the 200+ and 400+ pricing is just an amazon stores gouging the gullible tax"
16342,5067,5," This is worthy of the title 'Masterpiece'. Plastic is nice and sturdy& definitely not cheap-feeling. Very poseable and accurate to the original 1980's model and& in my opinion& looks even better.A must-buy for ANY Transformers fan. Especially& if you're an Optimus Prime fan like me."
16343,5067,5," Perfect& exactly as described. Couldn't be happier with this product."
16344,5068,4," My children first played this with two Germany children&they were all under the age of six. With the help of a Mum as translator they all found the game enjoyable.They learnt to count in each others languages and enjoyed being able to move the mice around at the risk of being caught by the cat and losing their acquired cheese.There was also the fun of climbing the ladder and sliding down the chute in the cheese .They must have enjoyed it as they've asked for one for Christmas."
16345,5068,5," This is a truly BEAUTIFUL game to enjoy for children!As always from Ravensburger"
16346,5069,5," Bought this for my friend& never seen the anime before and she was absolutely delighted with it! See a lot of feedback on here saying the item isn't as pictured? The one I got was exactly as pictured. Same colour& same strap& same design. Only thing that was different is the box... And you don't wear the box!"
16347,5069,2," Watch is not as pictured& its a distressed gold/bronze colour where the picture shows a dark silver and is actually a pendant and not a pocket watch on a chain. Disappointing. I would advise the seller to update the description. Also clearly not an officially licensed product as it came in a white gift box."
16348,5069,4," I was over the moon with this pocket watch. I think you get really good value for a fiver. It works and comes with a spare battery. It's quite small but very elegant. It's an antique silver colour. I love that it's got the Phantomhive crest on it. Definitely recommend to all Sebastian Michaelis lovers."
16349,5069,2," I got this on request of someone else and when it arrived I was mildly confused. It came in a pink box with a pink ribbon and when I opened the box it was a goldish colour not the colour depicted in the images. Clearly this is not what i thought it would be."
16350,5069,4," The item itself was great and the box really pretty but when i opened up the package it smelt like egg - so horrible - luckily the watch didnt stay smelly but thought id mention it"
16351,5069,1," Disappointing. Did not come as pictured but is still a quatz watch with correct engravings. It's a nice showcase item but not true to the picture at all."
16352,5069,1," You do not receive the watch pictured. If is poor quality and not the same colour of style as the one pictured! Very disappointed!"
16353,5069,3," The box it came in was different& it was a white with the Kuroshitsuji but also had a sticker on it with |Shingeki no Kyojin|? Not sure why& just quite random. The colour of the watch is slightly different from the photo shown as well& it hasn't got that sort of rusty look to it but it is the same image and the watch works prefectly fine so I can't complain much. Its a nice little pocket& just looks a little different then what they're showing."
16354,5070,4," Slightly smaller than expected. My son is 3years old and find the legs and arms come off easily. You can get slightly bigger more solid ones from b and m for same price."
16355,5070,3," the sword pouch at his back pops out and it's very hard to put that rubber piece back in"
16356,5070,5," amazing i love the mix n match version"
16357,5071,5," Daughter loves it"
16358,5072,4," Ordered this for my daughters birthday. Came very quickly and packaged well. Great for Hunger Games enthusiasts but I feel quite expencive for a toy doll& but then Im not such a fan as my daughter."
16359,5072,5," great little action figure& got it as a christmas present and the person i got it for will be very happy with it:)"
16360,5072,5," A real surprise to find this model. The attention to detail is very good.Pleased with the model. Thank you."
16361,5072,5," Quick delivery - would use again :)"
16362,5073,5," Much better than first batch& card mint."
16363,5074,4," I received a Tom Baker 181cm cardboard cutout for Christmas& although I can't for the very life of me think why. I like Doctor Who& in moderation. And I'm sure Mr Baker is an extremely nice man with lots and lots of endearing personal qualities. But& by God& is it unsettling to have to share a house with him.First of all& he was sent directly to me and so I got to marvel for myself at the sturdy packaging which had transported him through time& space and Postman Pat's van. A rigid cardboard foldout affair& concealing the Fourth Doctor himself. These cutouts are a fantastic idea& but who exactly decides  who gets to be immortalised in this manner? It's a fairly motley crew that's available to buy& all things considered. Still& I was immediately (and rather naively) impressed by the quality and indeed clarity of Tom Baker's image. All I had to do was a bit of cardboard origami at the back of him and& hey presto& the Time Lord himself was stood before me.I don't quite know how long I myself stood there& staring at him. It's those eyes. It must have been a good few minutes though. Well& I couldn't be having that on a regular basis. So I decided to bung him in the front window for the benefit of passers-by. Mind you& I did fall significantly foul of that when coming home from a party just after Christmas. You know how it is& you over-imbibe on the Babycham and then before you know it& from a position lying tired and emotional just east abeam the garden path& you start to believe that the Tom Baker 181cm lifesize cardboard cutout in your window is a burglar of some description. I don't know how long I spent outside that night either& just staring at him.I tried moving him into the downstairs loo after that& somewhere a bit more out of the way.Read more â€º"
16364,5074,5," Fabulous!!"
16365,5075,5," This has been a fantastic buy. My 8 year old son spent hours playing with it on his birthday and it seems to be the only present he plays with! Would definitely recommend."
16366,5075,5," Happy son hangs his TMNT figurines off the shellraiser& it drives around on remote control whole the figurines  talk to each other. Thank you Flair& nice prompt delivery"
16367,5075,5," Arrived quickly and my 6 year old son loves this! Great remote control vehicle and fires the discs a good distance."
16368,5075,5," I bought this as a gift and my granddaughter loves it!  Remote control is a lot of fun. Worth every penny."
16369,5075,5," Very good item and great price"
16370,5076,5," Like the other action figures from neca that one did not dissapoint. Only one complain& whyno other weapons? I could use sniper rifle or snub. But figure itself is perfect :D"
16371,5077,5," Exactly as described and delivered on time&thanks"
16372,5077,5," Fantastic figure for all fans of the Lannisters"
16373,5077,5," Great detail brilliant figure"
16374,5078,4," Need I say more. the only problem I have is that the dalek bits fall of and can get lost ( vacuumed up)"
16375,5078,5," My sons have had no end of pleasure from these. The doctor has lost his hand though."
16376,5079,5," Awesome& a must have for any tmnt fans& Better than expected!!  Fantastic seller too& would definitely buy from them again!"
16377,5080,5," Granddaughter loved it. It fits her sets of farm beasties ! Fast service and good quality & fair cost"
16378,5080,5," My son loves it"
16379,5080,5," Kids luv it"
16380,5081,5," Didnt buy it on amazon but a diffrent online store this figure is the best hot toys pain job i have ever seenSome people complained head is small let me explain why i hot toys did that first of all if they made a bigger head than the mask wouldnt fit guys u gotta let that go hot toys is doing what we want having a mask on mask off feature is great something neca dont doValue for money it depends on how much u want spend these figures go for 185-199 this figure is old a value may only increase as years go on id say grab it nowPaint work flawless 10/10Cant rate delivery did not buy on amazonOveral figure worth getting to your collection"
16381,5081,3," The predator came with broken straps on his armour& which kept falling off as a result. One of his legs is so stiff I can't try to move it without fear of damaging him. Everything else is fine. The predator was brand new& so I am a little surprised at the condition of the armour& and am looking into fixing the various issues. I would have given 5 stars if these problems weren't present& because everything else is perfect."
16382,5082,5," Very happy with item"
16383,5082,5," Excellent thankyou"
16384,5082,5," Amazing more than expected. Really cool figure perfect condition have recommended this sight to many people. looks great in his man room."
16385,5083,4," When it arrived& it came in great condition& but having said that two of the arrows broke when I tried to get the figure to use his bow& since they're very delicate& and Legolas can't hold the arrow to the string with accurate precision as shown in the picture for this product& although the slits in the arrows do fit on the string& so at least you can fire them& which is more fun. There aren't any actual instructions on how to fasten the quiver to his cloak& which is removeable& but after some fiddling& during which time he gets lots of attention and fussing over& it is worth the effort& and he looks great once he has his arrows inside it at his back& bow in hand& with simply beautiful patterning and detail on his clothes. His face and hair look incredibly realistic& and his hands feel very real too& in a funny sort of way& and he holds his bow in perfect position. The daggers are so pretty when you take them out of their scabbards& and the gold detailing on them& and on the quiver is stunning. There's a switch button that you can slide down to hear him say several phrases& such as& '|You have my bow|'& '|There's a fell voice on the air|' and '|Something draws near& I can feel it|'& and his voice resembles the actor so well& and sounds as if the character's actually in your room& which is so cool! You can see the switch through a big enough hole in his cloak& and the elven brooch on the collar can be unfastened if you want to take the cloak off. Aside from the mishaps with the arrows& which you basically need to treat with care& he is a fun enough collector's item and toy that stands an amazing 20 inches high& and possesses a brilliantly shifty look in his eyes to emphasize his precise eyesight& whose head is easily poseable& as well as his arms and hands. His legs are not as poseable& but he still stakes his territory in my room and is on the lookout for any invaders."
16386,5084,5," this is a very great toy for ages 5 and over and it is like the easiest thing ever.first& pull the front window up and you see the autobot's head.next& hold the window in place and split the part that comes up.You could just do the second step if you are a bit lazy!VERY GREAT TOY RECOMMEND FULLY."
16387,5085,5," very good in quality& and my friend said that  he likes it very much. ( so cute is this Miku)"
16388,5086,5," This toy is brilliant.  My granddaughter is 13 soon and wants to go to Alton Towers for her birthday.  As i usually make the birthday cake i thought i would do a theme park as a topping and this is one of the items for it.  It will also be a good keepsake for her.  Brilliant toy& well packaged and would recommend this seller."
16389,5086,4," A nice little toy.it is an ornament type toy though not really suitable for younger kids as I can imagine it might be ruined.nice to look at and spins round when handles turned."
16390,5086,3," Smaller than I had expected but quite sweet."
16391,5087,4," This is the 2nd last pop I needed to complete my Arrow collection (still need 1 more)..this pop is a lot cooler than I thought it would be. The paint work is neat and there's no flaws at all. There was a mix up with the shipping so he was a bit late and arrived in good nick .. slight dent in the front bottom corner but other than that looks great."
16392,5087,1," It was broken when it got here. Package was fine& but he was missing his arrow. And his hand. It was a surprise for my boyfriend to finish his collection and its broken."
16393,5087,5," Absolutely perfect! Item arrived in perfect condition and much earlier than expected. Thank you."
16394,5088,5," My 12-yr-old son loves Minecraft (of course!) and absolutely LOVES these mini figures! Buyers beware though - they are tiny! I knew how small they were prior to purchasing them so it was not a surprise. If you're expecting large (or even medium) action figure size you will be very disappointed. However& size aside and as long as kids are old enough not to try and eat these& they are very cute and my son loves playing with them. His friends like playing with them when they're here as well."
16395,5088,2," So small hard to play with"
16396,5088,4," These are tiny figures. Really tiny. Bought 50% off in an Amazon deal and for a keen fan at that price I'd recommend them. I would have looked at them at full price and figured money was best spent elsewhere. Great stocking filler idea."
16397,5088,3," These are tiny& about the size of a 1p coin - on the up side& they are well made and my kids love them.At Â£5 for the 3 its not too bad."
16398,5088,4," Good little models. Also look super amazing on top of a birthday cake& but you have to remove them because they are a bit chewy."
16399,5088,5," My son loved these and are on display in his room yet he also plays with them."
16400,5088,4," My daugter was made up with these not as small as i thought they would be."
16401,5088,5," Good value& something my son had put on his Christmas list."
16402,5089,5," You can't beat Tomy when it comes to Pokemon figures both for play or display. Super cute and very durable!"
16403,5090,5," Well worth it would defiantly recommend it will be getting some more of these there nice to give to someone. As a gift or for your self"
16404,5090,5," Comes out with the classic Walter remarks. Very funny indeed. Good for all Jeff Dunham fans. Goes well with Peanut and Achmed."
16405,5090,5," Excellent Xmas present& its like the character 'Walter' is in the room with you. The 10 phrases are very funny and epitomise the characters grumpiness."
16406,5090,5," Better quality than expected. Great voice. A must for Jeff Dunham fans"
16407,5090,5," happy with it"
16408,5091,5," Not very well advertised at all& Mattel restarted its Masters of the Universe property back in 2008 with the new& larger& super-articulated Masters of the Universe Classics line& almost every single product of which is (or was) only available online& usually for limited periods of time only.  Designed for nostalgic grown-ups with disposable income and not for children& it's a series of very good to excellent toys (admittedly with the occasional quality control issue)& trying to incorporate everything that has ever been associated with He-Man.  They've tried to include items from the original vintage Masters of the Universe toys& to the 1980s Filmation He-Man and She-Ra cartoons& to the 1990s sci-fi-themed revival& to the |Millennial| toys and cartoons of 2002-2004& to unproduced concept figures that were planned but never made.  It's the most comprehensive and wide-reaching reincarnation of the property to date.  And now Mattel has gone and made the long-desired centrepiece of the line: Castle Grayskull.Based on the original prototype and beautifully sculpted by The Four Horsemen workshop& this version of the castle has features not seen on the Vintage or Millennial versions of this playset.Read more â€º"
16409,5091,5," O)K"
16410,5092,4," With the love of Tamamo& i can ignore all those paint mistake and strange face comment.There is just too few tamamo figure in the market"
16411,5093,5," Bought all 4 figures for my collection. Marty's Mum figure (lorraine) is missing& why?"
16412,5093,5," Smaller than expected but great likeness"
16413,5094,4," Bought this as a present for someone who is mad on transformers but had lots of them. The child was delighted with this present."
16414,5095,3," My daughter bought me one of these and I was dissapointed to find that the grille was a dull gold coloured plastic. I contacted Diamond Select who informed me that they no longer make the metal grille version so beware. I sorted this out by painting mine with Humbrol paint& looks great. Apart from that& the communicator is very good and plays the part well. It goes well with my Wand Company phaser. The 55 year old kid is happy."
16415,5095,5," Excellent comunicator prop you get the chirp when you flip the cover and the whole thing looks right taking it with me on my next away mission."
16416,5096,4," Not a fan of these new wave Transformers& my 5 year old son really struggles with them& but this level 3 Dinobot is an exception. Quite sturdy& and once you've worked out how to transform it& it is pretty easy -and no fiddly little tabs to have to click together unlike some others we have"
16417,5096,4," I bought this Transformer for my young son& it's based on the latest animated series and while he hadn't seen any of those he has loved this toy& it's a good solid construction with no little fiddley bits to come off during transformation.It looks great as a dinosaur and pretty good as a robot... and has lead to much running around the room and roaring from my son...It's not that difficult to transform& though some bits might need some adult help depending on the child...The only real criticism I have is that the lava club does not really stay in his hand it quickly falls out which can lead to some young frustration... that has however now been |lost| so out of sight out of mind.All in all though a good chunky transformer& that my son has really enjoyed."
16418,5096,4," Bought this for a 6-year-old's birthday. He is obsessed with Transformers and dinosaurs& so what could be more perfect than a Dinobot?! Very happy with the quality of the toy and seems pretty sturdy."
16419,5096,4," Bought for 3 year old and although its aimed for 5 year olds& the 3 year old& with help thoroughly enjoys playing with it. Can not transform independently. A good buy."
16420,5096,5," Its a good toy& it comes wiv a lava club and (suprise& surprise) you can transform it into a man|robot."
16421,5097,5," What can i sayLooks awesome! Kept in box so as to collect/display so cannot comment as to toy/entertainment features but if you love the flash (and come on who doesn't) then its a must buyIt goes perfect opposite my Flash action figure and right next to my Arrow pop vinyl :-)"
16422,5097,5," Awesome pop goes great with Reverse Flash"
16423,5097,5," I love these little guys. Mine arrived in a perfect conditioned box and the item inside the actual figure was perfect too. Paint job was well done and unlike what some people have reported no problems at all. Really collectable little ones& this and the Arrow were my first 2 and I have to say can't wait or christmas to get some more."
16424,5097,5," Very pleased cant wait for son to see it very fast delivery"
16425,5097,5," Looks so great on my shelf& thank you for a quick postage!"
16426,5097,5," I bought this for my Father who is a big fan of the TV show. The styling is great and really captures the character. A quality purchase."
16427,5097,4," Fantastic little guy to 'pop' on your mantle piece. It arrived in a 'Flash'. Perfect for those fans out there!"
16428,5097,5," Amazing product. It arrived very quickly and I would highly recommend the seller me product."
16429,5098,5," Amazing figure :) Highly recommend"
16430,5099,5," He was delivered quickly and came in good quality. His packaging was undamaged and the quality of the figure is great. He's my first Figma figure and he's easy to pose& put on his stand and add his different accessories. I really love the figure and he was a great price so I will be looking for more figmas and as a huge Kaito fan I am so happy! It was great to see he could be posed above his Figma base using the arm too& first Figm and very& VERY happy. Would definitely recommend this for any Vocaloid or Kaito fan :)"
16431,5099,5," Soo Cute And Fun To Have In Your Room& If You Collect Figma Or Nendoroid Then I Suggest This!One Thing Is To Be Careful As His Microphone Is Very Fragile& *Mine Snapped Off :(* But You Will Have Fun!"
16432,5100,5," great"
16433,5101,5," Got this for part of my son's xmas to add to his collection:)He loved it!"
16434,5102,4," Card board Santa& 6 ft standing easy assemble& exactly like picture& gives the room bit more Xmas spirit& recommended."
16435,5103,5," Rather cannily& FFG give us a reason to shell out for individual X-Wings and TIE Fighters rather than just buying more Core Sets: the separate expansion boxes include unique pilots and cards not found anywhere else.Worth your attention in this expansion more than any other is Wedge Antilles. Indeed& he's worth the price of admission all by himself and I have yet to see anybody field an X-Wing without him at the controls. He has the double whammy of being highly skilled (9) whilst also reducing a defender's agility (and therefore rolled defense dice) by one. All of a sudden the X-Wings and TIE Fighters become that little bit imbalanced in favour of the Rebels& and it shows in gameplay. Garven Dreis is a good support character too& and a host of droid upgrades are included that make this a worthwhile purchase.My one concern as per the X-Wing in the core set remains: this is a very delicate model& the cannons in particular& and needs to be handled with care. A top tip: should the cannons bend out of shape& run a glass of cold water& then hold the model gently in a pair of pliers and steam it over a boiling kettle. Bend the cannons back into shape& then dip the whole thing into the cold  water. For best results& refrigerate for a brief period. This has worked like a charm for my two models that got bent out of shape in transit."
16436,5103,4," Yes& its another tiny space ship for the X Wing game. Those unenlightened who are not fans of Star Wars might wonder why anyone would want to spend so much money on a tiny plastic toy. Some players who own the basic X Wing game may also wonder why they should spend money on another single X Wing rather than buying another copy of the basic set (which is undoubtedley better value for money).Well& the X Wing Expansion does provide several unique elements which you don't get with the basic set. To start with the cards you get include Wedge Antilles& and it seems the model itself is based on Wedge's ship. The reason I say this is because in the attack on the Death Star Wedge is hit on the right engine and has to pull out of the attack& and look there on the model the X Wing has a blackened& battle damaged right engine! Now its that sort of attention to detail that fans like me find hard to resist.As well as Wedge there are cards for Garven Dreis (Red Leader) and more droids and other options to upgrade and modify your ships. So although you might want to stick to buying the basic set if you wanted to build up a squadron of X Wings& its still worth buying the X Wing Expansion just once to get the unique cards& and a slightly distinct model for your game."
16437,5103,4," This can be found cheaper elsewhere. It is a good product and the pre paint is actually decent enough if if you are a miniature wargamer that look suspicious at the word pre painted. The only annoying things is that he does not bring all the possible X-wings pilot cards and upgrades. So for the pilots you still need the starter set if you want Luke Skywalker for example as well as ton of other different ships if you want all the possible upgrades"
16438,5103,3," Purchased this on amazon since the starter set and big ships were much cheaper than everywhere else. However this is not the case with this one& in fact amazon charges more then the RRP. The pre painting on this one was also probably the worst one of the lot I got  so I had it re striped and repainted"
16439,5103,5," Whats not to love about Darth Vader in a tie advance to lead your tie fighters against Skywalker and the rebel scum..."
16440,5103,5," This is a fantastic little model which looks great on the battlefield when flanked by a standard TIE either side.  Great addition to the game& which really benefits from the 2 shields.  Also comes with some great cards."
16441,5103,5," Dont underestimate the trusty old X-wing!After ignoring it for more exotic ships I've come running back. You just can't argue with the stats and the choice of pilots.Lots of world championship squads are just X-wings and for good reason.Check out the stats on Luke with Wedge and Biggs thats a cheap elite team you can get early on and kick some serious ass!With a stat line of 3&2&3&2thats 3 Fire power2 Agility3 Hulland 2 Shields.Pilot cards...Wedge AntillesGarven DreisRed Squadron PilotRookie PilotUpgrade cards...Proton TorpedoesR5-K6R5 AstromechExpert HandlingMarksmanship (This is the one your bothered about)"
16442,5103,5," Awesome looking miniature.  Not had the chance to play with it yet& but really looking forward to getting some long days of dice rolling with my kids."
16443,5104,4," My son  collects all Moshi Momsters and this one was added to it. Good value as some of these are silly prices .."
16444,5104,4," another item bought for my granddaughter.She loves these little creatures and had not seen this one before so was a big hit with her.Very small comparted with other 'moshi' characters but then it is listed ea mini."
16445,5104,5," Good price for this Moshling. My 6 year old was very pleased to add this one to his enormous collection of Moshlings! Quick delivery too."
16446,5104,5," Item arrived early and as described. Great addition to my little girls moshi monster collection. Nephew also collects moshi monsters."
16447,5104,5," My grandaughter specifically asked for this item"
16448,5105,5," Eat a lot of stir fries in my house and my younger brother loves darth maul& so this was a win win. Magnets stick the sabers together which is cool& but when you pick up bigger items of food the magnets tend to pull together which then means you drop your food."
16449,5105,4," I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loved them. Good quality make and design& however we don't know how easy the smooth plastic will pick up food"
16450,5105,5," Great birthday present for boyfriend aged 23 :-)"
16451,5106,5," This nendoroid is so cute and it is my first nendoroid. I bought it for around Â£27& i was kind of scared if it was going to be a bootleg because it was so cheap for a nendoroid& but when it arrived it had a holographic sticker at the front and it was the legit thing~ the seller that i bought it from is A-style.japan ~ this nendoroid was delivered all the way from japan so it dos take around 3 weeks~ it was definetly worth it! â™¥ love this nendoroid."
16452,5107,5," great"
16453,5108,5," Brought for 5 year old son he has played with for many hours now& once shown the first few times how all go together and transform he is able to swap and change to any style he chooses. Great as can mix and match with other sets."
16454,5108,1," I purchased a number of these when they were reduced at at local supermarket. Nearly all of them are now broken. The basic skeleton parts are made from quite a rigid plastic and the ends that clip& are easily broken. The problem appears to be that the ball end joints are quite stiff and difficult to move. When these parts are forced it tranfers the load onto the rigid plastic clip end of the joint causing them to fracture and break.  My son isn't rough with his toys& he usually keeps them toys in their robot form and just uses them as dolls which he wants me to 'make them talk' for him. When he wants them to be transformed he gets me to do it so I know that none of the toys have been forced. These toys are just made from a material that is just not fit for use and Hasbro should not have released a toy that is broken so easily. I have tried to contact hasbro to get replacement parts which I would have been happy to pay for if necessary& just so my son can play with them again. As yet I have had no responce."
16455,5108,4," I have bought this for my sons 7th birthday and I'm sure he will love it."
16456,5108,5," Great price for quality toy"
16457,5108,5," Very fast delivery and very well packed.  Deffinatly recommend&  high quality goods too. I saw this product in Argos for double the price. My 6 year old will love this :)"
16458,5108,5," I bought for my sons 4th b/day& so hasn't been opened yet.. But looks great&hes gonna love it. Also arrived well before the estimated date given .. Very fast delivery"
16459,5108,4," My almost 8yr old is happy& he's enjoying building and playing with his creations.  Instructions seem child friendly& and appears to be pretty well made."
16460,5108,5," Excellent service. Very happy with this purchase."
16461,5109,5," Grandaughter Loved it& that says it all. She has now got several monsters in her collection. I have also purchased a few extra one's as they are a reasonable price."
16462,5110,5," The figure is very well made a must for any one piece fan"
16463,5111,3," I purchased this game for my six year old son who is mad on turtles.The games are great and very educational.We thought...until you lose and one of the turtles says& (YOU MOVE LIKE A SPASTIC BUFALO)...Not the kind of speech I want my children using.Vtech were very apologetic and are looking into the phrasing...something they were unaware of. The games will be updated without that particular phrase."
16464,5111,5," Pat on the back for vtech.educative& entertaining& would like the games to be cheaper though but amazon do have some good offers which can make it affordable and therefore possible for people"
16465,5111,5," My son absolutely loves this. Great way to learn and play at the same time. My son is on the autistic spectrum and things like this have made his learning journey so much easier."
16466,5111,5," Bought this for my 6 year old boy. He loves it. It is one of his favourite innotab games. It arrived on time. Packaging was in good condition. Would recommend."
16467,5111,5," My 7 yo is getting great enjoyment out of this game. It was an excellent price too as it was 25 euro in the local toyshop."
16468,5111,5," Great educational game. Just perfect fir a 6 year old boy who really likes playing thus. Great price and good value ."
16469,5111,5," My 7 year old loves this turtle game and I don't mind him playing as its educational who said learning cant be fun"
16470,5111,5," Very happy& was delivered extremely fast thank you very much"
16471,5112,2," I have Rick from series 7 and 7&5 & but this one is worse figure of Rick. The body sculpt is ok& but that mines face looks like s***. I think only mine is manufacturing defect& because others faces were nicely done. So I have bad luck."
16472,5112,5," This was bought as a Christmas gift for my son. I chose it as the likeness to the character appeared good online and I was not disappointed when it arrived."
16473,5112,5," My son was really pleased with this and he has said it is the best action figure he has. Detail is amazing."
16474,5112,5," Excellent. Came early too..."
16475,5112,5," My daughter loved it"
16476,5113,5," Just what my son was after and at a very good price too! Does what it said on the box"
16477,5114,4," I bought this for gift for the son of one of my friends. He was delighted with it and still plays with it even now. He has lots of adventures with Batman and Superman teaming  up to defeat Killer Croc. Nice bonus is the massive restraints you can place Croc in and a net which can be clipped together."
16478,5114,5," My grandson loves them and takes them everywhere with him& even to bed and has long conversations with them.  He is just 4 and this was one of his birthday present.  Good quality and just the right size for his little hands and pockets!"
16479,5114,4," My 4 year old son really loved this as a present. The only downside with the figures is that the capes easily rips and comes off which has happened to the Batman figure in our case."
16480,5115,5," Really nice figurine& packaging is cool too"
16481,5115,5," VERY G! Love it! Real size blunt!"
16482,5115,5," loving it"
16483,5116,5," kids loved them"
16484,5116,5," this is a present and I'm sure they will love it"
16485,5116,5," great xmas gift"
16486,5117,5," Verry verry happy. Looks great next to my other troopers."
16487,5117,5," great item fast deliver"
16488,5117,5," Well pleased with this very articulate well worth the moneyAnd it talks"
16489,5117,5," great"
16490,5118,5," Was a present. Arrived before specified date. All intact and satisfied. Person receiving this was more than happy with it."
16491,5118,4," Good quality but very expensive and poor value for money"
16492,5119,5," perfect size for cake and grandson loved it"
16493,5120,5," Great challenge.good quality"
16494,5121,5," Happy with product and delivery"
16495,5122,5," Amazing display piece and fits in perfectly with other animated transformers!"
16496,5123,5," My sons new addition to his transformershe loves it !!Transforms into a car !!Doable with out instructions"
16497,5123,5," My son is happy to play with this definitely. It made well& so it is not easy to get damage. great!"
16498,5123,4," It was a Christmas gift for friend's child. They love it. They laughed to set it up with the Chinese instructions manual but it doesn't  take of the toy's value. Child likes it. I would buy it again."
16499,5123,5," This was an excellent toy well worth the money& my Grandson has hours of fun with this."
16500,5123,4," Tnx"
16501,5124,5," Great fairy for all those who have daughters who love to live alongside fairies& and mothers that enjoy too!! Great hard wearing pretty& and great detail."
16502,5124,5," Lovely Quality.  Perfect gift."
16503,5124,3," gift"
16504,5124,5," :-)"
16505,5125,4," my youngest LOVES this. from an adult perspective it is a bit simple& opening jaw and wheels of the feet but no other working parts& a bit on the small side but works fine with 3 1/2| figures (star wars figure size).  fairly robust and appears to be fairly well put together"
16506,5125,5," Kids love it got one for youngest at Christmas had to get another they were fighting over playing with it best present for the kids"
16507,5125,5," Brilliant toy to add to my toy story collection"
16508,5126,5," My son who is 8 years old loves this game and has completed level 4 on it and is so pleased with himself. It is very educational and has helped him immensely with his maths in school. It also keeps him quiet in the car and increases his concentration. Love it"
16509,5126,3," As it was for a present& I cannot say anything more constructive than |it looks OK| as far as a purchase item"
16510,5127,5," Too bad they aren't sold in pack& would love to army build those!The sculpt is great too! Very nice addition to anyone's collection."
16511,5128,4," Perfect"
16512,5129,4," I really wanted this for my child but the I noticed the price and I got to admit it is a bit expensive for at toy like this.Its really nice but the price puts me off.Just take it down a few pounds  and i'll be okay with it."
16513,5130,5," Wouldnt call it a toy& more a collectable. Great condition and good value& over all a very good buy. Could not fault it."
16514,5131,4," Excellent figure! I couldn't recommend this figure more. This figure has a charm to it that just makes you love it from first sight. I'm only onto season 2 of the clone wars but I'm really enjoying it and through this enjoyment I discovered the action figures to the show. I showed interest in this figure from the first time I saw it on another website and knew that I had to order it as soon as possible.The articulation on this bad boy isn't anything to brag about but still has& what I would consider standard for this scale& others may disagree with that statement& saying that it should posses ankle articulation that it unfortunately lacks here but in my opinion the lack of articulation really helps the sculpt along. The articulation this guy has though is enough for most poses on the shelf& this articulation includes: ball jointed neck& ball hinged shoulders and elbows& rotation at the wrists& swivel hips and waist& and finally ball hinged knees. For what I do with my action figures (that coming from an adult collector) the articulation isn't a problem at all.The paint on this figure came out really smooth and neat with no paint smears (although that's not to say they're all that way) and contrasts well over the whole figure. The paint here is one of the things that makes this figure stand out to me with its not quite shiny or matte finish.The quality of the plastic and its durability is one of the things that hit me like a ton of lead as its outstanding and feels really durable and not fragile like a lot of other figures in this line. The only accessory this guy comes with is his iconic blue lightsaber which in turn shares the same quality as the figure itself.Read more â€º"
16515,5132,4," good product& good supplier"
16516,5133,5," It's without a doubt& hands down THE best Indy figure out there (well& apart from maybe the premium format statue). And there are a fair few Jones figures out there these days. He is the only version with two interchangable heads& one with hat& one without& and one of the few with the best 1/6 scale bodies available. Plus he has a set of gloved hands as was featured in Raiders of the Lost Ark& both fisted and gripping versions.One of the best things about him though is the head sculpt. It's hard for sculpters to get Harrison Ford's features right& but this is the best I've ever seen. The paint job may let it down a bit but not much.The clothes are beautifully made and hang just right. The accessories are perfect and plentifull and allows for a wide range of posing and display.I don't think any Indiana Jones collecter would be sorry they bought this as it stands as the ultimate tribute to the original man in the hat!"
16517,5134,5," great"
16518,5135,4," I bought this for two young home-educated relations of mine who are utterly obsessed with playing with Doctor Who figures.Having said that& their interest ends with Sylvester McCoy's era& so they really had no idea as to the identity of the extraordinary little chap with a head that seems to resemble some kind of infinitely more terrifying Mr Claypole. Both figures are very well made and the Sarah-Jane model does actually manage to capture Liz Sladen very well. The children have had her ably assisting each and every one of the first seven Doctors and despite being threatened by Cybermen and the like the figure is still in one piece. As is the figure of the alien Mr Claypole& who was rejected by the children before ever making it out of the packaging on the grounds that& whoever he is& Tom Baker never shared a bag of Jelly Babies with him.As a tribute to one of the most wonderful of all of the Doctor's assistants& this figure definitely fits the bill."
16519,5135,5," I love the shara jane adventures and all her figures"
16520,5135,5," 10 / 10 !"
16521,5136,5," brought this for my lads christmas& very good quaility quick delivery& am very happy with this purchase and would recommend this item"
16522,5137,5," I wasn't sure what to expect from this but found the instructions clear to follow and the completed model holds together well."
16523,5138,5," Brilliant"
16524,5139,5," I got this for my 7 year olds birthday and he loves it. I think its a rather strange idea but he has played and played with it and says it was his best present. If they like Moshi monsters they will probably like this. The trashies are very small and do get lost easily but you can buy smaller sets to add to the collection. Veyr quick delivery from Amazon"
16525,5139,5," My 6 year old grandson says that this was his favourite birthday present and absolutly loves it. He is always playing with it."
16526,5139,4," Unlike the scum drum& this is a reasonably durable product and didn't cost too much at all.The trash packs can be thrown into the back using the lever and it kept him very happy indeed."
16527,5139,5," i bought the trash dump truck for my nephew for his 5th birthday he loves it. They delivered the toy on the day they said it would arrive. Iam very happy with the purchase."
16528,5139,3," This product is ok& my son does like it& but I think its very decieving on the size. It is not as big as it looks I was quite dissapointed to be honest.....but like I say my son likes it."
16529,5139,4," my son got this as a birthday present. he loves it and has been playing with it constantly and has started collecting the trashies. The fold down doors/flaps don't seem to be the sturdiest and are a little tricky to open but they haven't broken yet. It's not too expensive so I would say its been good value given the amount of play that it has generated."
16530,5139,5," thought they are bit childish but all the boys his ages luvs trashies at moment & so bought him all the 3 trucks and sewer as thats the main xmas pres he asked for& he really happy with them & his best presents he said lol& arrived fast and son happy& thanks."
16531,5139,4," Plenty of Trashies to play with&and the various lorry parts that can be manipulated gave my grandchild considerable satisfaction .However closing the lorry was not particularly easy&and needed occasional adult help."
16532,5140,5," If you love the film& I think you will love this Action Figure.The detail is awesome& this action figure looks great on my desk at work and after seeing and loving the film this was a must have for me.The only question would be the price& as it's a fair amount to invest& around 30 GBP I paid& but I saw some vendors wanted twice that if not more.At the end of the day if you are a die hard fan& and are looking for something to bring your work desk to life& or have around the house on show& then I would recommend.I also bought the Striker figure for a friend that is also a fan and he thought it was excellent as well& probably looking at the two I may reconmend Striker over Gypsy Danger but they are both great.To note& these are not really toys in the sense of the word& yes arms and legs etc do move and a lot of thought in my opinion has gone into the design and manufacture& but if you are looking at this for a much younger child& I would say please look on...Otherwise enjoy :-)"
16533,5140,3," good sculpt& very sturdy. An issue with the left leg as it was bent quite badly even though it was brand new and had never been opened"
16534,5140,5," Present for my husband and he loved it so much he isn't taking it out of its box. Thank you"
16535,5141,4," Bought this game for my stepdaughter at christmas and found myself playing it a lot great wee family game well worth it"
16536,5141,5," Bought this for my eldest son (10) and it's a great game to play when you don't have a huge amount of time. Encourages tactical thinking and makes him concentrate. Not overly complicated and there are different levels of play with suggestions for alternative game rules. He found it addictive at first and we played many games one after the other. It's a game he continues to come back to& so some lasting appeal. Overall I would say a good choice."
16537,5141,5," I'd never heard of this game before but it turned out to be a winner& one of those games that was good for a 10 year-old but not tedious for adults.  Simple rules but good fun and each game is short enough to leave you wanting another go."
16538,5141,5," I bought this game for my 10 year old but the whole family love it too. It is simple yet challenging& a family favourite.  Highly recommended."
16539,5141,5," This is another great game from the Green Board Games company. Quick games make it easy to spend a few rounds of Joggle on a dark winter night."
16540,5141,4," Bought for my 11 year old daughter.  Very simple to follow& we enjoy playing it.  Becomes more tactical as you play it more."
16541,5141,4," I bought this as a gift for my nephews but now think that I will be buying for my daughters and to use with my class!"
16542,5141,4," Beautiful strategy game. It makes your mind and your children's mind to be more |efficient| .. I think so .."
16543,5142,5," Great Game. It's a bit like a more sophisticated Monopoly. I play it with my kids to get them a bit of savvy ready for being adults."
16544,5142,5," This is a great product.  It helps you to some extent.  If you are new to investing it will give you an insight in to the investors mind.  It's a bit like monopoly but slower and finding people to play it can be hard.  The people who tend to win at this game are the numerate people (like my wife)!  This is a great safe way to learn and adapt your mind set.  In real life starting to invest can have its dangers if you invest too much too fast it can back fire Robert Kiyosaki can recover faster from a bad investment than you or I.  All that he says is true and if it was not for him and his books I would not have taken a position in Silver or other rental properties.  Once you have read his books you change... you start thinking from a different perspective& I was happy before living in ignorant bliss but now I realise I have lots of work ahead of me to get to where I want to be....However I no longer fear lack of money like I used to and I am now financially more secure and in control."
16545,5142,5," We have both version& that is new version and this version. Both are great simulation game& not a game that you waste time and gain nothing. This is like Chess& that trains your mind.There are so many reviews on this all over the internet& however& one thing that this version& even though old& never be discarded. New version has no actual currency notes (for game) included& instead& it uses ledger. However& this version uses physical game currency. This is very important element as humans remember more what they can tangibly feel or see. It would have been better the new version kept the paper currency."
16546,5142,5," Ok so the old clichÃ© of 'monopoly on steroids' is trotted out for this game - but it is so apt!As part of the Rich Dad franchise this puts lots of the ideas into practice albeit on a fun and risk free basis ($1m note anyone?!)But it is the process of thinking about things differently& most obviously assets and liabilities& that is brought home so well with this game.And for me and my 13 year old son& it has prompted the start of business ideas and even businesses...the Rich Dad knowledge and Cashflow game are that powerful!"
16547,5142,3," For its purpose it is very good to teach someone about expense and liabilities etc. In a digital age when things are wireless& it is pretty outdated. Still& it sits along my RIsk and monopoly board games for those rainy days"
16548,5143,5," I found this to be an excellent extra to the original game& which can become quite dull with just the four shopping lists - maybe more for the parent than the child!  This set includes two new shopping lists and two trollies.  It makes the game longer& to have more variety of cards to turn over before finding the right ones& and it means that more people can play if they wish.  Would recommend."
16549,5143,5," I was very impressed with the speed the items were delivered and was very pleased with the quality and competetive price of the items.I would not hesitate to use Orchard Toys again."
16550,5143,4," My 5 yr old loves this"
16551,5143,5," Excellent family game - very educational too& assisting with word recognition and reading.Adapted rules for my 4 year old granddaughter.  Instead of putting card face down if she did not item for her shopping trolley she held it up and asked if it was on anyone else's shopping list. Game moved more quickly and was good fun.  She is now insisting that mum and dad write a shopping list for her to help when in the supermarket!"
16552,5143,4," Obviously bought this to go with the Shopping list game& which only has 4 shopping carts and 4 shopping lists. Adding the booster enables up to 6 players to take part.The game is very good overall& bought it for my daughter for christmas and the booster pack was a gift for her 3rd birthday in jan. Grandparents& parents& aunties and uncles love this game as much as my daughter does and it can get quite competitive!!"
16553,5143,3," as others with a three-star-rating commented& it is only two more trolleys and shopping lists"
16554,5143,4," We are fans of the Orchard Toys products for children - simple& educational and the kids love them.  We already have the Shopping List game for which these are booster packs.  They just help to expand the game and the children's vocabulary and recognition.  Alternatively buy 2 booster packs and you've got another complete Shopping List game."
16555,5143,5," A great addition to the shopping list game. I play it with my 10 and 4 years old children and they love it. It is also fine to play on its own with the younger child.We've got the fruit extras& too. That makes the game even more interesting and the older child does not get bored as easily as with just the original set."
16556,5144,5," I bought this for a friend and she loved it.  It is the smaller version of one I used to have but had extras such as being able to make stickers.  Good for the price too."
16557,5144,2," bought this for my granddaughter to play with as my daughters had these when they were little.  very disapointed with it& it is a poor imitation and should not be titled |original| as it is not anything like the ones i remember.  alright as a stocking filler&but that is all."
16558,5144,1," I wish I'd taken greater notice of the reviews before buying this& my daughter used it once but was so frustrated by it that has not used it since. It is very poor quality and difficult to use"
16559,5144,1," It was OK but a lot smaller than I remember& a lot smaller.  Its OK.  i wish I had bought a larger scale Spirograph and the one I actually bought.."
16560,5144,4," its was as I remember as a kid it was delivered on time and in great condition . my kids will love it"
16561,5144,5," My daughters really into art so loves this. Its great quality but please be aware that it is just the blue stencil in the pack. To be fair though& for the money I wouldnt expect anymore than that and it does exactly what youd expect from it so i cant complain."
16562,5144,5," My daughter wanted this after I told her about the toys I played with as a child& there are larger sets but best get this one if you're not sure how your child will take to it but kept my two amused for a while great for weekends."
16563,5144,5," I bought this as a gift for a 6 year old and she loved it. Very reasonably priced compared to similar items I've seen."
16564,5145,4," An excellent board game - fun but educational at the same time! The grandchildren become very competitive when playing the Brain Box games& and put we grandparents to shame."
16565,5145,5," I love this product! Even as an adult I found I learned a lot and had a lot of fun& too! This is definitely worth buying - a great way to learn."
16566,5145,5," Rather than buy the run of the mill plastic toy for a birthday present i bought the above present as my grandchild is interested in history and this is an excellent way of learning. I would certainly reccomend these products as they are fun and educational and a reasonable price."
16567,5145,5," We have the world& british history and world history and maths.  Love all of these games.. the difficulty is finding enought time to play with all of them.  Certainly can be used at differing levels from age 5& as you just ask the easier questions or let the kids look at the card again to check their answer.  Educationally tops& and even works for adults after a few drinks.  Granted some facts are a little simple& but for kids the info does sink in just by looking at the colour of robin hoods cap or how many arrows he had.. great gift and wish I lived in the UK to buy more of them for all our friends kids !!"
16568,5145,4," I would recommend this to anyone with a 7+ child (or even 6 yo).  Great way to learn while having fun and the games can be as long or short as you like.  The other advantage is that if there are a few of you playing& the game moves at a good pace as each person only gets 10 seconds to look at their card before answering a question - then it goes to the next player etc...so no getting bored.  We have a few brain box games and all are played regularly again and again."
16569,5145,5," What better way to learn things"
16570,5145,3," Ideal for those people who want to join in but lack any knowledge of the subject. The recommended timings keeps the game moving very well but other aspects of the  rules need some reorganisation to keep everyone interested and involved& especially if 4 or more people play. Too many of the questions have little or no connection to the topic."
16571,5145,2," This World History Pack in the Brain box series is the least popular in our house. It feels like a prototype that should not have seen the light of day. Too many questions are laughable and bear no relation to History. On the Nelson Mandela card one of the questions is `` How many Penguins are shown ? ``. We ended up abandoning the game because we were all laughing too much.The other sets we have& Nature& Kings and Queens& Countries of The World& are all much better."
16572,5146,5," Bought for my niece who really enjoyed it"
16573,5147,5," Kids Love this game.The quality is typical Ravensburger - you know what you are gettingA game that will last.The images different enough to make it playable but not so easy that it is too easy!Enjoy"
16574,5147,4," good game for my 3 and 6 year old girls. they enjoy seeing who can match most cards. only shock was the size i expected a bigger box. but it is a nice game"
16575,5147,5," Great memory game with high quality cards. The only problem is that my three year old granddaughter always beats me at it!"
16576,5148,2," phone much to quiet &how do you expect children to learn if you can hardly hear it & such a waste of money.do not know if I would buy leapfrog again."
16577,5148,2," A very quiet toy& normally that would be good but it's that quiet my granddaughter has to put it to her ear to hear it and that's on the loudest setting"
16578,5148,5," Granddaughter loves walking around like mammy on her phone.Volume very good. Some reviews said volume too low but we didn't think so."
16579,5148,5," My little girl love's this she plays on it all the time I got it for christmas and it's still her favourite toy to play with"
16580,5148,5," My 2 year old daughter loves voilet so had to get her this phone and she loved it educational as well so good all round"
16581,5148,3," Quiet one year old didn't like it. It's to chunky to pretend it's a real phone. 6month old kids would probably like it"
16582,5148,4," My niece-3& and 1 year old nephew love it. It's become something that is in the toy box& but it regularly gets brought out to be played with."
16583,5148,5," THIS IS NOT TO QUIET a fantastic present loved it an so does the little girl who received it xx"
16584,5149,5," Great"
16585,5150,5," The cards are an excellent size and the pictures clear. I played this with my 5 and 3 year old grandchildren â€¦ and loved it. My grandson was able to clearly tell which were the matching pairs because the pictures are such good quality and authentic.A traditional game which can be thoroughly enjoyed by a new generation because of the picture links to favourite characters from Eric Carle stories."
16586,5150,5," Bought these for my granddaughter and grandson& both have been playing contentedly with them. &  and a good price.  Bargain"
16587,5150,5," A household favourite. The pictures are clear& cards are sturdy and easy for children to handle about 4 inches x4 inches. Helps children improve their memory in a fun way. Children learn to take turns in the game and count the number of pairs at the end of the game to determine the winner. They learn to be a bit competitive too! The illustrations are familiar and young children can easily associate the pictures with their favourite Hungry Caterpillar story book. Recommended for 2.5 years up"
16588,5150,5," We have the frozen version of these cards too but these are far better. The pictures are much clearer and more distinctive. Our 3.5 year old loves playing this game and can beat us hands down!  A great purchase"
16589,5150,5," Wonderful first game for the young child whether or not he or she is familiar with Eric Carle's work. Children are able to move from finding matches to playing a spatial memory game."
16590,5150,5," Good selection of pictures mostly from Hungry Caterpillar but a few extras from other Eric Carle stories.  Decent quality and my son enjoys playing it."
16591,5150,5," Love the pictures& Ravensburger's high quality as usual. Bought it as a present and the girl love it! Very fast shipping time"
16592,5150,4," Great. Colourful. Nice little game for the little ones. Would recommend."
16593,5151,2," I'm a child therapist and use and purchase a lot of games to play with the children . I thought this game be good to help with problem solving & challenging children & appeal to the logically minded children and be use it seemed like minecraft .There are two main pieces so you can only play with two players at the most or on your own & bit unusual for games .The game is a bit flimsy made and you have a flip type book which acts as a board & I found this a bit disappointing but I suppose the benefits are that it be easy to transport . The other pieces are cardboard tokens and two plastic pieces that resemble minecraft cubic characters.The idea seem to be about solving different pathways there are instructions and guides but to be honest both myself and the children I work with gave up trying todecode or work it out .So far no child I work with has chosen to continue to figure the game out & although initially they were excited by the boys presentation & instead it has been reinigated to the | boring | pile and as one 9 year old said | a bit to complicated | .It definitely lacks the fun factor and if you buy this you need to be a patient parent and I do think it has a very limited appeal to children . Also feel for what you actually get it is also overpriced."
16594,5151,5," This game is not a |pick up and play in 2 minutes| experience& but working out how to play this is well worth it.  It's an interesting one player puzzle game that teaches anyone from age 8 to adult how to think through some basic programming concepts"
16595,5151,4," This is a great little logic game aimed at the Minecraft generation. It's a little like the game Rush Hour that we love in that it's a one person game and you start on card one and the levels get progressively harder as you move on. You basically have to work out how to get from one place to another on various maps. As it progresses you need to collect gems along the way. My 11 yr old son and 9 year old daughter were captivated by it for a couple of hours and were taking turns in doing the cards. We haven't completed them all yet but they really like it .The different routes come in a cardboard booklet which I was initially a bit disappointed with as I thought it would get bent but it seems to be standing up to my two at the moment. A lot of the pieces are just thick cardboard shapes as well& I would have preferred more durable plastic ones but the gems are plastic.Definitely nice to have something a bit different and I would recommend it for logic loving minecraft fans over the age of 7/8."
16596,5151,3," Code Master is a logic game that you play by yourself& along similar lines to Rush Hour which is also from Think Fun. As with Rush Hour you work your way through a series of increasingly tricky levels where you have to find the solution to the puzzle. In Code Master the goal of each level is to get your avatar to the portal on the selected map for that level.Whereas in Rush Hour it's quick and simple to pick a card and set up the game ready to play& Code Master requires much more setting up. You pick a level (1-60) which will be on one of 10 maps. The level will tell you which scroll you need and how many crystals and action pieces are required to set up the level. Firstly& you set up the map placing the plastic avatar& portal and crystals in the correct places and then you are ready to start placing your action tokens on the scroll â€“ and this is where the 'coding' comes in.Each scroll has positions in which you must place the action tokens for that level. There are three different colours of tokens â€“ red& green and blue with each representing a different type of path. It's the goal of the player to place the tokens on the scroll in a sequence that provides instructions that will guide the avatar to the portal. Once the player has placed all the tokens on the scroll they can 'run' their code and see if it works. If not& then they can 'debug' it and try again.As you progress through the levels the game introduces 'conditional' tokens and scrolls with 'loops'& which does give it more of a programming feel. As a game it is certainly challenging and gets pretty tricky quite quickly. My son is almost eight and whilst he really liked (and understood) the concept he got frustrated quickly.Read more â€º"
16597,5152,5," I researched all sorts of walkers and made my decision to buy this one for my daughter. I was not disappointed. The fact that it's made of wood was a promise of sturdiness& stability and durability. The bottom of the walker is quite low -close to the floor - which makes it even more stable than I thought it'd be. It's not just a walker - it's an attractive storage solution for my daughter's books. She can access them when she wants without any risk. A lovely animal featured maze is cut in both the sides of the walker. Do I need to mention how beautiful the colours are? I don't think so. I'm not a pink colour lover so was pleased that the walker 's girl's version is multi-coloured (yellow& purple& pink& blue and many colours more). My husband who is a designer and cares much about what surrounds him was nicely surprised. What's most important the walker is safe for our daughter (unlike some walkers made of plastic) to use. She loves it. She even sat in it and enjoyed a ride& pushed by mummy. I can recommend it to anyone who is looking for a lasting& safe& multi-functional and beautiful walker for their children."
16598,5152,5," Fantastic this little cart is beautiful"
16599,5153,5," This was a very successful present for a three/four year old. Puppies are usually universally enjoyed and these were no exception. And they had good names. I wish I'd had these at that age (or now really!)"
16600,5153,5," My Niece really loved this gift for her Birthday. She plays with the dogs constantly and also likes the game as well.Great present for youngsters who like animals."
16601,5153,5," Little girl loved this."
16602,5154,5," I bought this for my nieces (8 and 6) and they absolutely love it.  They can play together or with adults and they have been caught just reading the cards.  It also is a really nice springboard for encouraging them to read more stories."
16603,5154,5," Hope our grandson is as pleased with it on Christmas Day as his grandparents are already. If not we'll steal it from him!!"
16604,5154,4," Yes she liked it and it's a good purshase.vvvvvvvvvv good ok fine good value not too good but fine thsnx"
16605,5154,5," Grandchildren enjoyed playing over Christmas and this will probably be a repeat play game."
16606,5154,5," Great game& it feels quite heavy& I haven't opened as it's a gift& but I'm happy with it."
16607,5154,5," I bought this for my grandchildren& they love it we have played it lots of times."
16608,5154,3," The brain box card games are very good.  The box is compact& cards are durable and sturdy and they are stored easily with the egg-timer in the box - it is fun but for the younger children as an adult will need to play along too and read the 'big' words they can't.  It is a good games for observation& counting& colours etc. Set a short period of time to play it as attention can wander if played too long. The games are pitched at different ages so buy the correct age for your child.  I will be buying the older versions when my grandchild reac as it is really educational.  I totally recommend these products."
16609,5154,5," An excellent resource loved by children and versatile in its uses!"
16610,5155,5," I bought this for my grandson's birthday. He loves anything to do with science. I have just seen a video of him using it and he loves it. I would definitely recommend."
16611,5155,5," great experiment kit... have some fun while playing... there's a great idea! all the kids will love it... great buy"
16612,5155,4," Bought for my niece& she had fun playing with it."
16613,5155,5," A very fun an educational kit.This kit will show kids how something as |simple| as water can be fun to play with. At the same time& the science behind the play is explained in a simple& yet effective manner.From soap bubbles to water glass turning& this kit is a guaranteed success for any kid with an inquiring mind.Two thumbs up!"
16614,5155,5," This was a present for my son who loves making potions and experiments. He loves this set"
16615,5155,5," Like all Science4you toys it requires attention and effort. A great way to spend time with the kid. Make sure you wear your worst clothing when doing any Science4you 'cause you'll get really dirty however it's soooo much fun!"
16616,5155,5," I have really enjoyed doing this with my 8 year old& it really makes science fun! I would reccomend this as it is easy to do and has clear instructions to go with it."
16617,5155,4," My four year old loves this& another great game from Orchard."
16618,5156,5," Thoroughly enjoyed by the children - lots of stimulation for little minds and hands!"
16619,5156,3," It's says 120 pieces. I only received 100. If you order be sure to count them."
16620,5156,5," My son was happy when he opened this Christmas present he now wants more"
16621,5157,5," I got this because I'd learned to solve the Rubik's cube but couldn't stand the slow turns of the original cube any longer. I found this is perfect as there are no stickers so there's no icky bits peeling off giving the whole cube a much more stylish feel. It's great for showing off and doing finger tricks however the speed at which it spins does mean that I lose control of how many turns it does at once. Also& a few times it has happened that the center pieces have popped out because of the speed of the finger tricks& but it's not too big an issue as they popped back in just as easily as they came out. The only thing that made me consider not buying this specific cube was that I was told that not having stickers meant that the sides get scratched easily. I would like to address this issue. It is not true. My cube has been through everything: school bags& gravely floors& it fell out of my hands a few times and there are no scratches on it. Overall a great product."
16622,5157,5," I bought this for my son and he doesn't stop playing with it.  No stickers means none to come off.  The squares are a bit loose after much use so can pop off.  They are easily put back together - although sometimes you have to complete it to be sure they are on the right way!"
16623,5157,5," Goods arrived very promptly and quality of cube was good.  Happy with the service and would definitely use again. Thanks"
16624,5157,4," Good quality& bright colours& smooth and quick operation.I would recommend this to anyone.My son is very happy with the swiftness and has improved his solving times immensely."
16625,5157,4," Slightly cheaper feeling that I thought but a good price and it's a decent enough speed cube once worn in!"
16626,5157,4," This Rubik's cube compared to the original cube& which is I believe now produce in Hungary& is A LOT faster.It just arrived today and after having used the one made in Hungary for over a month using this cube improves my time by about 10s. (just now - can't wait to get used to its speed)I have to admit that the cubes to pop out quite easily but has never happened to me while solving the cube.Another big plus is actually that the cube is just different coloured plastic& unlike the original that has stickers which go off quite quickly.The only criticism I have is that it took just over a month to be delivered& I did just pay 6 Pounds for it though.Overall a great cube but the seller takes a bit long and if you don't want to wait just buy it from another company for 10."
16627,5157,5," This is a great speed cube which does what it is described to do. it functions flawlessly and I have no regrets about purchasing this product. I highly recommend this product to cubers who want to go pro or someone who just wants a long-lasting cube that dosen't have stickers that peel off in less than a month. BUY THIS!!!"
16628,5157,5," Excellent for corner cutting& but a bit stiff when out of the box& however because its so cheap it is well worth buying."
16629,5158,5," Fantastic product. Well made and makes counting an telling the time easy. Makes a wonderful present for a young child"
16630,5158,5," Great learning clock& will last for years& very colourful my grandson loves the puzzles& easy to use Love it 5 star"
16631,5158,5," This is a well made& colourful puzzle.  The hands move and although a little old for my grand-daughter& she'll get lots of fun matching the numerals to the pictures.  I'm really pleased with this buy."
16632,5159,5," My 5 year old chose these to buy with her holiday money& we weren't convinced they would get used that much. How wrong could we be!!!!! They are fab& small children can play by using the colours instead of the number of dots& and adults are driven crazy when they can't use a Bendomino because it turns the wrong way! They've given us and our friends and family loads of fun& so much so that I've bought 2 more sets for Xmas gifts& and other friends have bought at least 4 sets among them since playing at our house. So be quick& get them before they're gone!"
16633,5159,5," This is a really great childrens' game for adults! It's an ideal party fill-in while guests are in recovery mode from the usual exertions& and real fun - especially after a tipple or two. It's dominoes with a really interesting difference - spot on& as it were& and the bendy shapes make the game rather less easy to conclude than the standard 'straight brick' version. Not so entertaining with just two players& and probably best if there's between three and six participants. Good value& for sure& and highly recommended"
16634,5159,5," Our 10 year old daughter bought a set of Bendominoes with some Christmas money and we have thoroughly enjoyed playing this very good twist on the standard domino game.  The pieces are lovely to handle& the colours make it easy for younger children to join in and the frustration caused by having the right spots but 'bent the wrong way' makes it highly entertaining for all.  Great game& it's going on our list of 'games we will give as presents'!"
16635,5159,5," Excellent idea for a new twist to dominoes.  You can't always play the tile you would expect to be able to play due to the placement of the dominoes which makes you think harder!"
16636,5159,5,"|"
16637,5159,5," I have a bit of a soft spot for dominoes. As a very small boy growing up in England& I'd visit my Spanish grandfather over in Galicia& Northern Spain& each and every Summer. He'd frequently take me to one of the local village cafes& and we'd sit outside in the sun with his retired friends& playing dominoes. As soon as money was placed on the table to make a game more competitive& my granddad would tactfully exclude me from the activity by making me read a book or magazine.Bendomino is a very simple& but clever and novel twist on the game of dominoes& one which I wish I'd had the gumption to think up myself and take onto Dragon's Den. These dominoes are not rectangular shaped& they're boomerang shaped& which adds an interesting new dimension to the game. As each player adds the next domino& there are no straight lines& but rather curved shapes& which means that a skilful player can now try to block his or her opposition from laying down the next domino& by creating a dead-end curve. It's a small but significant change to a very popular tabletop game& and it works very well.My Spanish grandfather died several years ago at the age of 84& he was a farmer who never retired& always worked 7 days a week& never took holidays& and absolutely adored his family. I work as a solicitor and think that my job is pretty tough& until I remember how hard my grandfather worked. I now own my own holiday villa on land inherited from my grandfather& in the very same village where he spent his whole life. During my holidays over there& I always take my daughter with me - she's now aged 12 - and I still go to the very same cafe where my grandfather used to play dominoes with me& only these days I take my daughter.Read more â€º"
16638,5159,4," In one word FANTASTIC.Great game for all ages.Fun& Fun& Fun.Fiendishly addictive just one more game.Curving the dominoes adds more strategy will I lay a piece bending left or right?A great product& fantastic quality colourful pieces and metal tin to carry them in.Buy you will not be dissappointed."
16639,5159,5," Honestly I expected more of this toy considering the previous reviews on it. The game ends too soon - it takes no more than two minutes and there's no time to see much development or feel any excitement. I don't see how more than two players could enjoy this toy& considering the small amount of time it takes for two people to finish the game. I guess the game would have been much more exciting with more tiles. I won't be buying more sets to check this theory of mine. Overall the build quality is very good& I'm a little concerned with the tin box - the bottom was already scratched on the edges& so I hope it won't rust. The pieces are very well made and look really good. If you're looking for a very quick game this would be your perfect choice. It failed to excite us because we're too old to have problems with concentrating on a game for more than two minutes& i.e. we need something that would require the investing of more time and efforts. I find playing our old original dominoes much more exciting due to its greater amount of tiles and longer playing time."
16640,5160,5," Bought as a present. 5 year old Roald Dahl fan very pleased and has lots of fun making up the stories"
16641,5160,5," Bought for present& it was packaged well and looked good"
16642,5161,5," perfect for small children and helping them with their English language."
16643,5161,5," great for kids"
16644,5162,5," I purchased this as a present for a handicapped boy.He needs things that are sensory and it is often difficlt to find things.However this was perfect and he loves it."
16645,5162,4," Chose this for my 2 year old and she loves it.  It's very striking.  A little |busy| on the fast setting but lovely and soothing on the slower settings.  An excellent sensory toy!"
16646,5162,3," It does what it says - it flashes. Makes a reasonable sound. It has different modes but they are all quite fast. Shame there isn't a mode that flashes more slowly or has all the lights on without flashing. Also a pity the lights aren't in rainbow order - but that's just my strange little preference!"
16647,5162,4," Brought this for my nephew who has downs& and he really loved banging this and the flashing lights. Great gift."
16648,5162,5," Purchased for young boy will limited movement and also partially sighted& he loves it and gets very excited when hears the sounds and reacts to lights sometimes. Great buy."
16649,5162,5," It's really good product as it does exactly what the seller says and it helps in a really fantastic way I would recommend this product to children up to the age of 4 but you can use it for ages 5-10 in certain circumstances the delivery was fantastic and is enjoyed by my daughter"
16650,5162,3," Seems okay bought as a Christmas present for niece with impaired vision. She will probably be happy but not sure about her mum with the metal discs clanking ha ha."
16651,5162,5," bought 4 of these to take to a hen party they were amazing and everyone loved them - so much so that they did not come home again - would definitely recommend these"
16652,5163,4," I got this to go with an innotab for my five year olds birthday. I also bought him the disney Cars game.This game is easier than the Cars game and doesn't cause any of the frustrations through not being able to do sums etc.[he's only just started school].He really enjoys playing this& 'though I feel it is quite simple and that at his age its appeal may not last too long.I am glad I bought it as he likes Thomas and the fact that it's quite easy is a positive for me."
16653,5163,5," Brought this for my son's 4th birthday he thinks it great& lots of different things to on it and different levels.  The delivery was great as well& it took about 4 days from ordering until delivery& which included a weekend"
16654,5163,1," Very disappointed brought this for my 2yr olds birthday& when product arrived says on the box doesn't work with innotab max but in description says it's compatible with all innotab!"
16655,5163,5," I bought this game for my 3 year old son to use on his InnoTab. It is a great little game and my son loves it. My son found it easy to use and played with the game for hours on end until his batteries ran out. He loves it so much he asks me to buy batteries for the InnoTab every time they run out so that he can get back to playing it again."
16656,5163,5," My son four finds this easy an engaging graphics as per innotab sound great too games range from numbers to letter's to shapes and recognition of words basic controls so e advanced but willbe easy to learn has other section on it too for taking photo an making music an making own story book also comes with e book great for thomas fans"
16657,5163,5," My young grandson loves Thomas and this has given him a good introduction to his innotab. It is easy to use."
16658,5163,5," Excellent learning toy& Kids take to it like a duck to water. its a great learning tool and fun. Good buy."
16659,5163,5," I purchased this item for my 3.5 year old nephew and have not been disappointed. He was soo excited to open this game on christmas morning! He absolutely loves this game. These games can be a bit pricey but I got this item for Â£13.49 which I feel is great value for money. Thank you amazon :)"
16660,5164,5," Good game& exactly what I was looking for."
16661,5165,4," Let's just start this off by saying Domino Express doesn't make any noise& doesn't require batteries& doesn't run out or wear thin within a few months and doesn't require any further apps or packages to be purchased in the future to ensure it works. My sons face seriously brightened up when I pulled out this toy/game.In the box you will find 2 parts of the bridge that easily clip together& 1 bag of red dominoes and 1 pack of multicoloured dominoes"
16662,5165,5," My daughter loves this game and has had many hours of fun playing with it and inventing new lay outs. Certainly a good buy!"
16663,5165,5," Purchased for my seven yr old son for Xmas and he has had hours of fun making various different paths and watching it fall highly recommend this product"
16664,5165,4," Christmas present for 7 year old nephew. He really liked it but I wasa little bit suprised that some of the rally is pre built. Great little thing though kept him quiet all of Christmas."
16665,5165,3," Long and inspires you to create your own designs. Bad thing: instructions aren't clear and not easy to set up."
16666,5165,5," Bought this for as a gift for a 7 year old. It's ideal& not too big and shouldnt take too long to set up."
16667,5165,1," My boys decided he wanted this when he saw the advert for Domino Express. They arrived and straight out of the box they looked like cheap plastic tat. They fitted together badly and fell over on their own. Save your money& these are rubbish!"
16668,5165,1," Very poor domino set& each piece is very light plastic and easily falls over making it hard to line up.. The pieces in a line often break off& you need multiple steps to create any sort of wow factor.  I wouldn't waste your money."
16669,5166,5," This was a gift for my 7 yr old daughter and she absolutely loves it. She is currently doing this at school - learning to use adjectives and describing things with better words. We play in the car& and it has even replaced the bedtime story a few times - we make our own stories up! It was originally bought for a plane journey and i know it will be gr8. The best thing is that my daughter loves the fact that the stories we make are different each time and whenever you see a picture you've had before you always remember the story so you can tell it without the cards. Its remebering a story through pictures and a brilliant way to encourage vocabulary. I'll definately be purchasing other similar products."
16670,5166,5," These story cubes were a Christmas present for our Grandchildren& as there's five in one family it's really hard to find a suitable present for them all& from the age of 5years to 13years they all think the story cubes are 'GR8'. The competition is good for all ages. Completely portable. They can take them anywhere. Recommended for any age. thanks:)"
16671,5166,5," I bought three packs of this product for my grandchildren who range in ages from 3 years to eight years.  They love them.  They can play together or alone making up stories.  These cards stimulate the imagination and can be played at all levels& adults as well as children."
16672,5166,5," A fantastic resource for allowing creativity and inspiring imagination! I bought this to use in school for Thinking skills and the chldren really enjoy using it."
16673,5167,4," Excellent delivery time. The game requires quite good knowledge of equivalent fractions otherwise it can take a long time for each player to work each one out. Definitely for mathematicians who like a challenge as some are quite tricky! (Of course you can always cheat and look at the answer card.)"
16674,5167,5," Good value quick delivery"
16675,5167,5," nice"
16676,5168,5," Christmas present"
16677,5169,5," Really nice little gift for Christmas for fans of Doc McStuffins. Excellent quality product at a great price. Great buy"
16678,5169,3," i got these for my 2 year old little girl as she loves doc mcstuffins. Price was very fair and delivery was excellent the only thing i was disappointed with is that the dominoes are made of card i was hoping for proper dominoes but the bag is lovely and will be used would recommend these though."
16679,5169,5," great item and hours of fun x"
16680,5170,5," grandaughter thrilled with it &is only three but managed with help to figure it out would recomend it for other little girls"
16681,5170,3," my daughter had this for christmas. she much prefers the other games like scooby doo and spongebob. not much to this game. she gets bored with it"
16682,5170,4," If your child loves hello kitty  then should be added to your collectionMy daughter loved the stories to this game I like the fact you have a couple of games and stories to entertain your child.Definitely recommend it for a younger child.."
16683,5170,5," Very good product.My girl very happy for this tab.She like it.I very happy for my girl.Thank for fast delivery.and finish."
16684,5170,4," This was a ptresent for my 6 year old grand daughter. She liked it as she had others  similar and enjoyed them"
16685,5170,1," Had the same problem as other buyers are now quoting& the cartridges advertise as 'works with all innotab systems' spent lengthy amounts of time trying to load it and still wouldn't work so contacted Vtech who told us that 'Hello Kitty' is not compatable with Innotab Max.  So am in the process of returning the cartridge."
16686,5170,1," Very disappointed ~ Says in description for all innotab systems but when arrived there was a small sticker which doesn't show in picture saying not compatible with innotab max ðŸ˜ž now going through process of returning this and 2 other games with same problem. Daughter only had 1 game to play with on Xmas day"
16687,5170,5," my only commentary is thar this game should exist in Portuguese language. i don't understand how one of the languages that most that is used by so many people in the world (it's the 6th most used in the worl by 176 million people) and you can't find products like this in this language."
16688,5171,5," Another hit from Orchard Toys -  they really do great& FUN& educational toys& and this is another fine example of them getting it right! It can be played in several different ways& making more interesting and pliable to a preschoolers attention span. Plus& the kids can grow up with it as they start to spell out words& and make up silly sentances with their cards...one for all the family to enjoy!"
16689,5171,5," I bought this for my 3 yr old son to play after he returned home from nursery (and also to limit the amount of TV watching that tended to happen in the afternoons). Well& it is such fun - we all play it but my son really enjoys playing with his Grandpa and not only do they practice the letter sounds (using phonics) but make up silly sentences and then roll around the floor laughing. I have also noticed that my son has started to make up some of his own rhymes& which he will sing to popular tunes like |Twinkle twinkle little star| and |Incy Wincy Spider|. It's very durable with brighly coloured cards made of very firm cardboard. I would highly recommend it both for educational purposes and as a way to have interactive fun."
16690,5171,5," I bought this for our holiday to England& it was bound to rain at some stage"
16691,5171,5," This game is excellent for children who are getting ready to learn to read. The rhyming cards are colour coded so children who don't understand rhyming can still play and learn. There are several games you can play with the cards and it's great for making up silly sentences. Great game"
16692,5171,4," Took this on a camping trip to entertain the children. The name really appealed to them! My three year old loved the game and found it very simple to play. Need a large table or floor to play on as there are lots of cards."
16693,5171,5," This game is excellent for children who are getting ready to learn to read right through to those who already can. The rhyming cards are colour coded so children who don't understand rhyming can still play. There are several games you can play with the cards and it's great for making up silly sentences. It's one of the best Orchard games we have."
16694,5171,5," This was bought as a present and it is much played with& much to the annoyance of the parents. In the end they are happy& because daughter is learning through play."
16695,5171,5," Great for pre-school children - lots of good feedback from parents about this fun and educational game"
16696,5172,5," I bought this for my son's fourth birthday and he loved it. Great for those learning phonics as they have to think of animals beginning with the letter they land on. Now he's got used to knowing which animal begins with which letter you make it harder as it has to be an animal from a particular habitat depending on which colour you roll for example& animal that lives in the ocean& jungle& sky etc. Fantastic game& fab for learning letters and animals!"
16697,5172,5," my daughter loved this game... we play it acting out the animals we name. Everyone can participate and it is careful not to leave anyone behind (the points along the way ensure everyone pretty much stays together during the game). Great for 4-5 year olds"
16698,5172,5," Lovely educational game! Happy with the quality of the product."
16699,5172,4," Surprisingly difficult!"
16700,5173,4," My six year old daughter loves these and she's pretty maths phobic. We're all enjoying playing. However& we've covered the aaaah's with an x and a - symbol as we felt we needed more sums. Looking forward to getting the next stage when she's cracked this level."
16701,5173,5," A very easy way to practise maths. Great quality too both my 6 year old and 8 year old enjoyed playing this"
16702,5173,3," It was not clear that only numbers 1&2&3&4&5 and 10 are on the dice and as a maths tool the two sides of the dice that say aaghhhhh seem pointless and my daughter wasnt impressed. Now we are conned into buying the next pack to get the numbers up to 12!We wanted a tool for times tables but be clear& if thats what you want you need to buy two packs and role one dice from each pack....grrrr"
16703,5173,5," Bought this little game for my Granddaughter's 7th Birthday. She was thrilled as it is ideal to put in her bag to take to friends houses. She loves playing game and I thought this was just a bit different from the normal board games. I would recommend it as it helps get the adults brains working when playing with her."
16704,5173,4," This has been a good purchase. Children have enjoyed playing the games& lots of fun. Easy for children to carry around when visiting friends and relatives."
16705,5173,5," good quality& educational game and loved by granddaughter& would buy again for someone else& very pleased.  Looks bigger in picture but does not matter."
16706,5173,4," An excellent& fun way to practice various numeracy skills. Game can last as long as you like& I found kids make up their own rules after a while. Brill!"
16707,5173,5," I bought this as a present for 6 years old girl. Now in school they start to learn numeracy and I hope this game will help her with that."
16708,5174,5," Bought as a Christmas present for my four year old grandson.  He loved it and it looked as though there was plenty of scope for many more hours of play."
16709,5175,5," This game is great fun for dinner parties with a group of 6 or more players. I would thoroughly recommend it!"
16710,5175,4," Great game - don't take too seriously.  Value for money and would recommend.  Played it when family was over after dinner and enjoyed."
16711,5175,5," I also got the mime and humming game as well. It's so much fun& we were crying with laughter.ðŸ˜‚"
16712,5175,5," Quick delivery. Had a good time playing this game."
16713,5176,5," Great small gift. Very pretty .Fast delivery. Enjoyed making it together and seeing the end product."
16714,5177,5," This is a much simpler and less fiddley version of the number jumbolino game. Nice bright simple pictures& a must have for any peppa pig fan. My just 3 year old finds the actual game quite tricky but can play it with help"
16715,5177,5," Great fun with an alternative dominoes set. Really colourful and teaches colours and numbers.Worth the money. Peppa Pig fans will love this game"
16716,5177,5," Daughter loved this.  Thick cardboard pieces.  The frame parts got bent quickly& but it doesn't detract from her game."
16717,5177,5," Bought for Grandaughter who is Peppa Pig mad.She'll love this."
16718,5177,5," Not what I was expecting but good all the same."
16719,5178,5," I bought this for a recent family get-together. Now& this was a collection of adults and they were expecting an afternoon of lazing in the sunshine while polishing off a couple of boxes of wine. However& the opportunity to watch my father& notoriously pompous and an extraordinarily bad loser& tackling an egg and spoon race like there was an Olympic gold waiting for him at the end of it was just too delicious for me to resist.This set comes with everything you see in the picture plus appropriate instructions in three languages. These do seem to suggest that this is a child's game but I see no reason why grown-ups can't get a piece of that action. The assembled crowd that afternoon certainly saw it that way - after some initial grumbling and groaning anyway. The various bits and pieces are very helpfully provided in four colours which& with eight adults& was clearly going to mean two in each team. That's where things started going just a tiny bit wrong. Nobody wanted my father on their team& given that he was bound to take the whole thing too seriously. And nobody wanted me on their team either& given that I 'throw& run and catch like a girl'. Now& I can't deny that accusation (it's these moobs I think)& but I must question why any of that might be a negative thing. Rather tragically& that put us both on the same team. The only good thing about it was that I made sure we were the Pink Team. You should have seen his face.We set up the start and finish lines and got cracking with the first event - the bean bag race. I was the winner of that one although not& as one of my opponents so harshly suggested& because of my fat head. Actually& it wasn't my opponent at all... for some reason it was my own team-mate. He had his own chance to shine in the next event& the sack race.Read more â€º"
16720,5178,5," I bought two of these for a family get together and they proved to be a great success with everyone from aged 3 to 63.  I did wonder if the sacks would be very strong but they proved to be extremely durable.  Great value for money and will give pleasure for years to come."
16721,5178,5," I bought this for a recent holiday with family.  There were 19 of us ranging in ages from 6 weeks to 55yrs and I wanted to bring out the child in all of us so thought this would be fun.  We'd hired a photographer to take pics of us as a group as it was a bit of a family reunion and we set this up while she was there and she stayed to take pics of us all being big kids and having fun.  The equipment is basic but good quality. The sacks were big enough and strong enough for all the adults (and we have some large ones in our family!) and the kids thought they were great.  The Egg and spoon race was great& the eggs are a little on the light side so fell off quite easily but still good fun.  We did various races with the bean bags& adults had them on their heads and kids crawled with them on their backs.  The only thing that was a bit of a let down were the 3-legged race bands& they were really too big and came undone very easily.As school sports days are so non-competitive these days it was great to go with tradition and battle it out.  We added in some of our own races& buggy races for the babies etc and everyone said it was the best day of the holiday!  Needless to say we got some fantastic photo's of us all having genuine fun& I haven't laughed so much in ages!  Would deffinately recommend for a large group.  I'm planning to use the set at the youth club that I work in soon as I think anyone can have fun with this set& even hormonal teens!"
16722,5178,4," I bought this based on others' feedback and the fact that it suddenly had a price drop.  I was a bit surprised to receive a product from tesco (no where on this product description does it state that is a tesco direct product).  I'm now very glad that I didn't pay the original price as it's only Â£14 on tescos and I could have used reward vouchers instead.That all said& it looks like a good product though i'll be making some bean bags as these are too small and too light for the job!"
16723,5178,4," Good& fun product. Everything works really well and does what it's supposed to do. This was used with kids ranging in age from 3 to 12 and they all enjoyed it. The only bug bare is that the eggs get squashed very very easily and its not possible to help them regain their shape."
16724,5178,5," I read some reviews and now that we have used them can confirm they are great fun for children and adults. The sacks can fit an adult which is surprising. The egg and spoon I would recommend you use a hard boiled egg& as the plastic balls supplied are a little too light and will easliy fall off the spoon. Real eggs work perfectly."
16725,5178,5," A great success when the extended family get together! We had young and old racing in the nearby field& with sacks& three legged and egg and spoon! Good sturdy equipment and enough for four to compete which is enough as long as the races are not too long. A great fun afternoon filler."
16726,5178,4," I live in Italy and got this out for a play date with Italian friend who had never seen these games .  The kids enjoyed it. You can make up your own games& relay and combination. Even throwing bean bags in a bucket. It quite easy and inexpensive and the children loved it."
16727,5179,5," Made a great gift"
16728,5180,2," not much of a puzzle& more of a decoration. bit pointless"
16729,5180,5," A good dexterity toy"
16730,5180,5," good"
16731,5181,5," lovely for little girls for christmas"
16732,5182,5," This jigsaw is a little bit more interesting than your normal jigsaw. The edges are not square and it is great to teach kids how to master the art. Each room is a different colour and the pieces can be matched by colour& as well as by picture. Lots to discuss after the jigsaw is complete. My 3 year old will pick out this jigsaw before any other - a great educational toy."
16733,5182,5," This and all the other Orchard jigsaws have been big favourites in our children's toy cupboard.  A great choice for young children - nice big pieces and lots of content to discuss once the jigsaw is put together."
16734,5182,5," Bought this jigsaw for my granddaughter's second birthday.  She adores it& the pieces are a good size and each room is a different colour with so much to talk about in every room.  Great educational value.  Highly recommended."
16735,5182,4," Another great jigsaw from Orchard Toys. Everything that my recently turned 3 Year Old likes in a jigsaw - big& bold and busy. Definitely more challenging than previous purchases from the Orchard Toys jigsaw range& but not to the point where tantrums ensue : )  My Daughter actually doesn't recognise it as a Doll's House and disputes the title (she's feisty!)& prefering to call it The House Jigsaw and I tend to agree with her on this point. So& apart from the title& no quibbles whatsoever. We would definitely recommend it : )"
16736,5182,4," Bought as a gift& but my 4yr old son insisted on testing it first!  He was able to do it in a number of different ways (colours/pictures/edges) and thoroughly enjoyed it.  We talked about the various rooms as suggested& and I can imagine it would have been very helpful when he was younger.  The 2-yr old we gave it to is also having fun with it apparently!"
16737,5182,4," I was very pleased with this puzzle and its a favourite with my 2 1/2 year old grand-daughter. The pieces are large and easy for little fingers to pick up and all different shapes. Its colourful and there is so much detail in each individual room of the dolls house& which can lead to questions like |how many clocks are there in the house| or |which animal is lying on the bed|. So it is excellent from an educational point of view encouraging observation& counting& colours etc. My only criticism is that it is not quite as durable as I would like& some of the paper is beginning to come away from the cardboard backing. However& this may be because it gets a lot of use."
16738,5182,4," Bought this for a 3.5 year old as I thought that the irregular shape would confuse her for a while and make her think a bit.She got it sussed immediately!  Only 25 pieces make it too easy - my mistake for not checking properly.  Liked the Man doing the hoovering!  I think the real merit of the puzzle is in the pictures.  Lots to talk about - straight learning eg colours& names of furniture& parts of house& etc.  Also& good for lots of discussions - what happens in this room - cooking& sleeping& etc? Is there anything you like best and/or anything you do not like that happens in a room?  What is your favourite room in the house? What would you like to add or change in a room& etc. (discovered another child was terrified at night because& from her bed& she could see a china tiger with its bared teeth sitting on a shelf"
16739,5182,5," I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old puzzle addict daughter and it is possibly her favourite ever. The coloured rooms seemed to make it easier to complete than some of the other Orchard Toys puzzles she has for the same age range but I think this puzzle will continue to appeal for several years versus many others that once mastered become redundant. Our whole family love the dolls house - there is so much to talk about - my daughter loves to make up stories based on what's happening within the house. Highly recommended."
16740,5183,5," This domino set is colourful& sturdy and of good quality.  My daughters love matching up the characters and it gives lots of opportunities to talk about familiar fairy tales and characters."
16741,5183,5," Very happy niece on her birthday. She loves playing with this. Arrived promptly. What more can I say - nice gift."
16742,5183,5," My 5 year old daughter had this as a present last year.  Her friend enjoyed playing it as much as she did so I bought one for her as a present too. Nice chunky pieces with bright colourful pictures.  We all enjoy having a game."
16743,5183,4," Kids love it and have been playing with it lots."
16744,5184,5," An excellent game& and & when worked with the French version& will be extremely useful for my students"
16745,5185,5," My wee boy loves playing with the Tap A Shape& he also plays with it at Nursery. We create shapes& building and letters anything we can to help the fun learning experience"
16746,5185,2," This was not the product listed but a similar one from another manufacturer. Ordered on behalf of my wife for her grandson& she decided it was good enough to keep& but annoyed that no explanation was given that this was not as described. Also almost double the price of the genuine ELC product"
16747,5185,5," This is part of a gift purchased for my 3 year old grandson& and not yet given. It appears to tick all the boxes& and I'm sure that he will enjoy using it"
16748,5185,5," My son really enjoyed this&he plays it at his nursery so I thought it would be nice to buy him one&arrived quickly."
16749,5186,5," My son aged 6 and daughter aged 2 have had great fun using this set.For my 6 year old& the sorting and counting is helping him with his numeracy skills both at home and at school.My 2 year old is using her time and concentration to help her with her hand eye skills.I also purchased the tub of teddies to go alongside this which has made for extra fun play and learning of course!"
16750,5186,5," I'm very happy with this item. I bought for my Autistic son to strengthen his motor skills.  Also to count& and to recognise numbers.."
16751,5186,5," Well made learning resource"
16752,5187,5," I bought this item for my 3 year old son and he loves playing the game.  Very good quality and will last a long time.  My sons nursery also provides this game to the children"
16753,5187,5,""
16754,5187,4," Bought this for my 4yr old who has really enjoyed learning how to play it& nice sized cards for little hands& clear pictures on different coloured backgrounds that avoid confusion.  The box is twice the size of the cards for some reason..."
16755,5188,5," I have twin grand-daughters aged 9yrs who are struggling with academic work but these dominoes are helping them to learn whilst they play. the dominoes themselves are made from sturdy board which will last well despite sticky fingers and some rough handling! Love this whole range of toys."
16756,5188,5," My son is nearly 5 and he really enjoyed playing the game.  It was really good for his observational and concentration skills and was a great game to play as a family.  I can imagine for children at the youngest end of the recommend age limit it will be a good game to encourage their recognition of different animals and observational skills and will certainly grow with them over time.As with all Orchard Toys games we have had experience of& the game pieces are extremely strong and robust made from thick card which makes them very hard to bend or break.  They are ideal for little hands to be able to pick up and hold.  The only thing I would say is that when children are trying to hold 7 of these at once they are quite a handful and my son did struggle to hold all of his dominoes at the start of the game.I would say this is a very family friendly product that I can see my young daughter enjoying playing with her brother when she gets a little older.For the price I think this is very reasonable& and& given the quality good value for money.  I would recommend this product - I think it is a great quality game that is lots of fun and will last your child for a good few years."
16757,5188,5," A great purchase& colourful& durable and educational too. Big bold (friendly looking) animal images& and a good size for little hands to grasp. I have bought many 'Orchard' products and are always a winner with both children and their parents. Would recommend."
16758,5188,5," I bought this game for my young pre school grandchildren in the UK and overseas.  Excellent for counting out cards to players& turn taking& colourful& keeps childs interest and attention and fun for participating adults too!"
16759,5188,5," My 2-year old loves matching the animals although he hasn't grasped the whole concept of dominoes just yet.  The pictures are consistent with the other orchard toys games which show animals (eg Old MacDonald Lotto) which means he doesn't get confused."
16760,5188,5," Our 3 year old granddaughter absolutely loves this game and her older sister is happy to play it with her too. It is a game we can enjoy with her as a family and helps observational skills& logic& learning about not always winning being ok"
16761,5188,5," These are great for my 3 year old. It's a nice game for a bit of family time. The cards are a great size and strong and sturdy and the pictures are nice and clear."
16762,5188,5," excellent way of teaching children to recognise animals and how to match them up with each other and interact with all the fammily"
16763,5189,3," Cheap and cheerful but giving us hours of fun"
16764,5189,5," Excellent."
16765,5190,4," Bought this for my 6 year old daughter. She thinks it's okay and plays with it once every couple of months now.The idea of the game is very simple& and as such doesn't hold the attention for very long. It's entertaining enough in small bouts (no more than 10 minutes at a time in my house)& but quickly becomes very samey.It provides children with competative opportunities to practice some sums& and even a little strategy& so there's good learning potential in it.Overall I'm glad we've got it for occasional use& but it won't be used often."
16766,5190,5," Bought this for my son and it is a great way to learn number bonds.  I work in a school and showed it to the year 2 teacher who thought it looked great. So I have bought her this for Christmas!"
16767,5190,5," A very simple but sturdy game& perfect for a quiet evening without the tv on and extremely educational too !"
16768,5190,5," An excellent indoor game for kids and adults alike. We bought it some 1 month back and are liking it a lot. The game is a mix of luck and strategy"
16769,5190,5," My son is four and a half and is just starting to add and subtract and this game can be easily adapted to give many maths learning games."
16770,5191,5," Great product.Very colourful.Easy to use.Great for learning the alphabet.I would recommend this product for young children."
16771,5191,4," Nice and colourful and good size. My 20 month old loves them and has learnt some numbers so well worth it."
16772,5192,4," Good item& hours of fun for young ones&"
16773,5193,5," Fabulous quality jigsaw.  Absolutely engrossing.  Didn't want to stop once I'd started.  Definitely recommend this to avid puzzle fans.  Happy to do business again."
16774,5193,5," An excellent puzzle which needs good lighting to be able to follow parts of the picture properly"
16775,5193,5," This puzzle is going to be amazing - I haven't started it yet but I have opened the box and so I know! Lucky enough to have a sister who is giving me a 2000 piece portable jigsaw board for my birthday (no more sheets of mdf!) and this will be the first puzzle I shall do on it. A simply beautiful picture."
16776,5193,5," 100% as expected"
16777,5194,5," good value for money. nice weight  clear dots"
16778,5195,5," I bought this for my son who is almost 7.  He really enjoys trying to blow up my husbands battleships!  If the game is a long one then they just cover the board up by hanging a magazine over both sides and then they continue it the next day!  Great game& good for practicing numbers& letters and grid ref. too."
16779,5195,5," Very good game not too difficult but with a twist from the original. 5 year copes well in a team but tends to lose concentration. Think that's why recommended age is higher"
16780,5195,4," Great short game for children aged 8-12.  Game lasts approx 10-15 minutes and is easy to grasp for younger children.  A classic game that appeals to young and old."
16781,5195,4," The game is simple in terms of materials& with two boards and a various sized ships& but engaging and my six year old son loves it. It's a good game for improving children's memory and spatial awareness. The boards fold up so that all the counters and ships can be transported easily. The game arrived promptly and is good value for money."
16782,5195,4," This was given as a gift for my son's 6th birthday. It's a great old fashioned game that makes him think&add up and plan...oh and cheat when he gets stuck!!He loves it and will have many happy hours playing it in years to come"
16783,5195,5," Great fun and good for helping children with their grid coordinates. The plastic pieces are not too flimsy and this game should last a fair while. Worth the money in my opinion."
16784,5195,1," Very disappointed to receive today - 6 days after ordering& having paid Â£5.13 postage - a different battleships game to the one shown in the seller's photographs.  I specifically ordered the game from these sellers as it showed the large battleships grid - not the smaller one (on the game I received) which only has a grid ranging from 1-10 vertically  and A to I horizontally compared to 1 to 8 up to 14 vert. (it's a hexagon) and A to O horiz.  on the version that I wanted and is shown in the photos. So the item delivered is a much more limited game.  Product misdescription.  Have contacted seller and awaiting full refund including extortionate postage charge."
16785,5195,5," An enjoyable competitive game for children and adults alike. Has helped to develop my sons concentration too. Well built& has been taken out many times and is still intact."
16786,5196,4," pleased"
16787,5197,5," Not seen this version before. Made a good present for my daughter and family."
16788,5197,5," Great game for family& tin box keeps it all in one place"
16789,5198,2," This game is brilliant& my nephew had one exactly the same as this from America& and all who played it (adults included)& thought it was thoroughly enjoyable!However& when this one came for my daughters birthday& the condition was awful! The box was damaged& it was clearly a second& and had been used! The scoring pad was folded and dented with writing. The dominos were some wrapped in dirty cling film& and some not wrapped at all! A lot of them were marked& and chipped too!! Had my daughter not been desperate to receive this as a birthday present& I would have returned it!"
16790,5198,4," Disappointed with the tin as it had previously had a sticky label on it which had left a dirty residue which is hard to shift.  Also& itt took me a while to locate the train hub which turns out to be a flimsy plastic job.  It is to be a Christmas gift so not sure if it will be received well."
16791,5198,5," A very nice set overall. The dominoes feel good quality& the metal carry case is a great touch and a nice size and the instructions& while complicated in some parts& are simple and clear to follow.The game itself is great fun and something everyone can enjoy. The more you play it& the more tactical and crafty you can get."
16792,5198,3," A good item I would have given 5 stars but the case was dented& I did not notice this until I had glittered the dominos otherwise I would have sent it back for replacement.  The case is a great idea better than a cardboard box for children!"
16793,5198,5," Brilliant game for adults as well as children play it most weekends"
16794,5198,3," Just opened it and found it was previously used although bought it as new.Fortunately all pieces seem to be here but score pad appeared to have been used and not all the dominoes are in their sealed packaging"
16795,5198,5," Great game to enjoy with the whole  family ."
16796,5198,5," This is the best game ever. Very enjoyable"
16797,5199,4," Bought as a present.  Nice Quality. Very pleased."
16798,5200,5," DominoesI was searching for presents for 3 boys& 2 aged  5"
16799,5200,5," Hours of fun with these durable and well made dominoes.Good price includes some instructions on games you may not know of and all in a proper tin boxIf this is a 'toy' then at 60yrs of age it's time me and my mates at the pub grew up!"
16800,5200,5," The Dominoes are 52 x 26 mm x 8mm thick& with radiuses on the corners"
16801,5200,5," WE first saw this when we visited some friends and were challenged to a game by their grandchildren Great game and recomnmend even for oldies!"
16802,5200,5," My wife and I went round to my sisters house for a meal and after everything had been tidied away they asked us if we would like to play a game of Chickenfoot we looked very puzzled and asked what on earth is that& so out came the 9 spot colored dominoes and play commenced. Well it was one of the best evenings ever we had a lot of fun and the following day I ordered my own set from Amazon. Chickenfoot rules I printed off from the internet and keep them with the dominoes.They are extremely well made& and will last for many years&they are suitable for all ages& I am in my 60s& Good fun for all."
16803,5200,1," WARNING: twice I ordered this domino set& hoping to get the tin shown in the illustration. However& both times the item sent was NOT in this package& but in a much less attractive tin& even though I specified when returning the first one& exactly what the problem was.This very disappointing as although Amazon refunded me and promised to investigate& the issue was never cleared up."
16804,5200,5," Very well made set apart from no pips so they will not spin'quick delivery&used every week& very pleased with the price."
16805,5200,4," Nice feel to these and i like the sound they make.However& i do have quite a few with some small chips on the edges.My Grandson loves playing dominoes and these double 9s are a good way for him to learn new counting skills and to develop his concentration. At only 3 and a half  he still quite often wins and that's without any help.The size of these dominoes are exactly the same as those sold in ASDA but they only sell double sixes."
16806,5201,2," Not much going on with this - there are only 3 shapes (circle& square and triangle)& which is not mentioned on the information before you buy it& so all in all a waste of money."
16807,5201,5," Not opened product yet as its a christmas present but looks fantastic im sure my little one will have so much fun with this."
16808,5201,5," Perfect for teaching shapes - my little girl and my niece love doc mcstuffins keeps them happy and entertained"
16809,5201,3," This game is ok. But I think it is designed for younger children than what is stated on the box."
16810,5201,4," Purchased this for the nursery I work at& children loved the character but found the shape sorting a little tricky as it is quite small parts."
16811,5201,5," Great game hard easy to use love thisGreat bargain prizeThanks for the cheap  deal"
16812,5201,5," Mu daughter loves doc mcstuffins and its great she can learn about what shapes are what!"
16813,5201,5," great for birthday pressies expecially at that price"
16814,5202,4," I bought this as a present for my mum and she was very pleased with it. The set looks good and is 'solid'& and the box is very smart. Overall& I think it is worth the price."
16815,5202,5," Great quality& lovely box and pieces"
16816,5203,4," Great product& quality feel."
16817,5204,4," Very thought provoking& some I found to be impossible which& I suppose& is the purpose of the game."
16818,5204,5," Good product as described"
16819,5204,5," great"
16820,5204,4," fine for what it was"
16821,5205,1," Unfortunately one of the dominoes in the box was really badly damaged so it had to be sent back. My parents also have this game and several of their dominoes are marked too. It's a real shame as this is a great game but the quality of the product is not brilliant."
16822,5205,5," everthing turn out ok we love the game and hope to get many hours of fun from it in the future"
16823,5205,4," A new way to play dominoes- giving children an added interest and a competitive edge with the train whistle a great source of amusement- and scorn to the opposing player!"
16824,5205,3," The dominoes are great as is the metal case but the domino hub has arrived broken& but I don't see the point of sending the whole game back for the hub to be replaced. Please advise."
16825,5205,3," Person it was gift for was quite disappointed  . This was to do with the central station part - she said her friend bought the game for this same price on amazon where the station/gold part was better quality and the train tooted !??!  impressive casing though. Dont think it had instructions in it ? either that or my friend  cheats !!  Shop around is my advice to ensure you are getting what you want as it looks as though there are quite a few versions"
16826,5205,5," A fun game - good for a party especially since a group can play. Hardwearing case for storage"
16827,5205,5," A very good game but better played with 4 or more people. Rules easy to understand and not too many of them. Like the metal case to store the |dominoes| in. Worth the extra money spent on it."
16828,5205,5," Arrived the following day& although the case is slightly dented I still feel that I have had a bargain ready for the winter nights."
16829,5206,3," It's OK& but not proper dominoes :-(It's more of a pair matching game."
16830,5206,5," great game grandson just loved playing with them"
16831,5206,4," Very good"
16832,5206,5," Good"
16833,5207,5," great resource. Many thanks."
16834,5208,5," This is a real favourite in our house. Ideal for making Maths fun& played just the same as Scrabble with four main maths symbols& along with brackets in clear plastic to be placed over the top of existing numbers to make more complex formulae.  Just start with simple 2+3=5 equations& and then head for fully fledged |BODMAS| rules type equations with brackets.  Works well from 5/6 years upwards& and I still enjoy it as an adult.  Highly recommended for having great fun with your child whilst helping maths development!!  Go for it. The only reservation I have on the durability is based on the original version where you need to be careful not to overfold the board& but in all other respects& it should stand up to the normal conditions for this age group."
16835,5208,4," A simple game that can be played on many levels and will 'grow' as maths ability improves. Like scrabble& players have to build equations - can introduce the use of brackets to make more complex sums. My kids love this and so do I"
16836,5208,5," This was bought to help my daughter with her maths and then ended up in the classroom. A good game& tests all your maths knowledge and helps you improve on your weaker areas."
16837,5208,4," Good to help with maths skills.Easy addapted to suit different ages.It would help if there was little seperate bags to keep numbers and things seperate.But that was easily fixed taught my little girls to sew and we made some"
16838,5208,5," This was a present for a talented 5 year old which can be easy to hard. He used it to make sums - plus and subtract - but as he develops his maths knowledge he will use the game at it should be used."
16839,5208,5," Great& easy to understand and set up game. My 6 year old has been struggling with maths and this game has made it fun to learn. Also can be for older children. Would recommend."
16840,5208,5," The person who received this gift& from me& has had endless fun with their parents playing it.There is a full range to educate whislst having fun."
16841,5209,5," We played an old version of this game on holiday with our 7 year old and loved it. I was so pleased to find it. It is now hidden away as a Christmas gift"
16842,5209,5," REALLY PLEASED WITH THIS GAME. CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING NEGATIVE TO SAY. MY GRANDSON AND GRANDDAUGHTER ENJOY PLAYING THIS GAME EVERY TIME THEY COME FOR A VISIT."
16843,5209,4," I bought this for the grandchildren& it looks good although they didn't get chance to play with it over Christmas."
16844,5210,3," We though we were upgrading our older game which also twisted round& but we ended up using the tile holders from the previous game as the ones it comes with do not hold the tiles very well but these don't fit into the little tray under the board. Removing the tiles from the board at the end of a game is awkward and fiddly due to the nobbly sections which keep the tiles in place. However it is much better to see the detail on each of the tiles than our previous brown board with wooden tiles where the letter etc kept fading. We do spend a lot of time playing this game."
16845,5210,1," It looks like high design. Yet it has been designed by someone who obvioulsy does not play scrabble. I play for hours with my Aunt and we bought it thinking it would be a treat. It wasn't. The tile racks are cheap looking and fall over. The board is smaller than the regular size. When the board is full of words it looks ugly. We ended up putting it away and going back to an old tatty one with mismatched parts. The doubles and triples have been unnecessarily changed and are less clear. Older people who want to play with this set might find the tiles and the pins on the board that keep them in place difficult to manipulate.They keep reinventing the wheel with these scrabble boards and they keep failing. Mattel please consult scrabble players before we waste any more money on dark boards& shiny tiles and depressing over priced sets. The original colours of board and tiles are the best. Give us a clear board. This is just awful. I gave it to friends who haven't played scrabble much hopefully they wont realize how awful it is."
16846,5210,2," Tiles do not stay on holders. They keep sliding off spoiling the gameHad to use our old holders from the other game we have"
16847,5210,3," I bought this for my Husband's birthday as we do love to play Scrabble and our old board has seen better days. I was drawn in by the description as it stated it had a high quality wood effect surround& and it swivels& something that our old board did not.When the board arrived I was impressed by the packaging.  The black box seemed quite manly"
16848,5210,1," I was so excited about getting this scrabble board& I got one for myself and one as a present. I foolishly gave the present without opening mine up first. I was disappointed with the quality and the look& I could have brought the standard board for Â£15 and would have got a lot better value for my money and would have been more satisfied.The turn table doesn't turn easilyit is definitely not luxurious scrabble set|It contains a highly-finished wood-effect framed board| no it doesn't it is plastic and looks like plastic it is badly made and lifts away slightly at the corners|All the contents are made to the highest quality| wrong& the tile holders are pathetic and do not even keep the tiles on. The tile holders are badly designed and are definitely not of any quality. the bag to put the letters in is also badly made.Overall very disappointed& wanted to express my views to the seller before posting a review but wasn't able to."
16849,5210,5," An excellent buy.We have a deluxe Scrabble that is over 40years old and we bought this for our granddaughter. It is suberb and will last her all her life we imagine.-Abeautiful board& smooth turntable& very clear tiles.the only slight criticism is that the tile racks do not hold the tiles as securely and at the same angle as our old set does."
16850,5210,2," Although initially wowed on taking it out of the box we soon realised that there was no way of scoring the game . Our previous de luxe version  provided tile tacks&on which you could keep score! Not as |solid| as the one we owned previously Disappointing"
16851,5210,5," bought for a group of elderly residents and they loved the board. No slipped tiles anymore and the turntable allows for proper viewing of the board."
16852,5211,5," I bought this for my 13 year old son& including the extension pack -  which I would also recommend. It can be played alone& with 2 players for a quick 10 minutes play& or with as many players as you wish for as long as you like (we play with 6 players). It is enjoyable& educational& frustrating (depending on the luck of the question by rolling the die!) My 18 year old son has even requested some of the other themes for his birthday!Good value for money& and is a truly fab family game for all ages. Its relatively small and compact size also makes it perfect for journeys and holidays."
16853,5211,3," Does what it says& just another bundle of countries to supplement the original game.  Good for educating about other countires round the world.........................."
16854,5211,5," My daughter loves it. Handy with lots of information to share and learn.Also useful for adults/parents to learn if we have missed something in the school days :)"
16855,5211,2," just a top up of cards for the original box set. only has 20 cards though so i thught it was not good value for money though probably better than other retailers."
16856,5211,5," Beautiful illustrations to engage children (and me!)and really educational"
16857,5212,5," Very good product"
16858,5213,5," I can't believe that there are no reviews for this!Katamino is simply are great game. It's a very quick two player game where visual skills come to the fore. All you are basically doing is creating a square/rectangle from the tetris shaped pieces in front of you. It can also be played solitaire style but I believe it's more fun as a two player game. A simple frantic race against time to be first to complete the geometric puzzle.Definitely for kids and adults."
16859,5213,5," Loved by my 5 yr old who thoroughly enjoys anything that makes him think. My 3 year old just enjoys fitting the blocks together and my husband and myself are still frustrated by not being able to complete it. This has entertained the family either individually or as a group working it out.Only down side is worrying about losing any of the pieces."
16860,5213,5," This is a beautifully made set of puzzle pieces& brightly coloured and attractive as well as very tactile and easy to handle. The book that accompanies the set contains variations for solo play as well as possibilities for games. Any age group can have fun with this product. It is so absorbing and has so much potential. You can use the accompanying frame or simply a desk or table top. The box is sturdy and protects the set perfectly. I use puzzles like this as distraction therapy to help me cope with severe pain& and this set has already kept me suitably distracted for many hours. It is very easy to find more pentomino puzzle ideas online and in other books. This is a superb product that will last a lifetime.  I am beyond delighted."
16861,5213,5," This game is brilliant& I play it with everyone from the little man and my partner to the lads and some drinks!Nice quality design and it can be quite a challenge both timed or in a race against someone else. It comes with a set of picture cards to show you which pieces you can use and color coded for difficulty. You can also divide the board into different sizes which again alters the difficulty. But like all good things there is no right or wrong way to lay the blocks& other than they fit or they do not fit.Great game& good brain work out and a perfect xmas prezzie."
16862,5213,5," Saw a little girl playing with this in a restaurant and she was utterly absorbed. Bought it for my Reception class (ages 5-6) and they loved it too. Teaches logic and patience. Can be used horizontally or vertically as building blocks. Solid wood - would last forever! A great present to extend the thought processes!"
16863,5213,5," Excellent& extremely good quality game. It's challenging for any age group and really entertaining. It's kept our 8 and 5 year olds (playing different difficulty levels) entertained for many a wet afternoon. The game is very well made with solid wooden pieces and board and I would imagine it will last for years. The instruction manual is also of a very high quality card and won't tear easily."
16864,5213,4," Great game.  Well made& brightly painted blocks.  I gave it to my 5 year old niece for Christmas.  It can be played as a game of solitaire& in pairs or used as building blocks to create fun shapes.  My niece enjoyed playing it alone or with an adult and it occupied the adults for hours as they tried to work out how to fit all the pieces into the board."
16865,5213,5," Bought for our six year old who had seen his nine year old friend with one.  This is a long lasting puzzle and looks lovely. As an adult I found it very difficult to pull myself away& I just had to try the next level"
16866,5214,4," This is a great little game.  If you like Euro style games and have young kids it is worth getting.  My 3 year old and 6 year old like to play it and can understand the rules.As usual with Haba Games& the pieces are very well made and high quality.Recommended"
16867,5215,5," because the kids love it and they play for hours on it would recommend to anyone. it is a bit hard in some places"
16868,5215,5," My nephew loves it! Well done game too& not too difficult for a 5 year old!"
16869,5216,5," Excellent"
16870,5217,5," My grandchildren were thrilled with it as the plastic cash supplied with a toy till was very inferior. I did have to trim the notes a little bit to fit but an excellent purchase"
16871,5217,5," Just right as an add on for the Fisher Price till with money to play shops& but it's also very accurate markings etc on the money - good for learning."
16872,5217,5," My little girl loves playing with this set of money&  much safer than her playing with our real stuff!!"
16873,5217,4," ideal as a toy and educational too.  bought for a 4 year old to play shopping and loves them..however I did remove the very small coins for her safety..good service and value"
16874,5218,5," My 8 year old daughter got this for Christmas and it was a big hit.  She enjoyed learning how to stitch and she made a heart for me& so we were both happy!  My only criticism would be that the instructions were a tad vague in parts."
16875,5219,5," We bought this for our 6 year old daughter.  We've done a few of the activities/experiments at a time and it's lasted us ages.  It's got lots of things to make and do - we especially love the pinhole 'camera' (It doesn't take photos& it shows the image on the screen at the back of the 'camera' box).  All the parts are substantial and good quality.  There are some things that you will need& which aren't included in the box - torches& sticky tape&etc. - but it does tell you on the back of the box what you'll need.My daughter loves this so much& she woke us up early today so that we could do some more!  I highly recommend it."
16876,5219,5," My grandaughter is 7years old she loved it!"
16877,5219,5," Really good stuff."
16878,5219,5," good"
16879,5220,4," These puzzles were beautiful and my daughter loved them however there was a piece missing from one of the puzzles which was very disappointing for her. Also take care as the coating on the pieces makes them quite stiff to put together."
16880,5221,5," very clever game my grandchildren are doing math without realising it whoever thought of this is a wizz kid fun for all ages"
16881,5221,4," This is a game that I enjoy playing with my 8 year old. Its a quick game that is a good practice of simple maths& although she will soon find it too easy so will need something more taxing."
16882,5221,5," Great way to learn the simple counting of the dots on a dice as well as learning how to advance maths skills.  it's learning with colour and fun& so it doesn't feel like learning. Both 7"
16883,5221,4," I bought these dice as a present for a training teacher to use in the classroom. I had expected them to be the size of normal dice& but was pleasantly surprised to find they are larger (about an inch cubed). This will save them being lost in the class like their smaller counterparts& and suitable for sharing in groups of three/four. The dice are plastic and durable& of a good weight. In addition there is a handy felt bag to store the dice. I like the fact a dodecahedral dice is included as this can be used to help students learn about different polyhedra and provides another level of extension."
16884,5221,5," bought for my daughter for xmastrying to find new games that were also educationalhaving sighed at the sight of a maths game& when we started playing it rolling the dice and she beat me on the first round& she enjoyed and wanted to play again.a fun way to play with mathswould recommend - daughters age 7"
16885,5221,5," Just right to carry about and play anywhere. Dice have a lovely feel. Choosing your own counter (whatever is to hand) makes the game more personal. Can adapt rules to suit any age& making it easier or harder as required. Most of all children love it (a math fearing 6 year old"
16886,5221,5," This arrived well within the estimated dates& well packaged"
16887,5221,5," My children range from 10 years old to 5 years old and they all enjoy this game. Challenging but not complicated. Great for maths skills and they don't get bored."
16888,5222,5," I am a qualified Primary Teacher and have been teaching children to read for many years. I am also a Mum with young children of my own! I was looking for a reading game to play with my 5 year old at home and I came across Kloo. It is working wonders in boosting my son's enthusiasm for reading and is a lot of fun. I was so impressed with the card game that I decided to write a review from a professional point of view - here it is:)There are 3 fun& early reading games that can be played with a deck of colourful Kloo cards. The cards are high quality& bright and clear - designed to build young children's confidence in reading words and sequencing basic sentences.  Kloo is most appropriate for a teacher or parent to play with children aged 4-7 years.The reading cards are colour-coded& with one word printed on each"
16889,5222,5," My class really enjoyed playing this game.  I've played it with my grand children who really enjoyed winning animals for their zoo and making up sentences.  Even the little one was able to join in with some help from me.Then& being a Literacy Teacher I thought that I could use the cards with some of my own learners (ones I know well and I was confident would like the idea of a game) as a filler to rehearse sentence building skills.  I was able to adapt the game after the first run through so that they thought about grammar and parts of speech and they began building their own sentences with new words that they suggested.  The Kloo Cards proved an excellent jumping off point for all sorts of English Language activities.  They're a regular part of my teaching kit now and the grand children always ask to play when they visit."
16890,5222,5," A superb game.  So far we've mainly used Kloo as a version of the pelmanism card game - lay all the cards face down and pick up two cards& hoping to find a pair.  It stresses the memory (my memory at least) and acts as a fast and fun version of reading flash cards!  I guess the ideal age is for 4& 5 or 6 year old kids although it may be helpful if your child is maybe a bit older but struggles with word recognition (which is our situation).  Lots of fun."
16891,5222,5," My kids loved playing this game! They loved collecting all the animals and swapping them. This encouraged my 5 year old to try to make her sentences as long as possible to win the animal cards. The colour coding is also extremely useful to help children to remember which order to put their words in. After several games she was able to read the words with great ease. A wonderful way to get children to read& highly recommended!!"
16892,5222,5," Getting my son to read was nothing short of challenging at 4yrs old so I wanted to find games to play with my daughter at the same age. A recent trip to London Zoo was preceded with KLOO Zoo reader cards. She loved creating her Zoo sentences in a simple"
16893,5222,5," Having tried other Kloo card packs myself to learn some Spanish - I thought that this would be a good birthday present for my 7 year old nephew. Sometimes it's hard to know what to buy kids in the family without thinking it's a bit throw-away or may be a bad influence in some way! (Soliders! Guns! etc) They're nice and simple to use& and the designs are vibrant which helps to keep your interest.Kloo cards are definitely fun and educational - the perfect mix. Kids tend to love animals so this is a good way to get them to learn without it feeling like hard work. I've been told it's one of the best presents he's had - which makes me extra pleased knowing I'm contributing a little to his future and that he's enjoying himself."
16894,5222,5," Really pleased with this. I teach EFL and have bilingual children growing up in Germany&  in the German state school system who don't learn English at school til age 8. My 7 and 9 year old have enjoyed playing the game in its sentence making form and as snap& my 4 and 7 year old enjoy the memory version even though the 4 year old is only just learning to read and my 9 year old has played the sentence making version of Kloo Zoo with her German native speaker friends who have only been learning English for a year.So far everyone has enjoyed the game and played it in preference to other options. It seems to work well on different levels - as reading practice for younger native speakers who do their schooling in another language and for non native speaker s who have been learning English for a fairly short time.Unlike the more complex Race to London there have not been any issues with the Kloo arrow system producing sentences that are not actually correct/ don't quite make sense& so a 5 star review. I would recommend this game."
16895,5223,5," Alpha Animals has two levels of play.  We find the easy level as good as any other.  Very enjoyable for children"
16896,5223,5," My 5 yr old son loves this game& gets everyone thinking! The concept is very transferable so instead of animals you can change the subject."
16897,5223,5," this was the perfect present for my animal mad 10 year old boythis generated discussion& increased knowledge and fun"
16898,5223,5," very good"
16899,5223,5," I play this game with my 2 year old son. He knows his alphabet and loves animals. Perfect game for him and the whole family."
16900,5224,5," Super for rainy days bought 2 for Christmas present"
16901,5224,3," Bought as present so cannot comment"
16902,5225,4," Bought as Christmas gift"
16903,5225,5," Fab gift for children"
16904,5225,5," Educational and fun"
16905,5226,1," I usually love orchard games. I have several and they are great fun. But very disappointed with this one. The title implies it helps with telling the time but it doesn't. In schools time is taught via the quarter and half hour and most importantly o'clock. This game however refers to 7.00am or 8.30pm which is completely different. It's also possible to play the game without any reference to telling the time by just matching the picture on the card to the picture on the board so children don't have to tell the time at all and it becomes just a normal lotto game. It would be lovely to see a game which actually deals with telling the time in a way that children would learn. My bright five year old played this with me and is none the wiser about telling the time"
16906,5226,5," This game is fun for learning to tell the time. Each player has a lotto type board with funny time related activities to collect. Quite simple to play and because there are pictures you don't have to be able to tell the time to play it."
16907,5226,3," I just don't think that this is the best tool for trying to teach a child the time.  It is more about understanding the order of the day.  Personally& I didn't really find this useful at all but I would undertand if others did!"
16908,5226,1," Really just a lotto game. Does not teach telling the time. Very disappointing. Expected more from this company. Extremely poor."
16909,5226,5," Great Christmas present for Pre-school children.  I got lots of great feedback for buying this gift.  Fun but educational"
16910,5226,4," I asked someone to buy this for my Son for Christmas because he is in Year 1 (5 1/2) and working on telling the time at school.  Like most of the other Orchard games& the premise is pretty simple - pick up a card& say the time on it and then whoever has that time (and picture) on their individual board shouts out 'Time!' until someone completes their entire board.  Each card has a picture of an activity e.g. lunctime& bedtime and has the time in both digital and analogue.  The fact that there are pictures means that my son can play at his level& telling the time on the analogue clocks but my 2 and a bit year old daughter can also join in using the pictures to match cards to her board instead.This isn't the most exciting game for the children but it does help a bit with telling the time and is more fun than just drawing loads of clocks and getting your child to fill in the times (which is what his homework consists of!).  Not sure how long I'll persuade him to read the times out for rather than memorising the pictures though..."
16911,5226,5," Tell the Timegreat item - just what I wanted for my granddaughter who is nearly six years old - should help tell the time"
16912,5226,3," Its quick and easy to pick up& but I wouldn't say it helps that much with telling the time.  A nice family game if you have a spare 15 minutes though."
16913,5227,5," highly recommend this game  -it was very funny and competative when male versus female -good for all ages - good party game"
16914,5227,5," Great fun game"
16915,5228,4," Everythong OK& even if it was not delivered very soon"
16916,5229,3," This toy should work& in fact it probably would work if the materials weren't so horribly cheap and actually did what they were supposed to do.  That said& 6 year old granddaughter really enjoyed it but& because of the useless materials& only had about 10 minutes play.  Not only was the glitter and glue and whatever difficult& near impossible in one case& to get out but there isn't enough of it to cover decorate the butterflies supplied.  I would neither recommend it nor buy it again."
16917,5229,5," An excellent item for 'busy' kids who love to make pretty things. This was very well received by my 6 year-old niece& not least for the dazzling array of pretty colours. Also by her mum& who could see it was safe to play with. It's exactly as described by the manufacturing company& who seem to have put a lot of thought into their products& which seem to me to be as affordable as they are desirable."
16918,5229,5," Easy to make& with clear instructions. The butterflies look lovely when complete and make a great addition to a little girl's bedroom& we have hung them on the wall and they look very effective."
16919,5229,4," My 4 year old  and 2 year old both enjoyed painting and gluing the butterflies. Only downside was that the butterflies on the hair slides got stuck in their hair! Ut good for a rainy day"
16920,5229,4," grandaughter was delighted with this product as she loves making things she has already made the butterflies and has them hangingfrom her ceiling"
16921,5230,5," My little boy is17 months old absolutely adores the Gruffalo& although he is a little young to play the game properly he loves finding the cards I ask for and pair them up.He likes playing with flash/snap cards but unfortunately screws them up and makes them rather tatty after only a few games& however The cards are made of a robust cardboard and have so far withstood quite a bit of rough play/sucking and chewing.I would highly recommend these."
16922,5230,5," Perfect for my 2 year old nephew. Perfect size for his little things to take to nursery or on a day out"
16923,5230,5," I saw a variety of memory card games at my toddler's nursery and thought about investing in one myself. My little girl loves all things related to the Gruffalo so this was the ideal game.It is the perfect size& good quality and at a very good price. The cards are small but brightly printed& there is a little instructions manual that accompanies the game and all the cards fit nicely into their little box for easy storage or carrying around.Even though my little one cannot play by the rules yet& she loves to pick up the little cards in her hands and match pairs.The size of the cards is perfect for little hands and robust enough for 2+ year olds.I'm surprised there are no other reviews for this product but I suspect that is because it is a fairly recent listing. The cards had a 2014 copyright printed on them.Very pleased with my purchase and look forward to many more memory games with my little one."
16924,5230,5," For Gruffalo fans of all ages! The pictures on the card are clear& cards are sturdy and easy for a young toddler to handle at 4inches x4 inches. A good game for children to improve their memory and learn about matching pairs& taking turns in the game& and counting the pairs at the end of the game to determine the winner. They learn to be a bit competitive too! The illustrations are engaging and children can easily identify and associate them with the illustrations in their favourite story book. Recommended for 2.5 years up! Don't think twice& buy it!"
16925,5230,4," My 2-year-old loves this game& even if she hasn't quite got the hang of taking turns to make matches she loves the illustrations and recognises them from the Gruffalo books.The cards are thick cardboard with a glossy picture on one side. They're not super high quality& but then perhaps you wouldn't expect it for the price (the back of the cards is brown rather than white for example and the corners aren't rounded). The box is strong and a nice small size (hate oversized boxes which you have to find a place for!)."
16926,5230,5," Awesome game fab quality and excellent illustrations!  My son is loving matching games at the minute and that makes it more exciting that it's characters he loves!"
16927,5230,5," The cards are an excellent size and the pictures clear. I played this with my 5 and 3 year old grandchildren â€¦ and loved it. My grandson was able to clearly tell which were the matching pairs because the pictures are such good quality and authentic.A traditional game which can be thoroughly enjoyed by a new generation because of the picture links to such favourite characters."
16928,5230,5," Brought this for.My nephew along with finger puppets and he loves the game. Keeps the kids occupied and learning at same time"
16929,5231,4," These cards consist of two types of card - one half with drawings of various coins on"
16930,5231,5," i have twin girls aged six& they are learning money in school very good to help them out"
16931,5231,5," Played this with my 7 year old Grandson who engaged and improved his money knowledge and skills.We started off with pairing/matching though as there are a lot of cards showing different amounts of money in mixed words& coins etc I think this needs to be done before attempting the Snap game to ensure child becomes familiar with amounts and fully understands concept.Very educational yet fun. Would recommended it for 6+ year olds."
16932,5231,5," Bought for a friends child.  We already have the game(a gift) and I think its great.  There are so many more games you can play besides snap and pairs.  We play GO fish and use them as flash cards& so they resite whats on the card and/or immediately tell you what is the cards value.  We also own the time cards...... not 4 of all& so GO fish will need to be tailored."
16933,5231,5," I am buying another packet as to have more possiblities to win snap! Very quick delivery (4 days)& nice plasticy cards& great quality& very pleased."
16934,5231,5," A great little pack to help children learn about money. There are two games but I have adapted them to suit different childrens needs.Very pleased and the children loved the games."
16935,5231,4," A perfect tool for re-inforcing coin identification.  It is easy to carry around and has provided extensive periods of fun and learning. Reasonably priced and delivered promptly."
16936,5231,5," Very versatile cards. Can play matching of coins to amount or same amounts with different coins. I play matching game with just a few at a time rather than snap. Most useful."
16937,5232,5," Bought this for my nephew aged 8. Really liked the idea of the fishing (as he already plays fishing on the Nintendo Wii!!) and also really helps with spelling. Little brother aged 5 also enjoyed playing. It can be a bit slow paced but with the competition to get the word first it helps. It would be better if it had more fishing rods and scoreboards for other players though."
16938,5232,5," As an EFL teacher I have found this game an excellent way to consolidate the alphabet as it was being learnt. It can then be used to test spelling or introduce new words. Even the kids who aren't keen on learning can't resist playing this game.Undoubtedly would be great fun also for children growing up in an all-English environment&too.A very worthwhile buy."
16939,5232,3,""
16940,5232,5," When I received this Fish N Spell Game I was really impressed with the quality of this product& the only downside are the small cardboard cards where you put the letters on& looks on the thin side& could of done with being laminated really& but apart from that I would definitely recommend it to anyone& my 5 year old little boy loves playing with it!"
16941,5233,4," I would have liked to have had a container for this product once it was unwrapped& as there are lots of bits to lose.... and you know hwat children are like! However& the fractions are easy to see and it is a good product to use for teaching equivalence."
16942,5233,5," Nice visual aid for a grandchild who was having trouble with fractions.  Colourful and attractive which adds to the appeal"
16943,5234,5," Can't wait to play this with my 4yr old granddaughter - roll on Xmas day"
16944,5234,4," looks like good family game bought as a gift"
16945,5234,5," Excellent gift great price"
16946,5234,5," Nice stocking filler"
16947,5235,5," An interesting and educational game that never gets boring.  Quality cards that are a pleasure to use.  I have bought all the continental sets and use them at home as well as giving them as presents.  Almost everyone will improve their knowledge of UK geography through using this version of Mapominoes.  Make sure you play on a big table!"
16948,5235,5," I was dubious about this game when my Mum rang and said |Get Mapominoes for Christmas. Just played it and it's great|. How fun can dominos really be? But yep& she was right and late Christmas Day saw 5 of us (wife's side of family) playing and enjoying the game.No need to be a geography nerd but you'll soon start getting excited about areas of the United Kingdom you know well and can potentially play next round."
16949,5235,5," Brilliant. Lots of Christmas day fun for the competitive family. We had a great time& Wales finished up under the settee& Scotland was going out of the door. The family were very enthusiastic. We had Europe last year which was a smaller pack of cards& the family would like the other packs but we would need a large hall to complete the world.  They would also like USA states pack to be produced."
16950,5235,3," Got this to while away hours and increase youngsters knowledge of UK geography. However& the rules are somewhat difficult to understand and have only used it once as a result."
16951,5235,5," A very informative and helpful game. Nicely constructed and easy to use. This is my second purchase of one of these games and I will buy more."
16952,5235,5," We have all the mapominoes set and thoroughly enjoy playing with them all either individually or mixing a couple of packs& though you need a lot of floor space for that!  Glad they have brought out the UK version& we had discussions about that last year. Wonder what could be next...."
16953,5235,5," A great game that combines fun with learning - a great favourite with my grandchildren and they now know more about the geography of the UK than me - very satisfied."
16954,5235,4," Educational game requiring a reasonable sized table to play! Can play individual countries on their own to reduce the length of play."
16955,5236,5," I bought this toy Xmas 2007 for my 12 year old daughter and we have already had our money's worth and its only January 2008!! We all love it.  It is much better than Scrabble as it is quicker and everyone is playing all of the time rather than spending time waiting for your turn.  As you pick up extra tiles you can constantly change the crossword that you have made.  The standard of the words made by the children has improved dramatically over the Christmas period and they are having so much fun that they don't even realise that they are learning.  It will be going on holiday with us too as it is so easy to pack.  Buy this toy!!"
16956,5236,5," This is a clever toy very like scrabble but played by yourself. Tiles are shared between players and each player then makes their own crossword changing tiles when they can't get out. The crossword changes all the time as more tiles are picked up and placed into words. There is no need for a board or holders for the tiles and the game is easily transported. An excellent but simple concept."
16957,5236,5," The best fun we have had in years.  Simple instructions.  Great family game.  Words can be as long or as short as you want.  Children enjoy playing. We played in three teams of two as a variation of the game and it worked well."
16958,5236,5," This game is one of the best we have ever played.We like the adaptability for player numbers& it's very compact and easy to play anywhere and take anywhere& it's very good for young and old and easy to play with all age ranges. We are hooked."
16959,5236,5," A brilliant game. Better than Scrabble as everyone plays at the same time&so no lenghty wait for your go.Great that 8 people can play at the same time but it's also a good game to play on your own. Good for all ages to play together."
16960,5236,1," This is the second Banagrams game that I've bought from Amazon. The first was great& it's a really fun game& lovely quality& lots of fun had over Christmas. I bought the second as a gift& but it arrived in an outer bag that was too small for the banana and stapled together.  The yellow banana bag didn't have the 'registered' R mark by the logo& and made of inferior material.  The tiles have hollow backs and are very poor quality (where genuine bananagram tiles are solid and smooth).  I reported this all to Amazon& sent them photos of the two products side by side& but they don't care& and their internal investigation process have deemed it to be 'genuine'.  Shame on you Amazon.  Buy this great game somewhere else."
16961,5236,1," Misleading company name& Baby House UK& but it comes from China!!  This version of Bananagrams has very poor quality tiles& a few even with broken edges. Have purchased this from another seller and been pleased with quality."
16962,5236,1," Took ages to arrive and when it did  the quality was poor. Rough edges to some of the tiles and poor letter printing on them. Didn't think you could go far wrong with something with so few components. Wish I had spring go more on a better produced version."
16963,5237,3," I got this for my friends little girl who is 3& I can't say that it's her favourite& but we have played it a few times and she does seem to enjoy it& but tends to get a bit fed up half way through& it's not overly exciting. It's well made and the instructions are quite clear and a game takes about 10 mins. (probably less if the child doesn't need help to play) I think maybe for slightly older kids they might enjoy it a bit more. But there really isn't much too it and you need quite a bit of space to play it."
16964,5237,3," repetative and 5yr old son found it too easy to play"
16965,5237,5," Good for learning your child about numbers& although my 4 year old gets bored easily after 5 minutes."
16966,5237,5," Great learning number game for infant school chdren"
16967,5237,5," Fab easy to understand game& my 3yo loves it"
16968,5237,5," Grandson absolutely loved it"
16969,5237,5," My grandson loves this."
16970,5237,5," Fab little game"
16971,5238,4," Rummikub is my favourite game and my family have played it since I was a child& especially when away from home& camping& caravanning& boating or just holidays in general. These days I spend more time on my PC and phone than I do anywhere else& but still like to have a physical game I can play to get away from it all. My husband likes this game because he's a big fan of numbers& and I enjoy the fast thinking strategy that you have to employ (if you prefer a slower paced game& you don't have to add a timer.) I would definitely say it's a game suitable for all the family& since I've been playing variations of it since I was a kid - but adults should enjoy it just as well.Rummikub Xpress is a little different to traditional Rummikub& and a faster paced game in my opinion& so ideal for short bursts& or having multiple rounds& which gives people a chance to get back in the game if they get unlucky in one round. Instead of tiles you have dice& and you roll the dice to see your numbers for that round& and then have to score the highest points that you can using what's on the table. It's still close enough to the original game of Rummikub to feel familiar& but different enough to make it worth packing in our travel bags. Excellent size to travel with too& and can be played even if you don't have much of a table or space to play it on.We modify it a little bit& having more rolls& more rounds& and adding faster timers for each round& and I think this works better than the official rules of play. If you want to add a frantic pace to it& set your own timer for each round and knock 30 seconds off as the game progresses until you're down to zero - really get the pressure going! 4 stars as a base set& but I definitely think the official rules could use a bit of jazzing up - so alter them as suits your playstyle."
16972,5239,5," A fun way of learning.  And because of the luck factor involved& the parents don't always win the game which for my kids is great.It is a quirky game& learning all the time& getting quicker and better& and sharper with their maths.  What more could you want!  His 8 year old sister got the next stage up and she is now nearly fluent with her tables - happy days.  The have played with both dices together (pink and blue) and definitely it is a win win game - They are learning without even knowing they are learning - brilliant game."
16973,5239,5," The beauty of this game is there's no limits& you can tailor the game to suit your time limit.  It's a great way to encourage children to add& subtract& multiply and keep score of their own numbers.  This game can be fun too& roll two aaahhh!s consecutively and that's no point's. You can emphasise the aaahhh! in so many different tones that you can keep the kids laughing for ages& and it soon becomes known as the aaahhh! game.  Learning games where kids don't realise they are learning& I love them.  Love this game too& simple and yet so effective.  Fun for all ages."
16974,5239,4," Unbelievably& my son loves this game. He has asked to play it most days since he opened it for his birthday (aged 6).Very pleased with this purchase."
16975,5239,5," Fun game that is so easy to learn how to play. Kids got very competitive and they were learning maths without thinking about it."
16976,5239,4," My son has leaning difficulties and struggles with maths but he is happy to play this game and anything that allows him to work with numbers without getting too frustrated is a good thing. The actual dice and little dude's are very sturdy and a perfect size for smaller hands. Good fun."
16977,5239,5," Great game& Highly portable& so can play anywhere. Excellent fun and improves math skills without the children realising they are learning."
16978,5239,5," a clever little game. learning the mental arithmetic without them realising it. a quick game which you can just play over and over again . small portable definitely one to take on our hols. we are going to buy the next level up as well so we have all the tables up to 12."
16979,5239,2," Item as described& kind of& but the game is way too simplistic for the price.  You can do the same with three dice and three coins.  Very disappointing."
16980,5240,5," This is an amazing toy& good quality and really fun. Much better than I thought it would be. It takes 6 aaa batteries but is well worth it!"
16981,5240,5," As a Whovian family what more could you want from a toy. It talks& walks and you shoot it till it's limbs fall of and finally it fallls over. The gun is a little loud and may drive you slightly mad after a while. Just pour yourself a glass of wine and watch the kids dismember the cyberman. It keeps my boys quiet for ages. Happy kids make for a happy if slightly mad parent!"
16982,5240,4," My 6 year old and 3 year old love this. It does need to state clearly that you need to press the button on the gun to start it."
16983,5240,5," I bought 4 of these& they all loved it except the 8 year old& he didn't say as much but possibly a bit young for him"
16984,5241,5," This game lasts as long as you want it to. It is taking the USA by storm. It is fun and frustrating! Involves skill and luck. The main Mexican train game can even be played on computer if you register online and pay a fee.  suits all ages from about 7 up& though my 5 year thoroughly enjoyed it& she needed some help.  Would recommend it to anyone with either a big enough table to fit the dominoes on & or a big enough floor space and no one with arthritus! Fabulous family game"
16985,5241,5," We discovered this game whilst staying with friends in the USA over Thanksgiving.  Since then we have introduced it to friends at home with amazing results.  People who do not normally like to play games absolutely love it& they love the feel and the sound of the tiles and they love the fact that all the age groups can have fun together."
16986,5241,5," Not your traditional Dominos. There are lots of games you can play. Mexican train seems to be the best for our family. Its competitive and fun and it requires thought and some strategy but easy for the kids to master. Then you have to add up all the points at the end.We keep the tally of points in a book and take it in turns to update it.Genuine excitement when we all sit down to play."
16987,5241,3," I love this game and recommend it very highly. You and up to 7 friends can play a variety of games with this domino set and it requires some amount of strategy and thought - but is still just a lot of fun.The down side for this product is that the dots began to fall out of the dimples from the very first time we played - I was very disappointed with this as it was a gift to a friend."
16988,5241,3," Unfortunately I am somewhat disappointed with the quality of these dominoes. I did a bit of research and decided to buy this double 12 set based on the largely positive previous reviews and predominantly intended to use them to play Mexican train (hence the accessories). Everything was present (inc. the plastic station hub and 4 train markers) and the dominoes were complete and shrink-wrapped. However& a couple of dominoes have chips / damage to the back and quite a number appear to be of a slightly different colour (more ivory rather than off-white). A couple are also slightly thicker / thinner than the majority and a few have slightly poor paint spots (although this is just cosmetic). At the end of the day& I did not expect perfect tournament quality dominoes& so I can live with imperfections on the faces& but I am not happy about the ability to potentially identify dominoes due to the damage& colour& marks or size discrepancies. I'll be contacting the supplier for a refund."
16989,5241,5," This is a great game for all ages and up to ten people can play. The Grandchildren enjoy playing and I also play with a group of pensioners at a community centre. it is a game that can bring friends together and at somewhere like a community centre a way of making new friends."
16990,5241,5," We were introduced to the game in the USA where I'm told it is popular. We brought one back and have played it with friends and relatives who have all gone on to buy it for themselves and for other friends and relatives. That says it all& really."
16991,5241,5," I can quite categorically say that this was a great purchase..suitable for all ages& and from two to eight people can have a great time.There are not to many rules to confuse...and it is far superior to straight dominoes."
16992,5242,5," excellent product"
16993,5243,5," Grandson really liked this game and helped with learning the spellings he had been set."
16994,5244,5," How it works:The Pallino is low-tech and works via mechanics to allow you to make mosaic designs out of coloured balls. The balls are enclosed under the see-through plastic cover. To begin& you tilt the Pallino to tip the balls from the reservoir& up to the top where balls can be channeled& one by one& through the mechanism. Using two hands& you hold down a button that corresponds to the collum you want to drop the ball into& as you give the 'enter' button a good tap& which shoots a ball along the channel and into that collum. Balls of colours that aren't wanted can be exited back into the reservoir. The Pallino has fold out props so that it can make use of gravity. The collums can be emptied one at a time& using a 'reset' switch& so when you make a mistake& you don't have to start completely from scratch. There are double-sided picture cards to follow or you can make up your own pictures or designs.Who would enjoy it:This toy takes some patience to make a picture but it is tactile and engaging in its simplicity. When you begin a picture& it's almost impulsive to continue until it's finished. The Pallino is not a flashy 'cool' toy& but it has real child appeal and is likely to be returned to again and again because new creative ideas can be made. It also makes an excellent travel toy. The Pallino would suit any child and some adults& especially those with autistic spectrum disorders who may enjoy the sorting& systems and repetition involved& as well as the colourful visual aspect.What to be aware of:The Pallino toy relies on physics so don't expect perfection in smooth useage as though it was software. For example& sometimes a few balls escape through the 'exit' channel& back into the reservoir when you only wanted one ball to pass through.Read more â€º"
16995,5244,4," 8 year old loves it& at first was a bit difficult to understand how to work it& soon got the hang of it& the exit button releases far too many balls in 1 go& when u just want 1 to exit."
16996,5244,5," brought this as a gift for a family& everyone loves it and plays with it& from the 4-year-old till the 18-year-old...can keep a child busy for him/herself for hours!"
16997,5245,5," i brought this for my 2 year old niece& it was great fun building towers with& but she is a little too young to do the puzzle& but obviously she will grow to learn. Educationally& it's great for shapes& sizes& colors and problem solving& one minor confusion is the colors of one set. one set is red and orange& whilst the others are two shades of the same color.  The other comment to make is& that there is no box or storage for the puzzle& so unless you've got a shelve to put it on& your probably loose all the pieces in a toy box."
16998,5245,1," Poor quality. Felt like balsa wood or papier mache. The pieces were distorted and unevenly shaped and some of them could not fit into the holes so the puzzle was not fit for purpose and could not be used. Many pieces had rough splinters sticking out all over. Shocking quality and had to be returned."
16999,5245,3," a good idea - although the quality of woodwork is not great - quite rough and unpleasant to the touch"
17000,5245,4," This puzzle is brimming with colourful& three-dimensional gorgeousness! Each shape is a different size"
17001,5245,4," Some of the finish on this isn't as good as I expected - little bits of glue showing. But that aside the toy is as i expected - great for helping little ones to recognise colour& shape& size and order.I don't often buy new toys (NCT sales&charity shops& and boot sales all the way)and spent a little more on this than I would have liked& also I had not seen one like this before& - as it was for christmas - and overall im happy with it :))"
17002,5245,5," I love that my son sits and thinks about each move he makes with this toy. You can see him problem solving in his head!"
17003,5245,5," More advanced than others and nice for teaching colours too. 2 and a half to 3 year olds will love it"
17004,5245,4," I bought this for my 14 months old. She loves it. However rather than using this as intended& she likes to stack the blocks on top of each other. Then she topples them over and repeat all over again& she will be at this for a long time& concentrating really hard. I am sure eventually she will use this like it should but she is having fun."
17005,5246,1," Bananagrams is such a good idea for a game but the scoring and the end to need sorting out& based on this& you might expect Appletters to be as good.  Sadly it isn't.  The packaging is brilliant& the actual letters are superbly made.  The game itself is pants.  The idea is that any word placed must be started or ended by the letter at either end of the word chain visible.  This is a rather tedious and dull affair& no sparkle& no laughs and not really much of a brain challenge.  What a let down& buy bananagrams instead but don't go near this one."
17006,5246,5," Excellent - great fun and great learning for all. Highly recommended and very good value for money. Everyone should have one!!"
17007,5246,3," We bought this game because we really liked Bananagrams.  However& the game play is much longer - more like a game of scrabble than the fast pace of Bananagrams."
17008,5246,5," Great game&easy to play and enjoyable for mixed ages. Played at a friends and just had to have one.Appletters Game"
17009,5246,4," I bought this for my daughters stocking at Christmas& it is a bit like scrabble without the board& it's good for spelling and helps her concentrate! Recommended!"
17010,5246,1," Having bought and played Bananagrams& my hopes were high.  This game doesn't match up in any department other than build quality.  A dull game& slow and poorly thought through& even the variations didn't do anything exciting.  If you bought this& play bananagrams with it."
17011,5246,4," Bought this game to play with my Californian friends.  We all enjoyed it& although there were some arguments over words they wanted to spell the American way!"
17012,5246,5," Great game to play as a family& outstanding quality! Also will be great to use with children with letter recognition and to practice spelling words!"
17013,5247,5," This game is effective to the extent that the rules are simple and require no setting up. It is also educational& which exercises the memory part of the brain& keeping it active. The price may be a bit too much for anyone's liking& but I reckon it's worth it based on the fact that it keeps your brain going.Overall a great buy."
17014,5247,5," Compliments the single digets game (recommend as a first buy) may seem a little expensive but the learning value is 10 fold if you have a child who is bright"
17015,5247,5," very well packed brand new  promptly delivered set fo cards& well made and bright arranged in 3 different levels and vyer easy to play as a game."
17016,5247,5," Great game for enthusiastic mathematicians. Some are quite tricky. I use them in class"
17017,5247,5," great"
17018,5248,3," This is a shopping game that encourages counting& turn taking and observational skills.  Each player (up to 4) gets a different shopping list consisting of 5 items& and by throwing the dice and moving around the board you can pick up the matching items if you land on the relevant squares.  The first to complete the shopping list is the winner.My kids quite like playing with this& they enjoy rolling the die and counting the squares to move.  They also like it when they can pick up the items on their list.What they don't like (and this happens a lot) is moving around the board again and again because they fail to get to the necessary square to pick up the one or two items remaining on their list.  Quite often all the players are stuck in a merry-go-round& going round and round the board because no one can hit the needed square to pick up the last item on the list.  There are two of each type of square (two grocery squares& two dairy squares& etc.) but this doesn't help as the item is only located at one of them& so if you're after milk and you land on the other dairy square then tough.If you're lucky you can finish the game quite quickly and everyone is happy& but if you're not able to land on the correct squares then the game develops into such tedium that your kids will get bored or angry.  That's why I only let them play this game occasionally."
17019,5248,5," I recently bought this to keep at my house for my 3 year old grandaughter - her sisters aged 5 and 8 have played the game with her and have all enjoyed being able to play together. The eldest read and explained the rules to the younger two and both helped the youngest to count as she moved her shopper. They all took turns playing shopkeepers& finding the correct cards. It doesn't take too long to play as only 5 items need to be bought for a player to win the game. An excellent first game for a young child."
17020,5248,4," A great way to introduce small children to board games.  It doesn't take too long to complete the game but there are lots of ways to extend it and talk about numbers and real-life tasks.  Some educational value without it being overtly learning based."
17021,5248,5," Bought this to keep at my house for when my grandchildren come round ( at present 4 years and 6 years of age). Was a good game to play and even the four year old soon picked it up. Would recommend this game to anyone with small children!"
17022,5248,3," I got this game for an office secret santa so I really don't know much about the functionality of the product."
17023,5249,4," Would be great to come with pen."
17024,5250,5," I had the Mexican Train dominoes bought for me as a 65th Birthday from my friend who now lives in the U.S.A.  We had been on Holiday together in Spain in Feb 2010 and the weather wasn't too brilliant so& we played it a lot.  I bought the hub as it makes train noises and is fun when playing with grandchildren."
17025,5250,5," we love playing with six and twelve spot dominoes but the 'Mexican train' hub makes it that much more fun"
17026,5250,4," The train station adds a certain |je ne sais quoi| to playing Mexican trains (perhaps I should have said |no se que|!).  The sound will delight children& but can be a little irritating for adults as there is no volume control or short version.  The central section accomodates the starting double domino& which is then pressed to deliver the sound.  Unfortunately on ours& this cavity was a tiny bit too small for several of our dominoes& so they became stuck.  A craft knife and a few minutes is all it took to shave off some of the edge of the cavity to solve the problem.All in all& very well worth the Â£6 paid.  One star lost for need to modify cavity."
17027,5250,5," We bought this game because one of our friends invited us to join the game. It was very funny& exciting and a veyr good social thing. I will recommend anyone to buy it. This game is more interesting when 6 people play it. Highly recommended."
17028,5251,5," This is a simple game for young children. There are 4 shopping lists& 4 shopping trolleys and 32 item cards with pictures of foodstuffs and other things that you can buy in the supermarket. Each player takes a shopping list and a trolley& and all the item cards are placed faced down. Players then take turns to pick cards and try to find the ones which match the pictures on their shopping list. The aim is to fill your trolley with the items on your list before anyone else gets all their things.This is a fun memory game for even the youngest children. My two-and-a-half year old is addicted! She wants 'the shopping game' first thing in the morning and last thing at night. The great thing is that I can sit down with both her and my five year old and we can do something together that they both like. I have also been known to set them up playing with each other and then creep away and do something by myself for 15 minutes...!"
17029,5251,4," My children have loved the shopping game ever since they were old enough to understand the concept - about 2.5. There are other games out there that perform a similar function - having to remember where a face-down card is and having to find all the cards on your list - but this is the best version I've found. Shopping is something that all children know about and mine certainly found it fun to play at such a familiar activity. At the end of the game they enjoy taking their |full trolly| to an imaginary check out and paying for their shopping. I would highly recommend this game..."
17030,5251,5," My daughter had her first Orchard Toys game (Funny People) for her 2nd birthday a recently and the friend recommended the Orchard range to me.  In the box was the Catalogue and I noticed that the best seller is this Shopping List game& so I bought it for her a month ago (she is 2 yrs& 1 month now) and she has taken to the game like a duck to water - is absolutely hooked on it in fact.  She's bright and pretty advanced in her speaking abilities so is able to both recognise and say all the 32 shopping items (CD& socks& aubergine& sweeties& milk& washing powder& etc.)  But it also teaches memory skills& and patience.  When it is your turn& you choose a face-down item& and see if it is on your list& and if it is& you put it in your trolley& if not you replace it& face down... then the next player& etc. until the first person fills their 8-slot trolley - they're the winner.  At the same time as buying this& I bought the additional 2 list/2 trolley/16 more shopping items booster set& which means 6 players can play& but if like us& there are only a few of you& it isn't really necessary& unless you want the variety of shopping items. I was even more pleasantly surprised& within week 1 to lose a piece of the game& rang Orchard to ask if they sell spares& and was well impressed to find they offered to send me one& for free& which arrived 2 days later.  Well done Orchard - colourful fun games& small enough to take travelling& at sensible prices& and with first class customer care.  I will definitely buy more games& in fact have just re-bought the shopping list game for another 2 year old's birthday present."
17031,5251,5," I use this game a lot in therapy sessions. It's great for learning vocabulary& practicing speech sounds& turn-taking& listening and attention&concentration& etc. etc. Best of all& the children really enjoy playing it and it shows that 'low-tech' games are still very popular."
17032,5251,5," My daughter's not much over 2 but we are already enjoying this game because the theme is something she can strongly relate to& and it is easy to alter the rules to make it playable by children who don't yet have the patience for memory games.  At the moment all the shopping tiles are in a little cloth bag (anything non-see-through would do& but I had cloth bags handy) and we take turns to draw a tile& then compare it with both shopping lists to see if either of us wants it& and put it aside if we don't.  When she's ready I'll move on to putting it back in the bag if the drawer doesn't want it for herself& and after that try laying them out as in the full game but leaving tiles we don't want face up.  Unless of course she makes a big leap forward :)"
17033,5251,4," A nice simple game to play with your little ones& that's not too bad for you.  The basic idea is a memory game& as you take it in turns to try"
17034,5252,1," My daughter had bought the appropriate VTech InnoTab Max the previous week for her son's birthday& I bought the Toy Story software to go with it& which had a sticker on it stating it worked with the InnoTab Max. However when we tried it on his birthday& a message came up on the screen saying the software wasn't compatible& despite it saying on the packaging that it worked with ALL the VTech InnoTab. I discovered that the hardware had to be updated& and therefore had to download the update before the Toy Story software could be used. (I found this info purely by chance on another review site) I considered the information on the game misleading& saying it would work with ALL InnoTab - and it didn't&  and my grandson was hugely disappointed."
17035,5252,1," First thing i ordered this on Thursday and was advertised as 'Prime' delivery&it did not arrive until the following WEDNESDAY.Then when it did eventually arrive&put it in my sons Innotab and it said |the cartridge was not compatible| !!! Even though the box states |Compatible with ALL Innotab systems.Pfft waste of money and time.The game may be great but didn't get chance to see."
17036,5252,4," My four year old soon had the games mastered which was a little disappointing as I hoped they would be more challenging. There are some math and letter puzzles to solve which are ideal for his age and a little older. It has good graphics and easy to use& overall it is quite satisfactory."
17037,5252,5," Brilliant game very educational and keeps my 3 year old daughter entertained & would highly recommend for any child who loves Woody and Buzz"
17038,5252,4," brought as present for son's innotab max& he like toy story& he is familiar with the characters and the learning idea incorporated into a game i thought would aid his learning& only time will tell& but he seems to be picking the ideals behind the game quite well."
17039,5252,5," This was a christmas present for my boys and they absolutley love it. The game has keeps them entertained for hours and the games are educational which is fantastic"
17040,5252,5," Great game with variety which include storytelling& missing letter's and description of words. Hours of fun at a good price."
17041,5252,4," Arrived in good time. I was pleased as it was a gift for my granddaughter so not for my own use."
17042,5253,5," Can easily spend hours trying to crack this ... Great gift idea"
17043,5254,5," This is a lovely well made thing. Our daughter loved it from an early age and we bought another for a friend's baby. The shapes& colours& and numbers make it very interesting for little people. The monkey on the first page looks a bit like Gordon Brown."
17044,5255,5," The game of Mexican trains is addictive& but also has many rule variations& so make sure all players agree on the rules beforehand - failure in this area can lead to tears!  The rules included in this set are open to interpretation& but this is not important as long you agree what they are to be.This particular set of double-twelve dominoes is well made with clear coloured dots& although some of the colours are similar (inevitable with twelve colours).  The dominoes have a nice feel to them and enough weight to be stable when standing up (you don't want your dominoes falling over for all to see).  There was no smearing of the dot colouring and no marks on the underside (as reported in another review).Be prepared for the tin box (incidentally it is decorated differently to that shown on the web page) to be damaged& as the packaging it was sent in was woefully inadequate.  I spent half an hour in the shed gently teasing the |bruised| corners back into a good enough shape for the lid to fit acceptably well.  This was a pity as the box is attractive.All in all& worth the Â£9 paid and would recommend it to all.PS have just spent a week in France staying with French friends and had to leave the game behind!  Another is on order.PPS Sep 12 - the design shown now (red with two dominoes) is the one I received (quite different to the design being shown when I bought it over two years ago)."
17045,5255,5," Game arrived in good condition& in good time. This particular set contains the centre piece for the Mexican Train game& but no mini-train markers (train shapes or otherwise) which disappointed the kids (I guess U can prob buy at a toy shop& otherwise just use coins or buttons at home for markers).Great game for all the family. Kids can learn strategy and counting up their 'dots' to see how many points they get. Granny's really competitive!!"
17046,5255,2," I've had to return this set as unfit for purpose& because they're so badly marked on the back that we can easily identify individual dominoes - no good when you're drawing from the pool and need a 12! Tried to clean them& but it looks like its just stained resin being used. Shame& because the price is right& but no good at all if you can tell which ones which without turning them over."
17047,5255,4," The actual concept of the product is great& it is a brilliant game. However the quality of the dominoe is very poor:The coloured dots are not consistant coloursThe colour of the dots are not fully in the dimple of the dominoeThere are indentations on the back of some dominoesThere are at least 2 shades of white used for the basic dominoeThere is differing thickness of dominoeI have contacted Pressman Toys twice through thier web site and have never recieved a reply.Double 12 Colour Dot Dominoes in Tin"
17048,5255,4," Generally very happy with this purchase.  The dots are clear and easy to see and vary in size helping make distinguishing the number of dots easier.  The colours are bright although often very similar colours are used for numbers quite close to each other& can be confusing in dim light.  There are a few smudges of paint on the reverse and sides of some dominoes and so far we haven't been able to remove these.  The dominoes do vary slightly in size.  This has caused problems as we bought a Fundex Mexican Train Game Hub Set (produces a train noise!) directly from Infinity Games (no postage and packaging to pay unlike Amazon!) with the view to using this with these dominoes .  Unfortunately some of the dominoes do not fit in the central well& not too much of a problem but not as satisfactory as it could be. The set does come with a very basic Mexican train game hub in the tin so not necessary to get a separate hub& we just like the one that makes a noise! Buying the two components separately did save us a considerable amount of money though (based on the price of the Fundex Mexican Train Game tin set from Amazon)!"
17049,5255,5," Mexican Train is a great variation on the traditional dominoes game.  It's totally addictive.  The supplied set of 91 coloured tiles are easy to read and very durable.  Delivery was prompt"
17050,5255,5," Excellent game& it will soon grip you and all your friends! Well made in nice tin and excellent value. I am so impressed I've just ordered another two sets for friends and kids!"
17051,5255,4," The Double 12 colour dot dominos is an excellent game. We were introduced to it as an after dinner game between the 6 of us. It was good fun and a cut above ordinary dominos. We thoroughly enjoyed it and so bought a set ourselves. It keeps you alert and is a laugh.The game comes with full instructions and in a good tin. You can play various games with it and I'd recommend it happily. The tiles have a nice feel to them too and durable."
17052,5256,5," They are great"
17053,5256,5," good"
17054,5257,5," Brilliantly simple game - for all agesThis is a simple game - an extension of basic dominoes& the difference being that this uses colours instead of numbers& and each |chromino| has three squares& not two.You have to lay your chromino so that it touches at least two already placed squares with matching colour - but no colours touching a different colour. Takes a little bit of thought and some useful 2D visualisation training.So that's the game. Unless& of course& you are Benjamin.Benjamin is nearly 2 years old and is my adored grandson.He loves all sorts of things and is just beginning to get the hang of jigsaw puzzles (if they don't have too many pieces. 4 is good!)His is also a dab hand at building towers of bricks and loves his DUPLO.Benjamin had a good look at the chrominoes& and has invented his own rules.You have to stack them up as high as you can until you can knock them over. You then laugh.You then get your digger (JCB in preference) and load the digger with the chrominoes... then it goes |Nrrr Nrrr Nrrr TIP!|His doting grandparents are assuming that he is learning his colours during this process - and are helpfully saying |Red& Benjamin| or sometimes |Look& Green& Benjamin|.He smiles and says |Digger| or |Nrrr Nrrr Nrrr| - so I think we are all having fun.No doubt in a while he will decide that the original rules are worth exploring - but until then... |Nrrr Nrrr Nrrr|"
17055,5257,5," We had an older version of this game and loved it. Recently bought this one for my grandchildren and they love it too. There are a few changes from the original but that makes it a little easier to play. This game makes you see things differently. The perception needed to find available location options to play tiles is a little different from in other games and helps kids develop ne ways of looking and seeing."
17056,5257,4," My Mums side of the family has been raised upon playing domino& card and board games so when this came along I knew that it would be something of interest to us& even though it has been awhile since we played together regularly.The first user of this game was actually my cousins 18 month old son. He was attracted to the box and had great fun stacking the pieces (and knocking them down again) and identifying the colours. The pieces are fairly robust (as is the bag) and I'm sure would survive a more heavy handed child and I think it's nice that even when the game isn't being played as intended that it still has a 'use' with younger children.As for the game its self I was worried that it would be too easy. It was however surprising difficult to begin with and you need to quickly develop a different way of thinking. This was really amusing for us as fans of domino games and great to have something different& particularly for the older players.We had fun playing this on Christmas day and were fairly relaxed about helping each other out& especially my 85 year old Nanna& who couldn't quite grasp that more then one colour had to match. I think for my bf& who is used to playing more tactical games& like warhammer& it was a little boring and slow paced& but the rest of us had fun with it and there was lots of banter. My Nanna actually ended up doing better then those of us who did understand the game& so there is an element of luck about which tiles you draw.I think& like most games& it does depend on who you play with on how much fun you will get out of it. I can definitely see us playing this again however and becoming a holiday favourite.Only thing that bugged me a little was the packaging.Read more â€º"
17057,5257,5," The game itself is well made with a sturdy box& robust bag to hold the pieces and the pieces are well constructed& too. This meant the first impression of the game were extremely positive. When we started to play& however& we encountered a few problems because the instructions aren't actually very clear! Once you can actually understand the instructions& this is a great game to play with many challenging aspects that aren't necessarily apparent from the instructions. I recommend purchases stick with the game& it is enjoyable and gets to be more so when you've cracked the rules! It would be better if the manufacturers rewrote the instructions and added more pictures to demonstrate options but don't let that put you off& I still recommend this as a great family game to play as it can& with appropriate support& be played by a wide age and ability range.Update review - 29th January& 2015We studied the images of the game in play on the box to check out permitted moves and found one that we hadn't realised from the instructions - what a difference it made! You can place a chromino so that just one square touches two others of the same colour (we had been playing so that two different squares on the new chromino had to touch . . . . We really enjoy the game now and play it several times most days when the weather is too inclement to go out! Highly recommend it - lots of fun :)"
17058,5257,5," I'd never heard of Chromino until now -  a play on chromatic and domino& the idea is to get rid of all your tiles first in order to win. A simple premise& similar to 'Go Fish' card game& you must place your tiles down next to similar coloured tiles& if you're unable to& you must draw a new tile from the bag.Simple and repetitive& the game is perfect for Christmas coming up and for when my two young ones get a little older.Highly recommended for lovers of board games and those with young children."
17059,5258,5," Great game& good price and speedy service& thank you"
17060,5258,5," A mixture having to go through the hole box of 9 puzzles for daughter to be able to  play the puzzles that's alot of puzzles and pieces to arrange before anyone can play"
17061,5258,5," Excellent game for children 3+ well known characters make the rules of the game easy to understand!"
17062,5258,5," Heavy box& little one likes them& keeps them busy for hours."
17063,5258,1," Not as I thought they would be"
17064,5259,4," Cards exactly as described on the packet.  Great size for little hands and the pictures are clear and easily recognisable.  Cards could be a little thicker as I bought these for my toddlers& but it does state 3+ on the front so hey ho... I chose these over others because of the upper/lowercase displayed next to each other and because of the variety of pictures on the reverse.  The instructions card that comes with it is a great added bonus too."
17065,5259,5," BRILLIANT flashcards. We love them as they have lower and upper case on them. I also like that they don't just have one picture on."
17066,5259,2," not good quality"
17067,5259,5," Great thank you"
17068,5260,5," My husband happily remembers playing Woodland Snap over half a century ago. In fact many of the names from the cards have entered his family vocabulary. |Mr Cunningleigh Sligh| the aristocratic fox with a shot gun& |Hoppy Spadge| the well dressed sparrow& |Barnaby Littlemouse|& |Millicent Littlemouse|& |Humphrey Goggle| the frog& with his wife |Mrs Croak|&  |Widow Pintips| the hedgehog& |Prettiwigs Pattikin| the squirrel& |Dr. Bunfuz| the rabbit& |Tippetty Nippet| the baby squirrel in bed& |Nubby Tope| the resourceful mole. All these names cause gales of laughter amongst the parents of our grandchildren who we are now busy indoctrinating with this hilarious game. Racey Helps (another funny name really) is a children's artist who is held in great affection. The pack contains instructions for playing Snap! and Grab Snap! in case you have forgotten the rules ( which have to be loose with littlies) together with the 44 cards which make up 11 sets of 4 cards each so there's plenty of chance of a SNAP! Playing this maybe together with Woodland Happy Families Woodland Happy Families the dark winter afternoons will lighten considerably. A jolly gift or stocking filler. Designed to draw parents and grandparents nearer to children with both enjoying the excitement of quickly recognising a double. but sometimes you have to hold back..."
17069,5260,5," I was so excited when I found these cards were still available to buy. I played with them as a child in the 70's and loved the woodland characters. They are still as charming now as they were then."
17070,5260,5," This is a lovely game& a great favourite with my children and now grandchild& played from 3 years upwards& over and over again!"
17071,5260,4," I was so pleased to find these cards& as I had the identical ones as a child and it brought back so many nice memories just by looking at the pictures! They are really beautifully illustrated and just great for playing happy families or making up your own games."
17072,5260,5," i was very happy with the item i bought bringing back many memories from childhood. Delivery was as stated on order so more than happy with that and therefore the supplier fulfilled its side. would recommend this supplier and use again."
17073,5260,5," Bought these for my Daughters who remember playing with a set as very young children at their Grandparents.The most delightful images reminiscent of those found in children's story books back in the 70s!."
17074,5260,4," Beautifully illustrated& this game of snap can be versatile...Snap and Pelmanism& and can be enjoyed by all ages& from 3 upwards in my family.  It has been a favourite for two generations."
17075,5260,4," Brought back great memories of playing in the 50's with my family and grandparents. Remembered the name Hoppy Spadge& googled it and there  he was& just as I remembered himâ˜º"
17076,5261,5," Our son got this game for is 4th birthday and he has loved playing it ever since& with increasing level of counting/maths. No one maths game is going to interest a child from early counting to more advanced additon and subtraction. But the beauty of this game is that you can adapt the rules to the level of the children involved. We started using it for basic counting& and now one year later& it really helps with addition and subtraction. And I expect it will retain interest and educational value for some time to come.R"
17077,5261,4," I have to disagree with the negative reviews. Both my daughters (one of whom is profoundly gifted) enjoyed playing this game. The beauty of this is that - yes& the initial rules are simple& but you can vary it to meet your child's needs and interests. I consider this sort of flexibility in a toy& game or book to be a great strength. So many modern toys are designed to do one thing and one thing only& with no room to stretch or adapt.- Is your bus full? Bring along a second bus! My children see this happen in real life& and use it as part of the 'story' of the game.- Is your bus empty? Roll the dice again!- We also make up stories about who is getting on the bus and how it relates to the pictures on the board.- You can use the top deckand the bottom deck for additional maths.Good games& good books& good toys& encourage imagination and initiative. That's up to you."
17078,5261,1," My 4 year old son was bought this for his birthday. It is a brightly coloured game and looks attractive. It also states that it |helps with adding and subtracting|. However that's a bit of an overstatement.The basic premise is that you start off with a bus with 10 empty seats& the idea being to fill as many as possible by the end. There are 2 dice& 1 tells you how many spaces to move and the other tells you how many people to add/remove. Each space has either a |+| or a |-| on it. In reality most of the time the bus is either completely empty or completely full for most of the journey  - we spend most of our time saying |well I'm supposed to take 2 away but it's empty so I can't| or |I'm supposed to add 6 but it's full so I can't|. The buses finish at different times so the end result isn't particularly exciting either.My son can't be the only 4 year old who finds the idea of counting between 1 and 6 people ridiculously simple. However he does rather like the game because he has his |favourite passengers| about whom he makes up stories. My 5 year old daughter will tolerate playing it once or twice. Older than that I can't imagine it having any value at all.I have always been a fan of Orchard Toys but there are more fun and more educational options than this one. For more fun I would recommend |Party party party| (advertised for 5-9 but I would say 3-7) and for more educational value I would recommend |Piggy in the middle| (advertised for 5-10 which is probably fair)."
17079,5261,5," This is an excellent game.  My 4 year old really loves it.  Basically you have to count people on and off your bus and make it all the way around the board.  Just for a change it isn't the first to reach the finish that wins but the one with the most people on their bus.  Because it holds his interest until the very end he is not too upset if he doesn't win.It's great to help with his counting and number recognition on the dice.  You have to use two dice so he loves that too and he has the rules better than anyone else so he is great at telling everyone what it is they need to do.In fact it was so good that on playing with his grandparents they immediately went and bought it to take to their other grandchildren at a visit the following week!Highly Recommended"
17080,5261,5," Bought for the 4 yr old but this game went down well with her little brother as well. Already been played many times"
17081,5261,5," This is a simple games that gets them to plus and minus without your child realising that they are doing maths.  It was bought for my 6yr old but with a bit of help my 2.5yr old can also play.  Orchard games are the best on the market in my opinion and I would not hesitate buying any game."
17082,5261,5," I bought this for my daughter as she loves buses. It is nicely presented and introduced her to the plus and minus signs& and helped her learn what they mean - much better than learning from a book or TV as it is a physical representation& it makes it real. The box says age 4+ but it wasn't too difficult for my 3 year old& I think the earlier you introduce maths in fun ways& the better!"
17083,5261,4," We have an 11 year old version of this game which my 5 year old is currently crazy about.This is one of a number of orchard games we bought when our 15 year old was in preschool. All are still in excellent condition despite often heavy use by our 3 sons at different times.What my youngest likes most about this game is choosing the passengers to get on/off the bus. I suppose it really puts them in the driving seat!"
17084,5262,4," Enjoyed by 8 year old girl.Gave a creative interlude during a party for girls and birthday celebration. Must sign off befor patience fails!"
17085,5262,3," I ordered this for my 7 yr old Grand-daughter& she was easily able to use this kit and had fun making bracelets for her friends"
17086,5262,5," Brought for my partners daughter! great fun for when the weather isn't great! she enjoyed it!! was very happy with the product and the price! delivery was fast too!!"
17087,5262,5," Had to wait till after birthday to receive this. But went well with her Christmas gift of the decorated headbands."
17088,5262,4," I chose this as a Christmas present for my grand=daughter as she loves making things and she really liked this."
17089,5262,5," Great product. Bought for my daughters Christmas. She will be really happy with this. Would definatley recommend. I bought another one for my niece. Thank u"
17090,5262,5," Bought for 8yr old niece as a little extra Christmas present. Impressed as looks decent and well made& nothing like cheaper versions I've seen elsewhere. I'm sure she'll love it."
17091,5262,5," Well presented gift giving hours of pleasure to my grandchild not only designing them but giving the finished articlesto her friends"
17092,5263,5," Zingo has really helped my 5 year old with the dreaded sight words. He loves the challenge of matching the word on the tile to his card - and he gets to shout a lot too! The dispenser is really sturdy and he like reloading it by `posting' the tiles through the slot. He's even sat and played it alone just to get extra goes with the zinger! Love this game. Think I'll get the French version for my 7 year old."
17093,5263,5," My daughter 3 loves this and treats it purely as a game. But the more we play the more she is recognising the words in the game. It is fun way of developing word recognition& having the numbers in is good as they are easier to recognise and this seems to stop her getting frustrated if she does recognise all the words"
17094,5263,5," great game & kids liked the dispenser tile part& very competitive to get all their words first& helps to practice"
17095,5263,5," My four year old loves playing zingo. Great for helping to memorise sight words however wish there were more words."
17096,5264,3," Good game but became repetitive after a very short time."
17097,5264,5," really great new game for us& fantastic for teaching too."
17098,5265,5," Fab train!"
17099,5266,5," great game for learning without realising. My 8 year old daughter will play this for much longer than doing maths homework."
17100,5266,5," brill game snd fun. doing mental maths with fun elements"
17101,5266,5," Great item for reinforcing number bonds and mental maths for addition& subtraction and multiplication. My 8 year old granddaughter loves the game as it doesn't go on for ever and the whole family can play with her. Also the cup cakes are lovely!"
17102,5266,4," Makes maths fun.Enjoyable game and very quick to play (older brother joined in also).Good travel toy also.Recommended."
17103,5266,2," Very tiny& not good value for money.  I was giving as  a gift and although the idea is great for the game the size was an issue"
17104,5266,5," Nice game not only when you want to practice math!My student love this game& verybody likes to win those nice cup cakes"
17105,5266,5," A popular game with children of different ages. I use it in private tutoring sessions."
17106,5266,4," Grandaughters engaged with this&although the four year old merely loved to hold them!!"
17107,5267,4," i bought this for christmas for my daughter to encourage her with her hand writing& and I was delighted to see how much she has enjoyed this toy. It has become one of her favorite toys and has been used numerous times. She has never tired of it and delights in showing me how much her writing has improved. My best buy& such a simple thing and so effective."
17108,5267,5," This is fantastic.  My Year 1 child is really enjoying practising his letters with it.  A really useful tool to help children with their joined up cursive writing. I thoroughly recommend it."
17109,5267,4," My daughter is 5 and half and quite a reluctant reader/writer.She loved this and wrote out all 50 words (twice!) in the first few days. The size is smaller than expected but that's a bonus& makes its easy to slip into a handbag& nd encourages her to write nice and small (I.r. Normal handwriting size - I'm  always telling her to write small letters). Love the flip hart design too& it acts as something hard to lean on.Lost one star as the pen nib got pushed in from too much writing - I've given her another whiteboard marker to keep going with."
17110,5267,3," Bit disappointed with this.. small and just few pages with dotted words to copy& really could do this yourself in a cheap notebook."
17111,5267,5," Found these very good. They are wipe clean which kids always find fun. The words are joined up which is what my daughter needed help with and the words on it are familar words such as home& brother. I found that because the item is so small and handy she preferred it to a big book. She is a reluctant reader"
17112,5267,4," Nice item my little girl enjoys writing out the words so it does help in encouraging kids to write more.  Good durable product which can be used over and over."
17113,5267,5," My little girl enjoys playing school so this is right up her street. Handy to take in car or out and about."
17114,5267,4," bought  to help my daughter with her handwriting skills. my daughter is 5& I felt that it really suits 6-7 ages. but good fun with dry marker& good to take out if you need to keep little ones occupiedi would definitely recommend itprompt delivery and well packaged."
17115,5268,4," I remember buying this for a young lad in the family and having a riot! You see while he was taking aim to shoot the targets off the fence with the infrared gun& I'd already programmed a universal remote ( hidden out of his sight)  to beat him to it! Wicked mischief!  I suffered for it& mind& when his mother sussed me!"
17116,5268,4," Bought as a gift for my Grandson. he loves it and it has lasted more than a few days without being broken which is something of a bonus!"
17117,5268,5," Brilliant fun. My 3 and 6 year old grandsons loved it and me too. Realistic sounds and the cans and bottles fly off when hit correctly."
17118,5268,5," Good"
17119,5269,5," A really lovely item.  Both enjoyable and educational.  Really loved by my grandson.  Excellent delivery as well - sooner than expected."
17120,5270,3," I thought this would be useful for my grandchildren but it seems that they are either old enough to understand money already or they have no concept of the meaning of money.  Hence& the product was not as useful as I had hoped for the purpose I intended it."
17121,5270,5," good for kids and who got maths problemshandy box to keep everythinggreat picturesBig writing easy to read"
17122,5270,5," Excellent a spin on bingo with learning about money taking away adding up etc"
17123,5270,5," Brilliant really good"
17124,5271,4," We have just been introduced to this game& and it's good fun.My only complaint is that with a little forethought the packaging could have included a box with an opening on the large side of the box to enable tiles to be replaced easily and neatly for storage. At the moment the opening is on the narrow edge making replacement of all the tiles almost impossible!As it happens my husband had to re-make the box so that we could use it for storage.A wasted opportunity to make a really good product!"
17125,5271,5," We have always enjoyed a game of dominoes when we get together with the family. When we saw this set& we just thought& how much fun will that be. Imagine being left holding double nine and paying a penny a spot! The quality is first class and the brass spinners are fab. We have already had lots of fun using them. They arrived well packaged in a box& but when you have used them& they are not easy to get back in the box so you need a pouch type bag to keep them in. But hey& hours of fun ahead."
17126,5271,5," Good quality dominoes.The experts tell me they're top notch although that didn't make ME play any better!Buy them!"
17127,5271,5," I was introduced to this game just a few weeks ago and found it great fun so decided to get a set for myself.Seeing all the positive reviews I decided to go for this set and certainly was not disappointed.The suppliers service was great and the tiles themselves were also excellent. I agree that it would be nice to have a box for them but realistically this would increase the price quite a lot so I will hunt around..for a suitable wooden box online or in Charity shops.All in all I have no hesitation in recommending these."
17128,5271,5," I have played with 9's doms on a few occasions and it is both fun and tricky.  Bought these for a family weekend party coming up.  They arrived the next day& great service."
17129,5271,5," Exactly what I wanted.  Nice set of solid x9 doms.  No box included but then you can't really expect that for the money."
17130,5271,5," We are very pleased with this item. looking forward to having a game with the family soon. Should be fun."
17131,5271,5," Great doms& very clear easy to hold and good spinners"
17132,5272,5," Easy to play& good fun and the best way I've come across to learn Spanish phrases.Well worth the money& I'd have paid more. Beats a phrase book hands down"
17133,5273,5," Excellent quality but not the most engaging of games. Best played in short bursts."
17134,5273,5," Brought this for my autistic son to help with his learning and is really good!"
17135,5273,5," A great resource to help children to develop their visual awareness skills."
17136,5274,5," Arrived in good time and is as described"
17137,5275,5," Suitable for a wide variety of people.  A game that doesn't make you feel  brain dead whether you win or lose.  Even the rest of my family who hate games&  felt comfortable playing it and enjoyed it.  Simple instructions and loads of fun.  It is unusual in that one player is all you need.  Very reasonably priced& easy to take away or even play in the car. Several other catagories of the same game can be purchased.  A good buy. For ages 8 and over."
17138,5275,5," This is not the first BrainBox box I have bought for my grand-children (three and one)& so that is a recommendation in itself. The earliest purchase on animals of the world had the question-box and an inflatable globe"
17139,5275,5," This was a birthday present for my 8 year old daughter& having bought a different versionfor a friends little boy who said he'd had a lot of fun with it.It is good fun& quite tricky todo in 10 seconds!"
17140,5275,5," This is a great game all my children love playing it. Its the look on peoples faces when you take the card away after 10 secs and they haven't had time to look at it all that they love. Although they do give granny three turns of the timer as she only has one good eye.They have played it so much and learned so much that I get beaten every time...They love it."
17141,5275,5," Excellent value for money. I have a number of the Brain Box range and use them at home with my family and as activities with students."
17142,5275,5," We first found these games at Hampton Court and my grandaughter bought one. We liked it so much we ordered a further two different titles from Amazon for ourselves. Very entertaining although 10 seconds is not long enough if you are getting on a bit!.I would recomend them to anyone."
17143,5275,5," Great fun had with the Grandchildren& particularly looking back on early inventions& e.g. telephones.  They are now only used to cordless phones / mobiles.  Opened discussions on numerous things"
17144,5275,4," Bought for one of my daughters . She loves this game . My memory is awful so was a challenge but fun at the same time to see what I could remember! Lots of interesting info too :-)"
17145,5276,5," Allow your child to play and learn at the same time theses e books are really good you will. Also be able to spend quality time with your child helping them brill"
17146,5276,5," my  Neice was  very  happy WITH  THE  STORIA  SHE  IS  HAVING  LOTS  OF  FUN  WITH  ALL THE  OTHERS  A WELL .  IT KEEP  HER  BUSY .  THANK YOU &"
17147,5276,5," my child loves this. the stories are good and she has had endless of entertainment from it. really good buy"
17148,5276,5," My daughter loves her storio and this is a very good addition to the storio range and good value for money"
17149,5277,4," i gave this game to my great nephew for his birthday he has thoroughly enjoyed playing it. It is educational and exciting."
17150,5277,5," A gift for my Grandson for Christmas - he loves anything to do with  'Cars'  and this is no exception& it trains the memory& and provides fun at the same time.  He wins every time as well!"
17151,5277,4," I have saved several sets of these cards over the years which belonged to my older grandchildren& so wanted to get some new ones for my youngest grandson.  I am keeping this for his birthday& so haven't played with it yet& but as he loves the other sets I have& I know he will really enjoy this one.  Taxing& but not too taxing& for little ones and doesn't take too long so they don't get bored!"
17152,5277,4," nice game for all children who are obsessed with the Cars franchaise.  Helps develop memory in a fun way .. and when played with the family helps starve off the early on set of Alzheimer's :)"
17153,5278,5," This is great. I first of all got it delivered the next day and my 2.5 year really enjoyed making all the puzzles"
17154,5279,4," Neatly produced& attractive card game& very informative as well as fun.Scoring system seemes a bit simplistic - we couldn't work out why you'd bother to |challenge| and could have done with a bit more point& or another& |bonus| aspect& to the counters but it's a hugely interesting& fun game that involves the whole (adult) family.Even those with poor geographical knowledge can have a |stab|& (and learn as they go)& and those who travel a lot or who have a PhD in Geography and who like to show off can rise to the challenge of trying to place obscure landmarks or places even they haven't heard of.We introduced our own |bonus round| by selecting out the weirdest& out-of the way names that no-one had ever heard of and had a |Who guesses nearest|& or a |What's this?| counter-reward in between rounds. I'll give the makers and other users this invention for nothing!Have recommended to several friends. Fair price& super family game."
17155,5280,5," Was not initially sure as I wanted a standard set but so glad they were out of stock. The tiles are a great size and feel. The tin box is maybe just a bit too big but that is the only fault I can think of. The price is the best I have found and we play them almost every night."
17156,5280,4," This was introduced to us by a friend.The dominoes take a while to get used to but each number has its own colour which helps.I wouldn't say it was a toy because younger children would not cope with some of the games suggested on the instruction sheet provided.We played a game called |chickens foot| which is really good and addictive.If you hunt round there are quite a few other games you could play too."
17157,5280,5," I knew it from friends and am very happy to have bought it myself. The only issue I had is with its packaging: it arrived with a 'dent' alongside the whole of the bottom of the tin& 90% of which I have been able to fix (It's a beautiful box and it is a pity it's a bit damaged). As the tin is fragile& it needs a better system of cushioning the tin inside the packaging box."
17158,5280,4," Nicely presented in a decent tin& the dominoes are good quality& well painted with nice colours and a good weight. They should survive the abuse my children are likely to dish out and have so far provided a few hours of entertainment with Chicken Foot (best dominoes game ever!!) Happy with this purchase"
17159,5280,5," I was very happy with the quality of this set of 12 dot dominoes. It comes with rules and instructions to play various games& but my family have only used the set to play mexican train dominoes. A couple of the colours are very similar& so we do tend to get the 9's"
17160,5280,5," I had been looking for 12-spot dominoes for a long time& why I didn't look on Amazon before& I don't know. The dominoes are of a good quality with different coloured spots for the different numbers so helping with identification. They are a good fun alternative to cards on wet weekends away."
17161,5280,4," We got the game following playing with a similar one at friends. The extra dominoes make it quite a challenge and opens up the scope for more games than would be in a standard set. The delivery of the game was first class and no complaints at all."
17162,5280,3," Great game& good quality but the metal container was quite badly dented on arrival.  However  we accepted the goods as the actual contents were intact& and we could not be bothered to return them!"
17163,5281,5," This game is a great game for the family or your flatmates.I live with 3 other people and this is one game we always bring out at least once a week. Its great for a group of 3-4 people& it keeps your attention and usually someone different wins each game. Some of it is luck- depending on what counters you pick up to start with& sometimes its a matter of how on the ball you are when it comes to placing the counters down stategically.Its definately a good game for travelling as well& once you take the counters from the box they can be placed in small bag and they are very light. Since its easy to learn your always going to have people to play with!Have fun!"
17164,5281,5," Buy this for any child who has the slightest interest in maths - like my nephew& whom I bought tri-onimos as a present.  He is only 8 and this helps him to think laterally& think ahead& and have a good laugh at the same time.Much more interesting to play that ordinary dominos& it is a toy for all ages."
17165,5281,1," Very disappointed with this purchase.  From the moment I took off the shrink wrap it was obvious that this was a cheap and nasty version of this game.  All you get in the box is an instruction leaflet (one piece of paper) and a plastic bag of poor quality hollow-back plastic pieces"
17166,5281,5," Having played |normal| dominoes a few times& and got bored of it fairly quickly& we decided to try Tri-ominoes.  It's absolutely brilliant!  Very easy to pick up& and rather addictive& we have found! In fact& we are so competitive that we have set up a league table!The instructions/rules are easy to follow - also there are instructions for simplifying the scoring if children are playing.  This game is very good for practising mental arithmetic.So far I have only played this game with 2 players - I imagine it will be just as good (if not better) with more players.  Highly recommended.  In fact& it's so good that I have bought a second set to keep at our caravan!"
17167,5281,5," This is definately a family favourite. It has been on holiday with us (just take the tiles out of the box) for the last 5 or 6 years and I doubt we will ever grow out of it. It makes a great timeless present for all ages with the exception of the very young."
17168,5281,5," After playing this for the first time whilst in blackpool. Had so many laughs so decided to buy it. Value for money 5 STARS!!!!"
17169,5281,5," I bought Tri-ominoes for my parents (who are in their mid-60s) after my dad had a serious stroke in 2007. Before dad's stroke my parents did not play any games& in fact my dad hated them& but after the stroke they have played it non-stop. We all believe the game has helped enormously with his recovery& and he actually asks to play it. I can not recommend this game enough."
17170,5281,5," My children (12 and 9)were playing this game for 4 hours travelling from London to Scotland when I suggested a break they had a gap to eat& drink and go to the loo before saying can we play again. I have ordered 4 boxes to distribute this Christmas and hopefully distract some families from electronic games.  Nice time to chat to kids again and helps with arithmetic."
17171,5282,5," Delighted with this product which was a present.  It arrived in good time and I would be happy to make a purchase in the future"
17172,5282,5," This was a present to my son. We played the game"
17173,5282,4," harder questions than I expected but good addition to board game"
17174,5283,5," I'm a nerd of Funko dolls and I recommend everyone who likes the bobble head& you buy them. I love it"
17175,5284,5," We have the adult version of 20 questions and enjoyed playing.  My grandchildren wanted to play and I was pleasantly surprised to find that they did a kids version.  Have played several times since receiving the game.  A good time had by all!"
17176,5285,5," Arrived in good time and exactly what I wanted."
17177,5286,3," This is a competitive chain-story game with cards for prompts and a buzzer device. The cards are done very nicely& with picture cards and word cards appropriate for different reading age groups. The buzzer is a bit cheap-and-cheerful. However& the real problem is with the rules. They don't quite match the supplied equipment& and the competitive aspect works against the story-telling rather than for it. If you're prepared to experiment a bit& though& you can create your own versions of the rules which work better.We tested this with a mixed group of adults and children& and then experimented with only adults on ways to make the storytelling more effective.The main problem is that the timer just doesn't work for the storytelling. Essentially& you wind it up& set it going& and everyone tells a bit more of the story using their prompt cards. The person who is speaking when the buzzer goes off gets all the discarded cards& and& after ten rounds& it's the person with the fewest cards who wins. However& even the mildly competitive realise fairly quickly that there are no penalties for bad storytelling â€” in fact& there are no rules to help the storytelling at all& except that you must say the word on one of your cards â€” and so the best strategy is to speak almost to the point the buzzer goes of& which you can see easily from the dial& leaving the next person with little time to add their section. It therefore just becomes a game of timing& not of story telling.I wonder if the makers were troubled by this. The buzzer itself has a start and a stop button& but the rules as supplied don't have any place for the use of the stop button at all.Read more â€º"
17178,5286,5," This story-telling game is for any number of players but 2 is not really worthwhile and at about 8 it may be too many - say optimum is for 4 or 6 persons& and of any age so long as players can read words - though some cards have helpful â€˜phoneticâ€™ easy words or pictures for younger players - the box indicates 6+ years.  It is a formalized version of the party game played by kids or even round the dinner table by adults - and it can be highly entertaining as it stretches imaginations& fosters quick thinking& and prompts competiveness.  The modern update is inclusion of a timer/buzzer (requires 3 AAA batteries) with a switch to start and an indicator of time spent/left.  There are 150 cards mainly with words but also double arrow cards to reverse the direction of play& and trump cards that can be used for any word& and allow players to remain in the game even if caught by the buzzer.After shuffling the players are each dealt an agreed number of cards (say 5 to 10) and the remainder are discarded and placed face down on the table.  When whoever is chosen starts (youngest?) the timer is activated and the player must commence his story with â€˜Once upon a timeâ€™ plus a sentence using one of his words - within a tall story& a funny story& a fantasy story& a ghost story or whatever.  He puts his card down and shouts â€˜nextâ€™& when the next player must take up the story using one of his words& place the card on the table and shout next& and so on until someone is caught talking when the buzzer sounds - that player has to pick up all the cards used by previous players plus a card from the discarded pile.The next round starts with the player losing the previous game but starts â€˜Twice upon a timeâ€™ (after that three times& four times etc.) as the timer is reset.Read more â€º"
17179,5286,4," This is a great board game for families with two or more children& I'd say. Like a lot of board games& you need more than two players to get the most out of it. The concept is simple and fairly easy to follow& although there are certain cards in the deck that complicate the proceedings and add an element of luck so that adults don't completely dominate!Based on words& language and storytelling& I feel like this is a good tool for bringing a little literacy into your game time without being overly taxing or difficult. At five years old& however& I felt like our son was at the younger end of being able to manage a game (which is fair& because it's recommended for 6+).Overall I see us growing into this and enjoying it very mooch at holidays& though I do question the inclusion of a battery operated buzzer. The real attraction of board games comes from being able to just pick them up and play& so it could be frustrating if the battery ever runs out."
17180,5286,4," We played this game the day it arrived and we enjoyed it.  We had two adults and two children (aged 4 and 7) playing and it seemed like we could all play as FAIRLY equal levels& obviously helping along the youngest and old fogies like me!We didn't really play according to the rules& partly because I'd read a lot of Amazon reviews criticising the instructions as not quite working.  I did read but then discarded and we played a slightly different story-telling game& hiding the buzzer and timing each game.We ended up playing for well over an hour and packed up before we were completely fed up.  IMHO& that's a pretty good average for any board game the family plays.I have to say we all enjoyed it.  It was very encouraging to see the youngest member of our group laughing and joining in (with a little bit of help) and I'd say it was fun and& as another reviewer has said& a good stocking-filler for Christmas.  I certainly feel we'll be getting it out again& although it may not be very soon.On the whole& an enjoyable and fun game and (probably) educational too."
17181,5287,4," I bought this as a gift for someone. It did arrive broken but I superglued it back together and its okay now.The item itself is really nice. It's a nice ornament and is well made. It has a decent weight to it so it can't easily be knocked over. I've heard people complain about it being a black"
17182,5288,5," I purchased mine from elsewhere but the product itself is spectacular& down to the last detail is a replica of Walt& the glasses are removable too& must buy for any BB fan."
17183,5288,5," Picture seems to be stretched& but i'm sure many of you guessed that. Very high quality& official merchandise. My dad was super excited to get it and he loves it! I doesn't come with a sticky bottom so you may need double sided tape if you plan to put this in your car."
17184,5288,5," This has been bought as a Christmas present but looks good &delivery and packaging very good"
17185,5288,5," My husband was very pleased with item .thanks"
17186,5289,1," A good game if all the answers were correct !! After playing it several times we have realised that some of the answers relate to different questions and some are totally incorrect so not much chance of learning. Buy it if you want to get frustrated. Whoever created this game does not know their general knowledge!&"
17187,5289,5," Bought Junior UK Trivia for as a Christmas present for my niece (age 9).  She absolutely loved it& this was played with continuously on Christmas day.  My niece is also learning from this game& and a great family game."
17188,5289,5," Great quiz game for all the family.  My 10 year old son and 11 year old daughter love it."
17189,5289,5," Great game& my children loved this.Has a great educational element to the game. Would highly recommend as Christmas gifts or for a game to play with the family over the Christmas period& perfect for rainy days!!"
17190,5290,5," Great product& come well packaged. Thank you very much!!"
17191,5291,5," fantastic game for all the family to use& would highly recommend."
17192,5292,5," This was what I wanted and arrived fast. Exactly as described on the marketplace site. and made a good present."
17193,5293,5," Really fun game. And posted straight away in time for Xmas - thanks so much for that!"
17194,5293,5," Great present& fun game& fast delivery thanks very much"
17195,5294,2," History Brainbox is the fifth game we have bought. The others have been excellent in every way& and totally enjoyable. This one is disappointing due to number of errors on the cards. No big deal if you are playing for fun& but not so good if you expect educational value.A sample of errors include a Lancaster bomber in the Battle of Britain& and 58&000 soldiers killed on the first day of the Battle of Somme. The illustration of British soldiers uniform in green is also a novelty. In the 100 years war& an english king in full armour with heraldic dress is labelled as a french soldier. The omission of Agincourt from the card may not be an error& but does seem curious. And did Shakespeare really write books& or plays?If you don't mind the errors& go and buy& it is a challenging and fun game. But for us its a shame that the manufacturers did not do their homework."
17196,5294,3," We were looking forward to receiving this game as it was a 'late Christmas present' and as we love History hoped it would help build up our knowledge.Whilst the game is quite good fun it is a bit thin on actual historical questions.  Most of the questions revolve around observation of the picture on the front eg is Robin Hood wearing a hat? and on Margaret Thatcher - 'is Margaret Thatcher wearing earrings?'Good for improving memory and observation skills& with some interesting facts& but not as educational as it could be."
17197,5294,5," My 9 and 13 year old love this game& they play it as a team so if there are 2 playing they get 20 secs to look at card then I ask alternate questions& passing to the other if the first doesn't know answer.Makes a great change from seeing them on the ps3!!"
17198,5294,5," quick fun game& can be played with as many people as you want for as long as you want. Kids might even learn a few facts whilst playing& which is a bonus!"
17199,5294,5," An inspired decision to purchase Brainbox History - the recipient loved it. This is the second Brainbox given to the same child as a gift (the first was animals)and I have been left in no doubt as to what W wants for Christmas"
17200,5294,5," I bought this game for my 9 year old grandaughter who adores history. The game is easy to follow& you can use it by yourself or with friends. My grandaughter is learning as she plays! Will buy more in this series."
17201,5294,5," Played this with |kids| aged 10-40 and ended up in fits of giggles. Now the youngest is asking for the other boxes too"
17202,5294,5," WOW what a fantastic game. My daughters were very impressed. It is a fun memory game which can be played by a group or solo. You can choose how long you wish to play for and will also help your childs concentration and memory skills. We were so impressed that we bought another 4 brainbox games."
17203,5295,5," My fiancÃ© absolutely loved this t shirt& little bit on expensive side but well worth it for a Disney t shirt she still got it now and not faded at all"
17204,5296,4," Great fun. Everything very small& but have used the ideas. Great for my 50th birthday sixties night got everyone going especially talking about the television around at the time.  Good value for the money."
17205,5296,5," best years"
17206,5297,5," This game is absolutely brilliant& it's like a sprint version of Scrabble but slightly different.  We had access to a game of Boggle over the summer holidays and never have I seen our 'I'd rather watch paint dry than read' son enjoy a game involving words so much.  It had everyone gripped from our 9 year old daughter to Nana who has two degrees in English.  The adults got very competitive and slightly ruthless as to words they tried to use and the kids practised their spelling without even realising it.  It's so good that I intend to buy a copy for us and 8 copies as Christmas presents."
17207,5297,5," Boggle is serious fun. Roll the 16 letter dice and make words. It's simple. Your words only count if you're the only one to have them. And because you reroll and reposition the dice each round& there's virtually limitless replays.The only thing I could fault this for is the minimum age. I'm not sure that 8 year olds would have the wordpower to use it effectively. 10 might be more appropriate."
17208,5297,5," so much better than the newer version which broke after a few plays.  this is basic and reliable and much more fun."
17209,5297,5," This has to be the best& all inclusive& family game ever invented.You can't beat this classic model."
17210,5297,4," The game of Boggle is fantastic& but I would get the |Travel Boggle To Go - Full size Boggle in a handy case!| instead.This version of Boggle& you twist to release the cubes and then shake them within a dome. You then twist back into position to set the cubes again. The problem with the fixed roof is that people tap on it with their pens and you invariably end up with little blobs of ink and scratches on the lid. It is also quite difficult to see the letters in some circumstances& we tend to play at night on a table with a single light overhead& and the light bounces off the lid and gives some glare& so you can't quite see.The automated timer is nice though - it kicks in when you twist the letters into place& and automatically beeps at you when your time is up. This is an improvement on the egg timer& which often gets forgotten if you've got a good set of letters and everyone is sucked in and not concentrating on the timer! The beep is quite pleasant - not too loud& just right really.I would say THIS is probably a better 'travel Boggle'& as the pieces can't get lost& so you can just throw it in a bag to take somewhere. For playing at home though& the old style one with the removable lid is better."
17211,5297,5," A brilliant game& easily portable on holiday&and fun for all ages and stages. Great for spelling and combine that with spatial awareness too. Most of all it's a quick& short game if you like& or endless hours of entertainment. You'll need some paper and pencils. Have FUN!"
17212,5297,5," The boggle we bought was an ideal gift as adults we had played with friends who came round to us and the childproof block enabled us to play a lot easier than with the adult version they had. It will also be suitable for flying abroad as we won't lose the blocks."
17213,5297,5," The reason I only gave a 3 rating was because the box was not pristine ( that's o.k.) but also because the timer when we came to use it kept sticking& so we will have to see about getting a replacement of the correct timing."
17214,5298,5," Bought this as a gift for a friend for her desk at work& good quality!"
17215,5298,5," Great figure just as described. A must have!"
17216,5298,5," Very pleased with detail& quality and size."
17217,5298,5," Well made good quality would recomend."
17218,5298,5," Bought it for a gift."
17219,5299,5," This product arrived on time. This was a present and the receiver loved it as he is a collector of Kingdom Hearts. I thought it looked quite comical and would put a smile on anybodys face. It is well made and a lovely gift& I would recommend this product to anybody not just a collector."
17220,5300,5," Great family game& we have a lot of fun with the combination of silly facts and wild guesses. It is a bit American-centric in content& and it is more fun wagering than learning trivia."
17221,5300,4," It's really good fun.1 of the pens ran out really early but the age range is very good. Not a complicated game.I bought this keeping in mind the ease at which it would be to include a blind person into the game without making any special rules.My 4 year old daughter enjoys it though I only let her place my wagers. The games are short so really easy to get people to play. I think this is change from the stale selection of games that are available year in year out.It fact it is a little pricey but I'm hoping the questions last me a year at least think it would be a bargin at Â£25 but hey it didn't stop me buying it for more and I don't regret it."
17222,5301,5," Ordered and received the Smithers Bobblehead swiftly from the buyer& came well packed too.I collect bobbleheads and was surprised to find Smithers at this price as I've been looking for it for a while."
17223,5302,5," I have to confess that I'm not much of a fan of Trivial Pursuits& the questions are always so difficult. Plus& some people in my family always take ages to answer the blooming questions. So& I thought I would test out a more up-to-date Trivia game on my folks. Result? Smiles all round. In fact there was a lot of shouting and screaming"
17224,5302,5," I love this game it is totally addictive and perfect for the whole family. Great mix of questions and different to your usual general knowledge."
17225,5302,5," This causes untold family arguments and laughter. Bought this as a Christmas day game- played Boys vs Girls"
17226,5302,5," Watch out Trivial Pursuit. I think Linkee's better. I never had a bad game of it& and that's saying something because my family have the attention span of a gnat!"
17227,5302,5," We were given this as a gift as we like to to play games with family over the festive period. A group of six of us played in two teams. We took turns being the question master alternating from team to team so everyone was involved. Each team was a man down when they were providing the question master. This is a fanatastic game as no one has to sit out like in Trivial pursuit when if you are on the losing team it is ages before you get a go. $ questions are asked and the first person to shout out the link between them gets that card which has a letter from LINKEE on it Sometimes we got the link on question 1& sometimes we waited till question 2 but of course the other team might get the link too so you had to be fast. Sometimes we never got the link and at other times with 4 questions and a bit of thought it came. The links don't require knowledge just the sort of mind to see the link. That is what is so great as you don't have to be good at general knowledge to play.A bit hit with our family."
17228,5302,5," This is a fun game& we purchased this as our new family game for Christmas.It's a simple game& you get four questions you have to answer and then you or your team have to work out the link& if you can't answer one of the questions it can make it harder.  There is a clue included but with a missing answer can still be hard.  The way to win is win cards& the cards all have a letter on them and you need to spell Linkee.We had a great time playing this game& the question reader may need a poker face as you don't want to  make it to easy.  It's not all easy some link are hard to guess.A great game to play with family and friends"
17229,5302,3," Like the game and it all arrived ok but was disappointed to find once playing it that it was the American edition of the game so some of the questions will not be relevant for us in the UK which is pointless if we need to know answers and link them up e.g. There were 4 questions that should have linked to Monopoly but one of the questions related to a place specifically on the U.S. Monopoly board. Very frustrating to have question cards we cannot use."
17230,5302,5," We were looking for a board game and wasn't sure if this was going to be what we were looking for.  It came recommended from a friend & so we took a punt on it& and what a cracker it turned out to be!Fast& fun and full of laughs - a brilliant game which we have played loads since with friends and familyHighly recommended."
17231,5303,4," A good& silly bit of fun. It does resemble the character and looks quite cool when you have the full set but mine was damaged and had to be repaired.  I thought it was just a one off thing& not to be worried about but I ordered four of eight set and three of them were broken.  I don't think this is Amazons fault but more of a manufacturing fault. The glue they use doesn't seem to be strong enough and the characters are coming away from their chairs or bases.  I have found that they are easily repaired with some good strong glue."
17232,5304,4," This is a nicely-designed tin containing 300 11x8cm cards& each of which has a picture on one side& representing the subject and three questions on the other. Picking one at random:--------------------------------------------------------------------------African Wildlife  card no.147Q1.  Do zebras have black stripes on a white skin or white stripes on a black skin?Q2.  True or false: An adult hippopotamus can run faster than an adult human being.Q3.  How many horns does a rhinoceros have?A1.  Black stripes on a white skinA2.  TrueA3.  TwoFACT: There are two types of rhinoceros& the white and the black"
17233,5304,5," My 6 year old son received this at Christmas and it has provided hours of entertainment for the whole family despite the fact that we have only worked our way through one of the pack of questions. Not a meal goes by without my son either playing Anne Robinson or being on the receiving end of the questions. Even my 4 year old daughter is enjoying chipping in. The questions are clear but are great for expanding their vocabulary and general knowledge. I can imagine this will be an essential when going on long drives."
17234,5304,4," I know life is happening in front of the computer now but I think this is a lovely little box of family entertainment for nice cosy get togethers. Nothing like it! Also great for foreign students practising their English."
17235,5304,5," This game was bought for my 6 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it& so much so that bed time stories are a thing of the past and instead she would rather me read her these cards. Some of the cards are tricky for her but this is a real plus point and she is learning so much. Would highly recommend"
17236,5304,3," We were sent this in return for our honest review.Kids Trivia Plus is a game for taking away with you rather than playing on the go.  It comes in a small tin which is perfect for packing in hand luggage or your suitcase.It is a simple to understand question and answer game.  Each of the three hundred cards included contains either a trivia question& fact or riddle.This game is aimed at players aged 7 and up and& although my 6 year old son understood how to play and enjoyed the game& there were a lot of questions he didnâ€™t understand or just didnâ€™t get at all so I think it is definitely one to keep until he is a little older.The quality of the cards and pieces is great value for money and it would be perfect for families with older children to take away on holiday."
17237,5304,1," This game is nicely presented in a tin box and has cheerful coloured cards and board. However the questions are either too hard or too silly. We tried to play this for over an hour and gave up frustrated. We had a 9 year old& a fifteen year old and four adults who could not answer many of the questions either. We are an electronics engineer& and deputy head teacher& a financial controller and a Nursery Nurse so we have the the mental capacity to answer most quiz questions.This has been a sad disappointment to our family. It was bought by the children's uncle who lives in Canada so we cannot send it back which we would like to do and gain a refund."
17238,5304,5," We discovered this trivia game in a cupboard in a cottage in Wales. It was fun for mum& dad& friends and my 7yr old boys& with the added bonus of being educational! My children do enjoy it more when the adults are reading the cards as well. The endless volume of cards makes it more interesting. It is one gift I will be giving other kids for their birthdays this year. I think once your child can read and enjoy playing games with other children& it is more enjoyable. It is not something you purchase to just read through. LOVE IT!"
17239,5304,5," Got this for my niece on her birthday and it has gone down a storm.  Regularly engage in this quiz which is so much fun almost every weekend at my mums when all the grand kids get together.  Very educational but so much fun& especially when done in teams.  Great for adults too."
17240,5305,5," Like i said& brilliant quality& just bigger than imagined and the head doesnt bobble all that much& but very happy with it. Hope the girlfriend is too!"
17241,5305,5," Perfect just as expected! Good packaging& the paint is great the build quality is great& and the overall appeareance is great!"
17242,5305,5," An extremely well made and fun item for any fan of horror or film in general"
17243,5305,5," Love these head knockers& fantastic on display and great to look at."
17244,5305,4," exactly as a bobble head should be. great for the collector"
17245,5306,5," Great item and quick delivery!"
17246,5306,5," Good condition."
17247,5307,4," nice :D"
17248,5308,4," Very family orientated game. You don't need to have a particular strength or weakness to play and enjoy this game. We tend to have gatherings of 9 or 10 people and this is perfect entertainment. Age or gender is irrelevant. Makes a change from Monopoly! The only slight drawback is the price& which I think a lot of people might find too expensive."
17249,5308,3," I love this game and own one myself.  I bought this one as a gift.  However it turned out to be the American verson which was a little bit disappointing as some of the cards have American names/answers on them.  Next time I will buy the game at Toys r Us to make sure it is the English version."
17250,5308,3," The game is ok& played it at our dinner party of 6 people.  It got a bit boring and predictable& I don't think it is worth the price it is."
17251,5308,5," Great game.  I would like to find the UK version as at least 20 cards are US based.  We took those cards out& I'm aiming to re do them with UK people"
17252,5308,4," Really nice family game. Have played with in-laws and everyone& including aloof& disengaged teenagers had a good time and really got into it. Makes for good& clean& fun quality time."
17253,5308,3," Not the most riveting of games& but we have a couple of family members to struggle with certain things so this game was ideal as they could be included."
17254,5308,4," Great game to play with groups of people - you get to learn about each other in a hilarious and boisterous way. Change it up by making it a debate& or try a voting system! You can be creative and soon enough everyone is yelling and jumping!"
17255,5308,4," This game + a responsible amount of alcohol + a group of good friends who are familiar with how each other think = an amazing time."
17256,5309,4," Bought as a gift for Xmas. Took a bit longer than expected to arrive but I had good communication with the seller.It went down a treat and he now sits with our plant named Groot."
17257,5309,4," Love my little guy and he came really quickly. Just wish his head wobbled more (like the others I have)"
17258,5309,4," Not my cup of tea but bought as a gift for a delighted teenager. Well packed value for money."
17259,5310,5," absolutely loved this head knocker&fast delivery and a very reasonable price&have started a collection that theyre so good&and great quality"
17260,5310,5," This product was just as described. Perfect adaptation of Freddy Krueger& every detail is perfect. Was delivered on time and very well packaged."
17261,5310,5," Love my little Freddy Krueger headknocker! Good quality& I'm happy with the product!"
17262,5311,5," Being the 100th Anniversay of the sinking of the Titanic we wanted to do something memorable and this will be perfect. Having played Murder Mystery games before we are really looking forward to this one. Quick response from supplier means we can get invites out quickly so our guests have plenty of time to prepare their costumes& which is all part of the fun hunting things down from charity shops and the like. There is alot of home printing to do (hence the low cost of the game) but it quite clearly states this before you buy it. All in all it looks pretty good and I'm sure it is going to be alot of fun as well as informative of the times in 1912!!Could be quite an educational evening!"
17263,5312,5," Love it!"
17264,5313,4," Good game for children who are interested in dinosaurs. My grandson really enjoys it as he can score well. It is easy to use and doesn't take up a lot of space so can be used anywhere -even in the car. Taxes adults' memories but is good for us."
17265,5313,5," This is a great game for dino lovers. My son (5) has been hooked on the 'Walking with Dinosaurs' DVD so this seemed an ideal present.The best thing about the game is being able to choose the question level - you can choose the one brain cell& 2 brain cell or 3 brain cells questions - so you still get the satisfaction of getting some right answers even if your knowledge of dinosaurs is fairly basic. It's an ingenious way of making everyone in the game feel like they're getting results& even if they don't come out the overall winner.The questions too are interesting and varied so you feel like you're learning something.Recommended!"
17266,5313,4," Product was bought for 5 year old who is mad about dinosaurs.  Comes in neat little tin and he loves it!"
17267,5314,5," Ideal gift for any star wars fan. My son was over the moon on his Birthday and the envy of his friends!"
17268,5314,5," Perfect for secret Santa& thank you"
17269,5314,5," Great product and service"
17270,5315,5," Had great fun with this at Christmas not too long so kids didn't get bored"
17271,5316,5," Got this for my fiance because she collects pony's.  Personally I collect bobble heads and found this to be an accurate reproduction of the g1& made of ceramic and with a unique bobble feature.  A must for Pony collectors and Bobble head collectors."
17272,5317,5," Great fun! Quick delivery too. Thanks."
17273,5317,5," Great stocking filler"
17274,5318,5," just right for Christmas"
17275,5319,5," Amazing - an educational game that my children don't mind playing!  My 6 and 9 year old love this.  You have 10 seconds in which to memorise as much information as possible about a country - flags& towns& exports etc.  Then you roll a dice and have to answer a numbered question about the country.  That's all there is to it.  If you answer correctly& you keep the card for that country.  The person with the most number of cards at the end of the game wins.  If I sat down and quizzed my children on their knowledge of flags& towns& countries& they'd find it really dull.  For some reason the egg-timer and dice turn this into a fun game for them.  What a find!"
17276,5319,5," We bought this game for my son's 9th birthday having no knowledge of it prior to seeing it here on Amazon.  We read the previous reviews and thought for the price it was worth a shot.  (Sick of the toy cupboard full of games which promise |hours of fun| etc which never get played) This little box is brilliant!  Our son is very much into factual learning at the moment and the wide variety of questions from colours on a flag to border countries and animals makes it a really great game for all.  The cards seem very durable being made of thick card and the language used is good for helping with reading/vocabulary.  Even Grandma with her great general knowledge has fun yet there are still enough challenges to keep it interesting.  The 10 minute rule has to be stretched as we so enjoy it that we keep going for another 10. It is compact portable and simple which is great for traveling and means you can pick it up anytime there are a few spare minutes which entertains board kids.  We have been so impressed that we are going to buying some more for gifts."
17277,5319,5," I bought this for my 8 yr old daughter and we play it with her 10 yr old brother. They both find it fun and interesting.I am pleased with it because it is about observation and remembering things about various countries& including flags& national emblems etc."
17278,5319,5," I bought this for the children for Christmas and we're still playing with it. It's a lot of fun and the fact that the aim of the game is who wins the most number of cards in 10 min.& means that you can have little sessions of it& so it's appropriate for children whose attention span is limited. It's fun because one might get the same card but different questions according to the number shown on the die. I'm thinking of getting some other ones from the series. Educational. Good buy."
17279,5319,5," My daughter (8) and her friends all love this game - they'll need to be able to read well enough to read the questions and answers& and adults may know the answers without having to reference the cards.All in all& though& great."
17280,5319,5," The BrainBox All Around the World game is good fun for all ages.  We played together as a family after a long lazy lunch& my daughter aged 9 and my parents in their 70's.  We all got some right"
17281,5319,4," The game is fun and you can learn a lot... Although is kind of repetitive because there is no too much cards! It is really instructive and helps you get some knowledge about different cultures!"
17282,5319,5," i bought this as a christmas gift for my 9 year old grand-daughter and she loves this and she is also learning as the same time."
17283,5320,5," This is a great little novelty toy& it would make a perfect Christmas gift for someone that loves The Nightmare Before Christmas& like myself. Overall I am very impressed with the quality and it is definitely worth the money! Very impressed with this purchase.It came packaged lovely& no damage to the box& or the product itself."
17284,5320,5," This is an awesome Jack Skellington figurine! I adore it."
17285,5320,5," Love this! Packaged well too& very happy with purchase"
17286,5320,1," Was not able to enjoy the item as it didn't turn up"
17287,5321,5," My husband and I are big animal fans& and we like trivial pursuit& but often find the questions a bit out of our realm of interest. This makes it much more fun for us& and also for quicker games since one of us tends to win fairly quickly. Note that this does not come with a board& cheese wheel or score-wedges like the full game. It comes with a carrying case& a pack of cards& and the dice to roll. You'll need to keep score yourself& or use the original board if you have a full set. You could easily fit a second pack of cards into this case if you wanted to mix it up with a different theme& and that's what we intend to do on our next camping set& as this is a lot more portable than the main game."
17288,5321,2," Currently playing as a family Christmas game. Literally have no idea what half of these questions mean... And that goes for my entire family.Genuinely think you need to have a PhD in Zoology to enjoy this game properly! But then against& that's kind of what makes this fun..."
17289,5321,3," Some very difficult and obscure questions in here. We are pretty well up on our wildlife& particularly my 18 year old son& but we were all struggling with this so we all got a bit fed up with it. A few ridiculously hard questions are great but this box is just full of them."
17290,5321,1," I bought this as the age was from 8 but as one review suggests you need a PhD in this field.... The questions are very hard and I definitely would not recommend it as we only new a couple of questions.."
17291,5321,5," Nice new set of questions. We also use them with the board& normal dice and rules of the boardgame. Perfect for animal lovers."
17292,5322,5," Nowadays with the WII & PS3 etc& at Christmas we have played as a family& Buzz& Just dance etc.Until now& we bought Balderdash and I must say I have never laughed so much in ages.The best thing about this is that my 12 year old can play (and won the last game) and he doesn't need 30 years of knowledge to know the answers& to be honest nobody knows the answers. That is where the fun lies.I will give you an example& one question was something like |In Texas& on the 1st day of May it is illegal to do what?|The answer is so obscure I can't remember. But the answer that one member of the family gave was |To carry your monther in law on your shoulders in public| and 4 people voted for it& giving the person who created the answer 4 points.This game is the best family game for decades.We are getting Dominoes and playing it again Saturday."
17293,5322,5," I just love this game.  Brought for Christmas and met with groans from several members of my family& it swiftly won them over and became a new favourite.  The premis is pretty simple& think call my bluff and you're there.One gamer reads out the card - it could be a law (In Ohio it is illegal to tip your hat at what..?)& initials (such as U.F.O. stands for what?)& a real person (Peter Smith is famous for what?) etc and then all gamers must write down an answer - only the key here is not to write the correct answer but something that you hope others will think as correct.  All the gamers answers are then read out by the question reader along with the correct answer and everyone has to guess which is the real answer.If it sounds complex believe me its not.  The real skill is in pegging your fellow contestants and coming up with bluffs that appeal to their idea of truth.  Fantastic fun& even for those who initially groan at the thought of it."
17294,5322,5," I got introduced to this game at a friends party and it was great! So I bought it myself and now got some other friends hooked on it. It makes a great gift for someone too. One of the best boardgames I have bought."
17295,5322,5," Balderdash is a great family game whereby players are given statements from different categories and have to write their own explanations for each. Next& they have to listen to each anonymous explanation and decide which is the correct one. Players receive points for guessing correctly and when other players choose their (incorrect) explanation. With a lot of cards and categories ranging from film plots to unusual laws& this is a fun and informative game that will provide hours of fun."
17296,5322,5," This game is brilliant fun and I'd highly recommend it.The concept is very simple"
17297,5322,5," This is a game you can take seriously or be ridiculous& several strategys exist if you are observant& and the mentally creative will have a real treat trying to decieve cogoal their apponents."
17298,5322,5," The hardest part of playing this game is mastering the rules. We are not an unintelligent family but we did have a few hiccups. After a little trial and error& we were off and the whole experience goes beyond winning and loosing. It's such a hoot you don't really care about the outcome. You can be old and a bit forgetful& young with a limited vocab& have learning difficulties& have several degrees& be competative& be reluctant& it makes no difference& you will enjoy this game. If you love English and words you'll love this game but you do not have to be clever. It's infectious and if you've got a little creativity or a sense of fun then this could really be the game for you. I own the game and have bought it as a requested gift. I honestly have not played with anyone who didn't really enjoy the experience and am happy to recommend it."
17299,5323,5," Love it. Goes great with my other Star Wars bobble heads."
17300,5324,5," This NECA Head Knocker is brilliantly detailed and is a must have for any Batman Fans. It looks great amongst the other Head Knockers but it's head isn't the most 'Wobbly'...It's still a perfect collectors item though and would make a great gift or display item."
17301,5324,4," amazing detail for a head knocker& and the price was a bargain& only one major floor is that it had plastic stuck to its face& which i have no idea was there cause it was wrapped up in bubble wrap& most of it came of but sum still on"
17302,5324,5," This item is amazing worth every penny looks so cool"
17303,5324,5," Love it"
17304,5325,5," Good"
17305,5326,4," I wouldnt normally consider picking up a 'cute' novelty item like this& however I realise that for some reason (probably the aforementioned 'cuteness') that Funko Pop vinyl bobblehead figures are extremely popular& and as a massive fan of Marvels USAgent character I couldnt resist.The figure works exactly as I expected to - which is to say that it does absolutely nothing except for& well& 'bobble'...I'm not sure exactly what makes the figure 'exclusive' as it is advertised to be. Presumable it was produced in more limited numbers and so is comparatively rarer than other figures.In terms of quality I did notice that some of the paint lines are a little scruffy on my figure (I am aware of the same complaint being made of other figures in the range). Additionally the red colour on my figure is a little lighter and closer to orange& rather than the deep crimson that you can see on the display photo. Without another to compare it with& I cannot say whether this is an inherent problem or whether it is the result of something like sun-bleaching.In any case& as a USAgent fan I am otherwise perfectly content with this completely useless and frivolous novelty figurine!"
17306,5327,5," Just as described& all parts present and correct and it came quickly. Now I need to see just how much attention I paid to the 80's..."
17307,5327,5," Great item& well packaged& quick delivery. Very pleased. A1+++++"
17308,5327,5," Excellent. Item as described."
17309,5327,4," Thanks for the prompt service and the game was in great condition. The game itself isn't quite as fun as I'd hoped but its ok"
17310,5327,4," Had looked around for this for a while as |an evening in with friends| amusement (we are all around 50!) Should be a blast!"
17311,5328,5," The festive force is strong with this one!!!"
17312,5329,4," Brought this as a present for the family. Good game that is not too time consuming. The cases are really interesting and there are some surprising outcomes. Good game for traveling could be played in the car if you don't use the die to determine how many points you get for guessing a correct verdict. In our family everyone is over the age of 20. The game says 12 plus on it and I think Children older than 12 would understand how to play the game but I don't think they would enjoy it/appreciate it."
17313,5329,4," This is a strange sort of game. On the one hand& you can rattle through it in practically no time at all using& for the most part& just a little common sense. And& since there are only ever two possible verdicts in each case& you've got a fifty per cent chance of getting it right& even if you're employing the services of a coin to help you come up with your answer each time.But& lurking beneath the surface& you'll find a very interesting collection of legal conundrums& the real-life solutions of which can really make you think. Each case and verdict have to fit on opposite sides of an 8.5cm x 5.5cm piece of card& so details are a little thin on the ground& but each verdict is explained pretty well. The cases seem to come from all over the place (especially the USA) although& sometimes& it's not even made clear in which country a case was heard. It makes little difference I suppose within the context of a board game but& nevertheless& it is a minor irritation.As for the competitive element to the thing though& I'm afraid I find the Rules of Play that they've come up with to be a complete waste of time. The game and its players deserve better: MUCH better.It is designed for two players / teams& aged 12 and over. Where they got that minimum age from& I have no idea& but the inference would seem to be that people younger than that would be bored out of their minds. I'm not too sure about that although& having tried the game out so far only on a collection of half-drunk (and& somewhat argumentative) adults& I've got nothing to actually back up that statement.You're split into two Teams (A and B) and you share a weird-looking scorecard and a die which only goes up to three.Read more â€º"
17314,5329,5," Enjoyed playing the game with family and friends. It is a fun way to encourage young readers and inspire reasoning and creative thinking. The product arrived promptly and in good condition."
17315,5329,2," The cases come from all round the world& and many are from the 19th century. I was hoping it would be useful as a teaching aid about law in the UK& but it's not very suitable for that.  However& passes a few dull moments& and didn't cost much."
17316,5329,4," Great conversation/debate provoker. Not a fantastic game to be competitive. More of an ice breaker to get a gathering going."
17317,5329,5," Great game& bought it for xmas and it was very enjoyable gave our families a lot of discussion and freindsly banter"
17318,5329,5," I bought this for a Xmas present not sure how often it will be usedConcept for the game is good though"
17319,5329,4," The game is suitable for the lay-man& not just the lawyer.  It takes as long as you want& since there is no defined end to the game.  Generally& the brain has had enough after an hour.  It`s very much a travel item& packed as it is in its tin box."
17320,5330,5," I purchased this game for my ten year old daughter for Christmas.  It is a really fun family boardgame so much so that the grandparents ended up playing too and we did not stop laughing.  Worth every penny for the fun value& would definately recommend it and of course it also has an educational element too."
17321,5330,3," Sat for two hours one evening and went through a quarter of the whole game! Better with more people obviously& but still good with two. Its a lot of money for a game that can be finished completely in only four decent games or less! Pictures seem a little bit blurry and the drawing is very childish so that in itself makes the game a bit harder... It is fun though and challenging at times for the right reasons. I think this is one game where it would be better by far to play it somewhere online. Waste of packaging to have a huge box with four small sets of cards and a timer. Overall& just ok& not great."
17322,5330,2," Good game for the family get together. only problem is& once you have played using all for packs of cards& you've pretty much finished with the game. you know all of the answers then and its pointless playing with the same cards.Wouldn't recommend this to other buyers& seems a bit over priced for 4 plays."
17323,5330,1," I'd give it no stars if I could. The pixelated graphics on the cards make the game impossible to play! And looking at the pictures and identifying what it is& is pretty much what the game is!! Very expensive game very cheaply made. Very poor quality. Ruined our Christmas eve game night as it was unplayable. My kids got increasingly frustrated and upset as it was too blurry to be able to make out the catchphrase cards. This meant they had no chance of getting any right. No fun atall!!!!"
17324,5330,5," Brilliant Family Game& really gets you thinking& very good value for money if my youngest who is 7Yrs could play it. Good for Christmas fun."
17325,5330,5," new and sealed so brand new - if you like the game show this may be a good idea for any casual evening dinner or family get together social  entertainment"
17326,5330,5," this was for my daughter in law&we had such fun with this&i sugest you all buy this as you will have lots of fun and laughter&great family game"
17327,5330,5," great game speedy delivery"
17328,5331,4," Great for a quick quiz"
17329,5332,5," I knew nothing about this game when I bought it but it has been a surprise hit.  It is a quiet game& perfect for a Sunday afternoon and a change from our usual scrabble.  It involves anagrams and general knowledge and is for three or more players where a series of clues are used to try and solve the anagrams.  The only problem is that you get through the cards quite quickly and after a few games most the anagrams become easily recognisable.  You then need to put the game away for several months to forget it all!"
17330,5333,5," Prompt delivery and the product was of beautiful quality& I ordered this expecting it to arrive AFTER Christmas& but the seller got it to me before then so I was able to give this as a gift to my friend on time. :DNo problems with the product& it got here in one perfect piece so thank you!"
17331,5333,5," Good condition."
17332,5334,5," If your youth was spent immersed in music& fashion and popular culture you will love this game. If you have team members who were watching Whispering Bob as well as team members who were satisfied with Top of the Pops you will really come into your own on the music questions! This was a great game for a family Christmas consisting of four 30 somethings and five of the older generation."
17333,5334,5," This game brought back memories of times gone by and all the family enjoyed playing it very much& I am glad I bought it."
17334,5334,3," I bought this as a stockingfiller for my partner"
17335,5334,5," Great condition and great fun!"
17336,5335,5," I am Gggrrrooottt! My favourite character in the G.O.T.G.Glad I got this. This item is class!"
17337,5335,5," Just the cutest! Great quality figurine as always."
17338,5335,5," Fantastic replica& very happy with purchase!"
17339,5335,5," Amazing. my boyfriend loves it! very happy."
17340,5336,5," A brilliant game based on very simple principles. The game consists of a bag& a timer and oval shaped cards on which there are the names of three people - fiction and non-fiction. The basic aim of the game is to describe as many people on the cards which are picked out of the bag to your team without naming the actual person in a set time limit. The game is reliant on verbal dexterity and quick thinking and anyone can play it.Sounds very basic but it fantastic fun and creates a great atmosphere in any party. It also sounds easy but it can be very difficult especially when you get stuck on an obscure person to describe. The instructions give a variety of ways to play the game but the best way to play is to get stuck in and play the basic game first as outlined in the first paragraph.Highly recommended."
17341,5336,5," Who's in the bag is a great game to take if your going on holiday& on long drives or flights& or if you just fancy fun on a night in.  The game isn't aimed at anyone particularly as all the names& characters& and places in the bag come from different genres and time periods.This game makes the time fly and although it does have quite a long life it can become boring if you play it constantly round after round."
17342,5336,5," What FUN.... this small portable game is so simple to use but creates masses of mayhem and joy. How refreashing to have a simple concept that requires no batteries& wires or plugs and is as easy to carry round as an evening clutch bag!! This game comes to dinner parties& and on every holiday we take. It manages to fill the room with laughter whilst learning. Although this depends how much wine has been consumed. Why not pit the girls against the boy's to see who is the best and to see who will try to cheat. This never fails to bond even strangers into the fiercest team...The only addition needed by the manufacturers is to create more cards...Enjoy the battle!"
17343,5336,5," With the prospect of Christmas looming many people will be dreading the thought of spending an excessive period of time through obligation with various family members.  If this is you then Who's in the Bag can help.It is like the name game bit and the end of the TV quiz show of 'They think it's all over' but without Rory McGrath and Nick Hancock.  It is pitched at children and adults with a variety of different people so you may or may not know what this person does but it is fun to try and infer the name without saying it.  It is less contraversial than Monopoly and causes less arguments than Scrabble and certainly makes the time fly& as well as allowing you and your loved ones some time to relax and have a laugh and forget what you had been stressing about all day."
17344,5336,5," I am 25 years old and bought this game on recommendation from a friend. I played it at christmas with the family who all loved it& from ages 13 to 60! Then I took it with me on holiday for a week with similiar aged friends& it was riotious!!! A great game to have at dinner parties. Only problem is I know all the cards now so need to order some fresh ones! Really recommend it& so much fun!"
17345,5336,5," Was introduced to this game by my sister years ago and has been a family favourite for all generations ever since. Like the other reviewers it is the simplest premise possible and provides hours and hours of great fun. Anywhere it's ever been taken has resulted in the same amount of pleasure being enjoyed by others and then usually to be borrowed back or people buying their own. The one star review has been answered by a few people so if you're in any doubt& ignore that review (having read the replies) and purchase. You won't regret it."
17346,5336,5," We played this game many times over Christmas& with lots of laughs. We had a great time with it. Children under about 10 would struggle& even with the childrens choice. I would suggest getting an extra set of names& as once you've been through the bag once or twice& some of the names become familiar."
17347,5336,5," Yes the idea of this game is simple and yes there is not a lot in the box - but if you give it a chance you can have a lot of fun with this game. We always have lots of fun playing at dinner parties and have played with younger members& but just give them a bit more artistic license with how they convey the message (allowing them sounds like etc...) If you are not sure who any of the people are& then I can imagine it might be as much fun - but there are three to choose from on the card and it forces you to just be a bit more imaginative (I personally think the people on the cards are very accessible - lots of Hollywood actors etc..). It is very much geared towards the British market though with some of the names relating to politicians like Tony Blair (although I think you would have to have been living on the moon to not know who most of them are!) All in all - can be really great fun and is what it says on the tin."
17348,5337,5," fantastic& such a variety of subject matter. for example music& films& general knowledge and science can all crop up on the same card - there really is something for everyone here. the kids enjoyed all the different challenge types too& on one card you could be doing a word search& the next might be |match up the pictures to the words|& the one after name the nine famous sayings linked to these photos. playable with 2 but really is best played in teams as you can pool your knowledge."
17349,5337,5," We had great fun with this game over Christmas& the family loved it.  It keeps up the pace& good for a laugh& and surprising how much you forget of all the simple things you know - it catches you out!  Use it for social fun& it's not designed to be an intellectual quiz& and play in small teams so that the pace keeps up."
17350,5337,5," a great game for all the family and all age groups. We played as teams and it was really good fun . Australian friends said that they must buy  it."
17351,5337,5," Loved this game& played it with friends on new years eve.  Card holder kept falling off the stand which was annoying and fiddly."
17352,5337,5," Great game we played xmas day after lunch&from teenage to pensioners we all had great fun"
17353,5337,5," Fun game for all the family  its a riot"
17354,5337,5," Fantastic Game& this really makes you think! would recommend& fast paced game that wont drag on! would recommend!"
17355,5337,4," Good game but when there are a lot of people it is difficult to see the cards."
17356,5338,5," This game fits nicely in before the Genus Edition that my 11 year old just couldnt join in with. This game gives him the chance to be equal and the 14 year old finds the questions easier than the Genus. Great fun for the family& it rolls along auite nicely and doesnt take 4 hours to play."
17357,5338,4," We brought this game for all of us to play in the family& children ages are from 10 to 14& it is really educational and fun. A benefit is the game doesn't last too long& before everyone concentration starts to go. It would be very balanced if grandparents and kids were playing it& because it is very up to date& often about TV or films& which older garandparents may not know& but they do know general knowledge.Well worth the money& we brought second hand& very good condition& quite expensive new.Trivial Pursuit for Kids"
17358,5338,3," Great general knowledge game for kids of similar age& but questions too easy for adults. We modified the rules so that I didn't get another throw when I got a question right and my two boys just beat me. Several question quirks in the game& such as |Is the main colour of a Mars Bar wrapper red& gold or brown?| and |Does the Playstation 2 store its information on floppy disk& cassette tape or DVD?| We think the PS2 store its information on memory cards& with game software being distributed on DVD (DVD-ROM to be precise). Somewhat surprised to find a question about South Park& which is rated age 17 and over!"
17359,5338,4," The game was educational and entertainimg and the arrangement of questions and answers easier to use than the adult game."
17360,5338,5," We opened this game yesterday and played with our 7 and 5 year old children. Both have asked me to review this on Amazon and say they LOVED it! I thought the game might be difficult for them but it was fine as the answers are multiple choice. Great game and definitely worth a 5 star."
17361,5338,5," Bought this for my class and they loved it!Excellent variety of questions from general knowledge to school specific questions."
17362,5338,1," Bought this to play with our 8 year old. We're not that impressed - the entertainment questions are well outdated - how would she know who played Dr Doolittle in a film made in 1998 or who on earth Martine McCutheon is? Come on Trivial - it's not that cheap and it needs updating. Shame - really liked it when I was a kid"
17363,5338,5," Great game-bought as a xmas present for my sons.They love it.Even my older boy who is 15 liked it although some questions were quite easy for him but there are difficult ones too.Overall a great game!"
17364,5339,3," like the other reviewer& I didn't read the product description to discover it's a modified version of Trivial Pursuit with a coloured dice& that relates to wedge colours& and question expansion pack& for the price I don't think it's worth it (and the price was reduced after release). The rules for playing with the dice are a bit confusing& but the rules card does give several playing options& the best way would be to either use the question pack with a Trivial Pursuit board and have a Big Bang Theory evening or use in tandem with the questions supplied with the board. It's a nice twist to the franchise of Trivial Pursuit to keep it fresh and popular but it needs to be made clearer as to what you're getting or priced more appropriately to indicate that you're not going to be buying the full version."
17365,5339,3," Just make sure you read the description as this is only the bite-size game. The seller should put this in the title. If I'm honest I didn't read the description and just went by the heading. So all in all I think it's over priced for what you're getting."
17366,5339,4," This is the smaller version of Triv - no board included& just the cards and a die.Based on the popular TV show& these questions are plentiful and varied and offer a good challenge for all levels. However even though I've seen every episode& I couldn't answer about 40% of the questions so it's certainly challenging.It's a more specialist and niche product& but it's great fun for fans of the show. Average value for money and lots of content& but just a bit too hard for me!Recommended"
17367,5339,5," Very enjoyable game which suits my teenager as well as myself and hubby. Game arrived quickly& well wrapped and in brilliant condition (sometimes they can be slightly damaged from delivery with poor packing) with no marks or dents to the box. My teenage son was very happy when he opened it on his birthday."
17368,5339,5," This is a great travel companion. I don't understand the other reviewers. Trivial Pursuit as a big box game costs over Â£30 so how anyone can get confused thinking this is the same format is strange.Anyhow& our family loves the show and this is a great game to test all our knowledge. For all lovers of the show this is a must. 10 out of 10"
17369,5339,4," Bought this for my 12 year old niece who loved it. Only slight downside is that the answers can be a bit repetitive as they are quite often just members of the group. So sometimes it just became a 1 in 6 chance guessing game.Still great though for BBT fans."
17370,5339,3," I got this big box of questions for my 11 yr old for xmas& thinking we as a big-bang-fan-family could have fun with this over the holidays. as i turns out the questions were way to difficult for what I had in mind."
17371,5339,4," Good family game if you watch the show regularly& not for the casual viewer.  Some questions are a bit obscure& would be worried that whoever new the answers spent too much time watching the show."
17372,5340,4," I bought this as a gift. Nearly kept it for my self I liked it that much. Only problem was when removing it from the foam the wing mirror broke off so watch out for that when opening."
17373,5341,4," This game is very enjoyable. Although it says you can play with 2 players this seems almost impossible to win according to instructions. Much better with at least 3 players or teams."
17374,5341,5," Bought this after purchasing and enjoying playing The Logo Board Game.  Good fun family game but best played in mixed age group teams as some of the questions are geared towards the more mature.  Scoring by moving to the appropriate coloured square also makes the game more fun as answering another teams question after they have got it wrong can propel you forwards and similarly& if you get your question wrong& it can really hold you back.All round good fun game that the whole family enjoyed."
17375,5341,5," I brought this for my family Christmas - especially as there was going to be a mixture of ages from 16 to 73 years old playing the game.  This was great fun and we all learnt a lot of useful things about the UK - much better than trivial persuit"
17376,5341,5," This game challenges the younger players and racks the brains of those more mature players but it is equal fun for all and each game doesn't take ages to play so it cam be enjoyed time and time again."
17377,5341,5," This game really gets you thinking of days gone by. We played the game in two teams girls v boys it can become very competative but great fun.It can also be played with up to six players. It also educates you while you are having fun. It has various questions on general knowledge and British logos some modern and some from days gone by. Ideal for a mixed age group it is easy to set up and the instructions are easy to understand. We also have the other game in the range LOGO which is just as good to play."
17378,5341,4," I am an Italian English teacher. this board game is very useful to teach a bit of British culture and way of life....there are some curiosities&  pics and many ideas to teach Britishness and English in a less scholastic way!I tried it with my teenager students and they went nuts about the game! they love to find more information about the answers on the net and they began to understand that every culture is peculiar and it is worth to know it better and to understand it!"
17379,5341,4," Played game with children and adults.  Children preferred LOGO. Adults enjoyed game but felt it was geared more for English rather than  British. Nevertheless it was good fun."
17380,5341,1," We thought the questions were quite difficult with a wide range of ages playing. The logo game by the same company was much better. I have said to the family to sell this on as it will just sit in the cupboard unfortunately. Questions on Shakespeare& Olympic Games prices and timings for a particular round are just a few examples of very difficult questions. This seemed to not want you to take part as people lost interest."
17381,5342,4," I like board games& so bought this for Christmas to see if it was any good.  Didn't expect too much as it's just a taster& but enjoyed it.Found it a bit difficult to work out the rules& although that might have had something to do with having had a few before playing.  Also as a woman I found the Hers questions slightly offensive as I didn't know most of the answers!  I guess if you're a girly girl you'll probably have more luck with them& however both my team mate and I found the His questions easier.Could get quite a few games out of it& as we only used a fraction of the cards before finishing the game.  Probably a good thing& as will probably get boring if too long."
17382,5342,3," A good little game for the dinner table. We played it after dinner& but after a few rounds it got a little tedious. But great for quiz lovers."
17383,5342,5," This game is absolutely hilarious. So much fun& great for a family gathering or evening in with friends& the more the merrier. Best played when you split boys against girls. It doesn't matter what age you are& although some of the questions might not be suitable for young kids. It doesn't take long for there to be some friendly name calling and whoops!!We bought this for an after dinner game with family& ages between 17 and 84& and it was an absolute hoot!"
17384,5342,5," Good game to play with group of friends and family"
17385,5343,5," I received this in post early which was great! and I decided to put this in my car (I used sticky pads that I got from a stationary shop called ''the works'' to use so it sticks to the dashboard)and it's still in my car without any issues of falling off ect.It looks awesome in my car!& defiantly worth the buy and is great quality& totally recommend this seller!"
17386,5343,5," Every bit as good as the description&good quality product delivered earl and very well packaged I would recommend this seller."
17387,5343,5," Great"
17388,5344,5," Great model and completes my set. Has the expo sticker on the box."
17389,5345,4," great pub quiz questions"
17390,5346,5," Had hours of fun with this over Christmas period& great value for money"
17391,5346,5," loved it &played with family on xmas day&well worth the price."
17392,5346,3," have seen a lot better questions"
17393,5346,5," Good fun"
17394,5346,5," A*"
17395,5347,5," We have the original Logo game and have played it so many times with family and friends. We bought this version mainly for the extra cards to supplement our original game."
17396,5348,5," Great product for a chrimbo stocking& have had much fun with it& all my comments will be the same if you ask me to write so many words and they wont really be worth it."
17397,5348,4," Pocket size game - compact and fun"
17398,5348,3," Good fun"
17399,5349,5," Great table top game - I used this after Christmas lunch and it went down well with older kids and adults.  Would recommend for any dinner party especailly one where maybe everyone does not know each other as it would certainly break the ice"
17400,5350,5," Love this bobble head meerkat - always gives me a chuckle in the car.  Sticks onto a parcel shelf or dashboard easily!  Really brightens up long car journeys!  Would highly recommend!"
17401,5350,5," This is so adorable. Great quality and is always bobbling his head. I bought it for my 17 year old son and I just know he is going too love this. I definitely recommend. :)"
17402,5350,5," Great& looks funny while standing on my dashboard whenever Im behind the wheel. Love it so much!:)Thank you Im so pleased."
17403,5350,4," This is a great novelty for your car and amuses anyone that gets in mine. The head gently bobbles so doesn't put you off driving or irritate your concentration. One word of advise......mine stuck straight away on my car dashboard (fiesta)but my friend (corsa) needed to stick hers with superglue in end as it wouldn't stick at all to her dashboard.....no idea why!!"
17404,5350,3," I got this for a friend Birthday as she is Meerkat mad.  The only thing was that she could not get it to stick to the dashboard in her car& seemed to heavy for the sticky pad on the bottom."
17405,5350,5," Great product&  busy_bee were extremely helpful when the item got lost in the post and sent another one for me. Top seller and definitely recommend!"
17406,5350,5," I just love it and my Grandson loves it. I have had it six months now. It has stayed in place and never fell off."
17407,5350,5," I bought this for a friends birthday.  She's a big Meerkat fan and she loves it.  He bobs away happily."
17408,5351,5," Bought as a gift& but we had a few sample 'name 5' cards in a kids Brain Box. My whole family (incl. 6"
17409,5351,5," I recently had a sample of this game with another game I brought and my family love it! Ok there's no answers but who doesn't have google close by to check. We love that there are questions for all ages and questions that are easy and not so easy! It definitely will get you thinking that's for sure :)"
17410,5351,1," Rubbish game.No answers - little guidance.  Not much good for a very competitive family who question the answers given!"
17411,5351,5," We played this in teams& the youngest child was 6 and the oldest one 73... it is a brilliant family game with a good variety of questions that ensure everyone can answer some. We had lots of fun and a lot of laughs& so glad I got it as a rematch has already been arranged!"
17412,5351,5," Great"
17413,5352,5," Had great fun with this over Christmas"
17414,5352,4," bought as a xmas present so cannot evaluate the game"
17415,5353,4," This game is very good and it is very much like being in the set of the show. I would recomend this game as it has some very hard questions and also some designed for the younger amoung us. The minimum age is 12 so it shows you how hard it is going to be. It is definately a good game and everyone should own a copy of it."
17416,5353,5," You Hear of the Hit Quiz show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. Have you ever dreamed of winning a million bucks.Now you can try to climb to the top of the ladder of money. Who Wants to Be a Millionaire is a great game for the family. My kids have learnt alot for this game and so have. When we are boarded to death on a rainy wet day (and a lot of the time we are). We open the cupboard and pull out Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. That turns our day for Rain to sun shine. It is a must get board game for the whole family. I total it is the best and greatest game we as a family have played."
17417,5353,4," For many& the idea of competing to win a fictious Â£1 million is not the best way to spend an evening. However& I would challenge anybody not to play Millionaire and not to see the competitive streak come out in them.When you all huddle round to play& it does feel like a bit of harmless fun. The real problems start when others start trying to convince you that answers are right. When they're wrong& you feel anger towards them! Any game that can get you excited or depressed over the chance to win a paper Â£1 million must be good.What Millionaire does is to get the whole family involved. If you are prepared to the tension get a little heated on a Saturday evening& then this is just the game for you."
17418,5353,5," arrived in great time&description was :damage to box: but this was very mild &hardly noticable&we had great fun with this game and plan to have alot more.great seller"
17419,5353,4," Fun&educational and just great.My kids just love to play this game on a stromy day.But is still a great game from adults. in total get it to have a great & jolly good time ."
17420,5354,5," We invited 3 other couples for our Dinner with the Mafia and it was a great success. Just add some hooch and casino games. We were very impressed that everyone arrived in character& but then it was an invitation they couldn't refuse! Very reasonably priced for something so comprehensive and can be used again!"
17421,5354,4," Great for a dinner party. But the CD is a bit rubbish...but all the other things are a great base."
17422,5354,5," prompt service& very pleased"
17423,5354,2," Dissappointed& with this I have done a murder mystery party before which had comprehensive mystery& with disk which set the scene at the beginning and each character had a good description& with tips on playing their character and there were questions to ask which guided you through also on the invitation it told the  one guest who was the murderer.This game had good menu& the disk was just terrible music and the cards were general knowledge of gangsters.If I had known through the description it was going to be vague and didnt have everything you needed I would have sent it back& before bursting the seal.I suggest you try another make!"
17424,5355,5," Gift for sister& absolutely loved it& quick delivery& very pleased!"
17425,5355,5," Great product& speedy delivery!"
17426,5355,5," I love it!"
17427,5355,5," Love it"
17428,5356,5," Great for car journeys"
17429,5356,5," Lots of fun"
17430,5356,4," I had expected more of a game as opposed to a set of cards with trivia on so returned as not what I had expected but there was nothing wrong with the cards if this was what you wanted."
17431,5356,5," Got these cards for a bit of fun around the dinner table. Lots of cards in the pack and loads of different genres so questions for everyone. Good fun!"
17432,5356,5," Haven't played it yet& but if its as good as the tv and film trivia version& it'll be brilliant fun!  So I'm giving it top marks in anticipation!"
17433,5356,5," Great fun for all.  Both us 50 something's and the 20 something's.  But we did need to mix teams."
17434,5356,5," Quite a few tough questions. I guess it all depends on peoples interests. Good value though."
17435,5356,4," bought as xmas present so cannot evaluate"
17436,5357,2," we bought this after reading raving reviews& great game but we used all the cards within 2 games so now it is useless - amazing how much your kids know and you don't - only worth buying to replace a day at legoland etc to warrant the price as have not found anywhere they sell other question cards"
17437,5357,3," Great concept of an idea& lots of fun with the whole family. We are a family of 4 which fits great with the game.... Not sure if you could play with more than two children and two adults.... Which is a shame. Simple concept& nothing too difficult."
17438,5357,5," .....though I'm not so sure about my daughter and son-in-law as they keep getting soundly trounced by the kids who& of course& keep wanting to play it show up mummy and daddy!But the kids love it so my work here is done! :-)"
17439,5357,4," Played with a 7 year old (too difficult) and a 10 year old (fine if slightly too easy).  We got as a present so happy enough."
17440,5357,4," Arrived on time& good quality& worth the money"
17441,5357,5," My kids loved this. It's really easy to set up and play. Really improves their creative thinking. Great fun for both kids and adults alike."
17442,5357,4," This game is fun to play with your family and it joins you together for great fun. It also gives you new info. you might've not already known. Thank You."
17443,5357,5," Our Grandchildren loved this game. Especialy the title of it.So would reccomend it to occupy children on a rainy day."
17444,5358,4," ordered hermoine but received Harry Potterbobble head instead but just kept it as it was nice also. bought for daughter as she is mad on th movies"
17445,5358,5," I bought this for my boyfriend's birthday& he loves Harry Potter and he was very pleased with this gift:) The shipping was really fast."
17446,5359,1," Ok this didn't cost a lot but never-the-less this was useless as a game. I ended up using it to design a quiz but even then some of the answers are so obvious it would be insulting to a 5 year old. It doesn't come in a storage 'tub' as the picture appears to show& so the pieces are all loose. The whole thing went straight into the bin after I did my quiz!"
17447,5359,4," Gun to use with adults and children but the packaging is flimsy and fell apart after a couple of uses."
17448,5359,5," Good stocking filler and value for money not a problem at all with delivery or supplier all very good. Cannot say if game offers hours of entertainment as it's not christmas yet!"
17449,5359,5," Great version of the larger game& small enough to take on holidays& I bought other small ones as well& if you want to make the game last longer like the larger versions& just put all the cards together from all the small games& and use any board& fun fun fun"
17450,5359,4," This little game went down a treat as a stocking filler for friends abroad.  Nothing fancy& but a little bit of British fun for a Christmas add-on."
17451,5359,4," I played it with a mixed group of age people from 11 years up& and everyone enjoyed it. We used the cards from this game with the logo game board."
17452,5359,5," I would recommend this product to anyone as being a terrific 'taster' for the full board game.  Innovative packaging and great value for money."
17453,5359,5," I ordered for a friend as a birthday present. She loved its small size and ease with witch she could carry around.Great game!"
17454,5360,4," A good game. The cards are the right design to be able to use them as an add-on to an existing set& and the modified game-play that comes with the cards is excellent for when you're travelling or just want a quick game. My only complaint is that the deck is strictly movie-only questions. As a fan of the books first and primarily& it would have been good to have at least one category for trivia that is book specific given there are a number of differences. We've found ourselves double-checking answers on more than one card because we were sure the card was wrong& only to find our answers came from the books rather than the films."
17455,5360,5," It looks great: original packaging& small and easy to store. The questions are a great mix of easy& medium& difficult and |hardcore Potterhead|. I would definitely recommend this."
17456,5360,3," There isn't a board so it's essentially a question and answer game which isn't what I was expecting. Also& some of the answers are incorrect but only complete nerds (like me) would notice.. Some of the answers for example& are incorrect according to the books but are correct according to the films so watch out for that if you have a BA Hons in Harry Potter."
17457,5360,4," Great game for real Potter fans. Only 4 stars though as some of the answers were not quite right and depended on if you had watched the film or read the book. They need a consistent approach and just use the book in my opinion. Still a good game which we have played many times."
17458,5360,4," It would have gotten 5 stars if there were more questions because for a major harry potter fan 100 cards are not enough."
17459,5360,5," My teen Harry Potter mad daughter loves these cards. They were a small extra birthday gift. Only issue is she can only play with another HP fan. When we play trivial pursuit as a family we let her have a question from this pack.She knows all the answers but this has been a great little gift."
17460,5360,5," As I have friends who are Harry potter mad& myself included this game is so fun! The only things that us annoying is that there is no slices of the pie so you need to keep track of what you have got colour wise and what you still need to get"
17461,5360,5," I really enjoyed this game. I was a little put out after searching for my Trivial Pursuit game to find that I did not need it for this set of questions though. I also have to say that you need to have read all the books to answer some of the questions& just watching the films will not suffice. Even so& it was a great game and hilarity was had by all ages."
17462,5361,2," Unless you really study all the James Bond films with the actors& directors& producers etc& this is not for you.  Tried playing it over Christmas& my son is an avid Bond Film watcher& but even he had difficulty answering the questions."
17463,5361,3," These questions are so.hard& I thought I was quite a fan of James Bond till I tried to answer some of these. Not just a light but of fun you need to be a superman to get these"
17464,5361,2," The game itself is well researched and structured& but is too hard to play unless you are a Bond nerd. This was bought to play in the Christmas holiday and was played once."
17465,5361,5," I'm not big on James Bond but bought this for someone who is and they love it. Variety of films are used and they find it quite tough."
17466,5361,5," Christmas gift that was well used after dinner& recipient is a James Bond fan."
17467,5361,5," Quick Delivery& really pleased& good quality product& many thanks"
17468,5361,5," Quick delivery and a good game for bond fans"
17469,5361,4," bought as a present and was well received."
17470,5362,5," My seven year old loves it and has gone on to make 100's more! I would definatly recommend to anyone"
17471,5362,5," Bought as a present for my 10 year old daughter who has made lots of her own in the past.  She absolutely loves it!  There are lots of options to make like favourite animal etc and kept her& and us& entertained for hours!  A great Christmas gift."
17472,5362,2," Not what expected but ok for school kids to keep them busy in wet play"
17473,5362,4," Great present"
17474,5363,5," I bought this and the others in the series for a family party. Everyone enjoyed playing the quiz and the varied points values means that you don't need a wide knowledge to score well."
17475,5364,5," Good product and service"
17476,5365,5," I'm a huge Star Wars fan& so I bought this BB-8 figurine for my desk and I have to say that is better and cuter that what I expected. It arrived super fast without problems and it looks awesome. Totally recommended."
17477,5365,4," My Grandson loved it. Especially as it was new to Star Wars."
17478,5365,5," Perfect"
17479,5366,5," Love it would recommend to any Star Wars nut"
17480,5366,5," love it"
17481,5367,5," I absolutely love it! The attention to detail is amazing and I especially love the crown! This is by far my favourite pop vinyl figure and I would definitely recommend it to a collector or just a fan such as myself because it looks absolutely brilliant."
17482,5367,3," Great product and fantastic level of detail. Would give this 5 stars but it arrived damaged and had to be realigned by myself before displaying it. An awesome product nonetheless!"
17483,5367,2," Box wasn't taped so could of been opened - it looked like it was - then there were a heap of really noticeable marks on front of face"
17484,5367,5," Very pleased exactly as described came so quickly"
17485,5367,5," Lovely and simple shopping experience!"
17486,5368,5," I have always loved the movie Forbidden Planet. I was looking online for a model kit of Robby The Robot and came across this product. The other models were quite expensive.This is a really good likeness and it is well made.I think that it is good value for money.I hope that the maker of this product produces more models."
17487,5368,5," If you dont know this robot you must have grown up without a t.v.  its good quality and hard as nails"
17488,5369,5," This was a gift for our soon to be Son in Law. He likes it very much. Small and neat yet personal and fun. What better gift?"
17489,5369,5," Having a game with their own name is a nice way to make a child feel special...but be prepared to play it with them!"
17490,5369,4," Loved the idea of this being personalisedA fun item in my sons stockingk"
17491,5369,5," Amazing product& just wish you had more names& especially girls."
17492,5370,5," This is a very well made product and really looks like Jesse. I really need to stop buying these things I'm 31"
17493,5370,5," Excellent! I bought it for my Mum as a little thank you gift and she's over the moon. The product itself is very nice. The picture is good but it looks so much better out the box. Nice details such as Jessie's tattoo on his arm are visible& also the base looks much neater with a better shade of blue. Another review said the resemblance wasn't great& I disagree. It's not perfect but it's close. I'm sure I'll be getting Walt and Saul next. Hopefully they release other characters such as Mike"
17494,5370,5," Arrived in great condition and a day before it was due. Perfect desk toy looks great& would recommend for any bb fan"
17495,5370,4," Eyes not quite ...there but tatoo cool"
17496,5370,3," Bought as a gift& recipient wasn't overly impressed& I should have gone for the Walter figure& it would have been more like the character"
17497,5370,3," Looks a little cheap& but overall it is okay"
17498,5371,5," Great product"
17499,5372,5," Very good quality and will last a lifetime."
17500,5373,5," Absoultly outstanding detail probably the best captain america from hot toys yet likeness 10/10 articulation 10/10 quality 10/10"
17501,5374,5," Fantastically packages product! Loved the free tea gift! Will definitely purchase again!"
17502,5374,5," Fantastic figure and service! :D"
17503,5375,5," If you like Retro"
17504,5376,5," Really pleased with this item.  The hello Kitty's are large and made from light but good quality plastic. I used them as a Cake Topper and they were really stunning and looked fantastic on the cake. Sold this product by Clearance Crazy who gave a great service. In case you are wondering the heads do not turn as they are moulded in one piece. Great value."
17505,5377,5," I had no idea these existed until this xmas! It comes with 1 mega block brick& one kitty minifigure& and 1 'accessory'... we got the kitty with the chefs hat so her accessory was a cupcake ~adorable!~ and works with Legos& as well.. Will definitely be purchasing more as they're a good price and just too cute! :)"
17506,5378,5," Bought as a gift. Receiver absolutely loved it! Good value for money."
17507,5379,5," This is a brilliant starter set because it gives plenty of props and even a figure to add to your collection and invent fun new stories with. The set comes at a good price& takes about 5 days give or take to arrive. The only thing I would be slightly weary about is when Amazon states it as a free delivery& because it isn't."
17508,5379,5," So cute and our grand-daughter loves them!"
17509,5380,5," Order on time& item as described& good quality"
17510,5381,5," King Leonidas 12 Inch figure from 300I'm more than pleased with the purchase of this action figure.The King Leonidas is extremely detailed and very well built and designed.The accessories that accompany the toy is perfect and complete this figure of very creative way. The cape of the warrior is beautiful& made of rubber.For greats collectors."
17511,5381,5," i bought this for one of mmy mates for his birthday has he collects models. He was very happy with it"
17512,5382,5," The life of the House Party protocol.  Amazing detail and a great piece to have."
17513,5382,5," Gorgeous suit and wish could have seen more of this model in the movie. Proudly on display under my Mark 42 in the cabinet at home."
17514,5382,5," I've got 4 other hot toys iron man figures and I wanted this one for a while. He is fantastic and looks the part. He's not diecast but dnt worry about that it's all on the looks. The price was perfect and he was delivered very fast. VERY HAPPY GEEK."
17515,5382,1," Crap"
17516,5383,5," As a HUGE Maleficent fan and also a 1/6 collector - I had to get her in my collection!She arrived swiftly (via the power of Prime) and in perfect condition& with brown shipper might I add for those collectors who like their figures to come in the HT shipper.The figure itself is great and very pose-able with a lot of articulation points& she is somewhat restricted in the leg section due to the dress so if you are looking to spread the legs quite a bit sideways you will notice that. Her accessories such as the flame are a little fiddly to put on and also her staff with Diaval the raven should you wish to attach him. I wasn't keen on the raven but I did use the flames& these coloured plastic pieces are becoming a big thing with the newer Hot Toys figures and are starting to show up in many different variations and colours.You also had the opportunity to attach an extended train onto her dress - attaching the studs for the extended dress were a pain in the backside as the buttons were not for staying in place and some of the connectors are a little bent. It took quite a bit of perseverance and also needed tweezers to help me squeeze the studs into place.Her headsculpt is nice& it could have been better as the final product photo I don't think looked anything like the prototype that Hot Toys had shown in the first place - straight on I feel the resemblance to Angelina Jolie isn't that strong but side on you can definitely see it!One thing to note is that the clothing can stain the skin on the figure& mine hasn't shown signs of this thankfully as of yet but I have seen some photos on forums.If you are a Maleficent/Disney fan then I would recommend adding her to your 1/6 collection or even if you want an excuse for a decent Angelina Jolie figure then look no further!"
17517,5383,5," Brought as a Christmas present & not given yet but I know they will be really pleased"
17518,5384,5," Living in Japan and just got this fella today. Paid a hell of a lot less than the price here so maybe shop around see if you can get a better deal. The price goes up and up on these figures but so does the quality. Still its a heavy price to pay. If you're used to chucking the big bucks on hot toys figures then my friends& do not hesitate for a second!. This is now the best figure I have in my collection. It's a shoe-in for 1/6th scale figure of the year. I bought the clean DX10 T-800 last year. At the time I thought it was fantastic. I'm still happy with it but with the DX13 the head sculpt is much superior. It's the best 1/6th scale interpretation of Ahhhnolds face out there. Spookily realistic and you get two heads. One from just after evading the police at Cyberdine and the other from when the T-1000 beats the crap out of him near the films end. Hey& if you're interested in buying this guy I'm sure you're aware of all the specs. There's a generous amount of extras not least a liquid form T-1000 to set-up a fight with the main figure. A battered arm of metal fragments below the elbow to switch with the regular arm and a second jacket to highlight the missing arm. It's got that 'wow' factor that I haven't felt so much with recent figures. I believe once this guy is sold-out his value will sky rocket. So& if your hobby is high-end figure collecting get hold of this while you can."
17519,5384,5," Hot toys figure is excellent well worth the money very please"
17520,5385,5," its amazing"
17521,5386,5," I admit it was expensive (compared to poundland Durr) but over all it was really succsessful it's perfect for anyone who collects them or people who like small cute things. I reccomend this"
17522,5387,5," A nice addition to any batman collection."
17523,5387,5," Love it"
17524,5388,4," Many people seem to class this as a boring figure. OK& its no marine or alien& but I am delighted to have a Bishop figure.The figure is mostly excellent& nearly perfect. The sculpt is flawless& I cant find any flaws in it. His jumpsuit& wrist watch and trainers are so well painted and detailed - NECA really are my favourite figure company.The articulation is awkward. NECA seemed focused on hiding his articulation& which helps the sculpt& but limits display possibilities.His accessories are also very good. He comes with a torch& a knife and an interchangeable hand to hold the knife.Why not five stars? The sloppy paint on the head takes away from the PERFECT sculpt. It really is a shame.Sloppy hairline& wonky eyeball and dodgy nostrils! IF you find one with spot-on paint though& this is a five star figure!Comes in Clamshell packaging - Dog Alien and KAne also available in the series."
17525,5388,5," Well  done  neca  for  another  brilliant  aliens  figure bishop is  my favourite android he is  so  different  to  ash  thanks  for  your  hard work  and  can't wait for series 4  set  with  dallas and  two  Ripley s  with  Jonesey the  cat"
17526,5388,5," Very highly detailed figure& well worth the money"
17527,5388,5," Good figure to add to my alien collections"
17528,5389,5," NECA's Planet Of The Apes Series 1 are BRILLIANT.If you have any doubts about them - don't. Buy them in confidence.The packaging is beautiful - clearly inspired by Star Wars Black Series.They come in beautifully designed compact cardboard boxes& and the figure can easily taken out and returned to the packaging.Dr Zauis could be my favourite in the wave...But then again...So is Cornelius and Gorilla Soldier! They're THAT good!The articulation is plentiful but well hidden by the figures design.The sculpt is perfect. I expect no less from NECA. The likeness in the head sculpt is spot on.The accessories included are a scroll and a walking cane.Dr Zauis also comes in the upcoming Series 2 - this figure is based on the good doctors appearance in the second half of the first film (boots& gloves and short jacket) where-as the next figure is based on his appearance in the first half of POTA and his attire in the sequel. Both look completely different& but if you are unsure which to get& I would say buy both!As Troy McClure once said.....I LOVE YOU DOCTOR ZAIUS"
17529,5389,4," NICE ONE ."
17530,5390,5," This is a truly incredible figure! Full marks to the sculptor for this - it's a truly UNCANNY likeness of the legend that is Arnold Schwarzenegger. I've been anticipating this figure for months and months. My expectations were pretty high as I own the Neca quarter scale classic predator& which is a VERY hard act to follow... When I saw the final prototype pictures of Dutch I knew I had to get it pre-ordered! I can happily say that finally& figure in hand it does not disappoint! The sculpt and paint apps are nothing short of exceptional& especially for a figure this size (18| approx) and (relatively) cheap price. The quarter scale Predator line Neca have been making in recent years have really raised the bar in terms of value for money collectibles.The skin is shaded perfectly and has a wet look to it& which really captures the humidity of the jungle. The details on the clothing and accessories is really very nice. There is absolutely no mistaking who the figure is - it is Arnold through and through! There is also a good amount of articulation in the figure& despite it's size although I do offer a word of warning when posing Dutch...I have a few of the Neca quarter scale figures (Alien& Terminator& classic Pred etc.) and have found some stand up a lot better than others.... and some& like the Alien in particular are VERY prone to falling over if you're not super careful with balancing the figure when posing. I've had the Dutch figure two days and already 3 times& in a very 'standard' leg stance the figure has stood fine for a while and then taken a dive randomly hours later... not good if it's on a high shelf or hits a hard surface!Read more â€º"
17531,5390,3," I hate to give this 3 stars because the sculpt and accessories are really top quality but... Neca& when will you ever learn? loose ankle joints combined with heavy figures mean shelf dives. I really wish they would forget the ankle joints as they are so poorly implemented and just go for dynamic poses instead. I know that is not a popular view& but I have had Dutch& Robocop and Predator all fall off a 6.5 foot shelf now and let me tell you& 3 kkilos of heavy plastic figure falling towards you is not something you want to experience more than once in your lifetime. He's a great figure& looks fantastic fighting my classic 18 inch Predator& but for goodness sake make double and tripple sure he's posed stably before you leave him alone. My personal advice would be to leave the  assault rifle off him until he's proven he can stand up& in the hot summer for at least 3 weeks without any shelf diving."
17532,5390,5," Received the item in perfect condition ! Arnold is made with very good quality ! Im loving it alotI recommend this to any Arnold/Predator fan out there."
17533,5390,5," Just brilliant& got all eleven of the 1/4 scale figures shame they didn't do More DUTCH figures as this one is great"
17534,5390,5," the above gentamans post is spot on i agree word for word thank you. i have this delightful figure an love brilliant"
17535,5390,4," An xmas gift but looks amazing and very detailed. Another good price too"
17536,5391,5," I'm very happy&the Ingrid PITT figure is also the Christopher LEE bust a real master piece.The dÃ©tails are excellent and the colors so realist."
17537,5392,5," Perfect"
17538,5393,5," My son was very pleased with this& good quality and very detailed."
17539,5393,5," My son loves it& just wish it would've arrived for Christmas."
17540,5394,5," This is yet another excellent bust from the Star Wars line.  Gentle Giant are probably one of the best Mini Bust producers on the market IMO. Their busts are well made and very detailed."
17541,5394,3," SHAME THAT THE LIGHTSABER IS BLUE BUT THE REST IS OK I GUESS.but I still think the best gentle giant is the 12| boba fett i own."
17542,5395,5," My son has collected Marvel select for a fair few years (1st bought for his 3rd Birthday& he's now 9) he had this today and it looks awesome! Gore looks very real and unlike some of the recent 1's he has had (grey hulk) the figure is actually whole rather than a plastic shell."
17543,5395,5," Very good!"
17544,5395,5," Excellent"
17545,5396,5," My little pony are a odd concept for me& a pony that is completely static& that's right essentially a horse that has no limb movement& its like a mini horse dipped in plastic so it can only move its head to look around& then they took it to the salon& dyed its hair all colors under the sun and made it wear a hat& not the nicest thing to do to as pony& yet they still smile.  My little pony was invented in 1982 by sir David little pony& he also invented my little kettle& my little potato masher and the workd famous my little tin of spaghetti hoops.So basically if you like ponies that are tiny& have very little movement but on the plus side have awesome 80's hair and a tattoo on their bum this is right up your street.It also mentions how friendship is magic& its not if you have a friend like my friend Dave& he stinks of coleslaw& it should say 'friendship is magic unless your friends with Dave who smells of coleslaw."
17546,5396,5," My child loves this and takes it everywhere she goes along with the others she got for Christmas.  They are small and expensive for what you get& but well worth the pleasure she gets from them.  It's far better than taking the large beanie plush ponies out all the time that I end up carrying."
17547,5396,1," Wish I had read the reviews. This is one of the small pony which you can normally buy for around the Â£6/7 mark. Stunned to have received this for Â£13.50. It is going back for a refund (even with the ridiculous return postage charge)"
17548,5396,1," This is so small and so expensive. I could have got 2 for the same price elsewhere. I'm very disappointed and would not have ordered it had a known. I'm sending it back for a refund."
17549,5396,3," It's much smaller than we expected& so very expensive for what it is.  My daughter likes it though which is the main thing."
17550,5396,3," The toy was very small for the price I paid for it. Anyway& my daughter loved it."
17551,5397,3," It's in pieces wouldn't recommend it for children under 5"
17552,5397,5," Grandaughter 4th birthday and went down very well."
17553,5397,5," Great present"
17554,5398,5," I own all the Hot Toys Wolverine figures and this one is the best& the attention to detail is off the hook. It's like looking at Hugh Jackman in the flesh& it's  so realistic it's unbelievable the guys at Hot Toys have pulled out all the stops with this figure. Wolverine comes with 2 outfits& a beautiful samurai sword"
17555,5398,5," Another great figure by Hot Toys& alot of people have said the head sculpt doesn't look like Hugh Jackman but I think it's bang on& awesome figure with some great accessories"
17556,5398,5," Fantastic product. The detailing of both the model and the inter-changeable clothing and claws are astounding. A must buy!"
17557,5398,4," good"
17558,5399,5," my first impressions upon opening this figure were wow wow and more wow comes with 3 head versions lots of interchangeable hands and it has mechanical detail under the armor. the eyes/arc reactor(chest)/hands/feet light up and also the base stand lights up.the amount of detail is jaw dropping and it seems 100% movie accurate if you are thinking of buying this figure you wont be dissapointed on the down side hot toys 1/6 scale figures are expensive."
17559,5399,5," Great item"
17560,5400,4," The figurine has great detail& is perfectly packed& comes with a serial number sticker and theoretically the box under the torso can light up. The last thing didn't work in the one I got& which was price reduced& as a piece seems to be loose inside (sounds like that). Otherwise& it is a magnificent piece of work."
17561,5401,5," Really pleased I brought this tune up kit .the axle assembly replaced a worn out one on an old Tyco car and the tyres fitted on two of my 35 year old aurora cars bringing them back into use."
17562,5402,4," Very cute& however not as large as expected& says product dimensions 3.8 x 12.7 x 15.2 cm this includes length of hair also. Ideal if buying for a collection only.Returned item to order larger."
17563,5402,5," Fast delivery - seems good not passed onto daughter yet as Xmas present but I'm sure she will love it"
17564,5402,5," Fantastic quality nice and bright as pictured delivery ok"
17565,5402,5," Nice toy"
17566,5403,5," This is a super  cheap craft kit& that is so easy to  use.Although it's presented as a children's friendship bracelet set& it's also a great Japanese braiding starter set.You get two 32 slot foam disks that are colour coded on either side to make four intricate woven braids with the minimum of effort. Bear in mind that each kimohimo disk is usually sold for three or four pounds each& and this kit comes with 10 skeins of coloured cotton as well.Great gift for a crafty friend of any age. Ive bought a few sets for a craft group to use. It's straightforward to get everyone set up& and satisfying enough to keep them all busy. The end results are impressive too."
17567,5403,4," Nice item& as described& well packed and delivered within stated time. I found the embroidery flosses supplied were OK but they easily get knotted together when trying to reverse several moves. I found 1mm rattail easier to use.  Also there appears to be a problem with the instructions. Four patterns are shown& but the instructions only describe one pattern& the hearts. I've been in touch with the company& who were unaware of this problem& but have heard I no more. As far as it goes& this is a good way of introducing a useful craft to children& its relaxing to do and fascinating how they work the patterns out. Shame there's only one pattern available."
17568,5403,5," This did exactly what we hoped.  A friend had one and so this was a stocking filler at christmas.  great result"
17569,5403,2," Great idea& Good item. Found it helpful to watch a YouTube video. Recommend once you start your bracelet you finish it before you put it down and you make sure your focused on what your doing because it's extremely easy to get lost or misplace a string along the way.It was picked up by an excited 10 year old who I might add worked out what you do from reading the instructions it was I who used a YouTube video but after putting it down and losing her place when she went to restart it it's not been picked up again - yet."
17570,5403,4," I took other comments into accounty when I purchased this so I think I was on the right level of expectation.This is a good starter kit and I am sure that I will be able to use this to develop further but definitely a great price."
17571,5403,5," What a bargain these are!  I bought this kit for my daughter& but I think I use it more than she does.  Its very relaxing and very easy to use and the two wheels mean you can make 4 different designs."
17572,5403,3," To be fair not the best thing I've ever bought.  Only one pattern included and the colours on the disc not exactly central& hard when you are teaching children to use it."
17573,5404,5," Excellent value for money.  My daughter loves it."
17574,5404,5," My son loves it. Plenty of looms& so never ends."
17575,5404,5," Very good"
17576,5405,3," Plastic containers were very poorly constructed and not practical for little people's hands to open."
17577,5405,5," Love the confetti collection for my craft projects."
17578,5406,5," Really cool idea that's so worth getting. If you're a loom band fan then definetely get it. I think more shops should sell it. :)"
17579,5407,5," Got this for my 3 daughters& whilst the instructions could be more explanatory. We figured it out after a couple of hours and you have to adjust the main board as it is set up different in the box to fit the packaging. Overall my cheapest and best buy as its all they've played with!"
17580,5407,5," daughter wanted this for xmas and could not get it localy. she was really happy to get this and made several items with it already. great item"
17581,5407,4," Iv'e wanted a rainbow loom for ages now& and when it finally came& I was so excited to start using it. It took me a while to grasp the idea but when I got the hang of it i had so much fun. Unfortunately& my sister managed to drop it and one of the lines of pegs snapped. I was cross with her but fixed it with some Blu-Tac as super glue didn't seem to work. I still can use the  loom however when I use the loom& depending on the number of bands on each peg& the lines of pegs seem to lift of of the plates holding the lines of pegs together warping and sometime making the bands come off of the pegs so I have to start again. I'm sure that if my sister hadn't of dropped it& it would've been fine. Also the hook is made of a very thin plastic which warped easily& so now i have to use a crochet hook. But all in all I still enjoy using this product! :)"
17582,5407,4," I got the Royal Loom Band Kit.Many said is was flimsy& broke easily& sharp edges and set up differently to the Rainbow loom.Yes there where a few sharp bits left over from the mould. I just filed them down with a metal nail file. Took two mins. YOU CAN MAKE IT LIKE A RAINBOW LOOM. All you have to do is unclip the supports and rearrange. Then you're free to follow the rainbow loom youtube videos. I wouldn't say it's to flimsy...I assume it's how they're handled. Maybe the Rainbow loom is thinker plastic but for Â£7.50 who can complain when it does what the official looms do? I would recommend it.Can't figure out how to arrange the royal loom into the position of the rainbow loom? Youtube has quite a few videos showing you how...pretty easy to figure out tho with a little bit of common sense."
17583,5407,5," The Royal Look Band Kit is an excellent and artistic time consuming article and both my granddaughters have spent several happy hours producing some wonderful designs and bracelets.  One of them however& found the charms adequate but on the whole they are extremely happy with this product and would recommend it anytime."
17584,5407,5," Great product& my daughter loves this. Got everything you need to make the braclets& instructions may not be the best but that no problem& internet tells you how to make them.Very good price compared to other places. Quick delivery too. Thanks"
17585,5407,5," I ordered this item and it came the very next day I was very impressed with both the item and delivery my daughter loved the looms and I would highly recommend ordering from this site very happy customer"
17586,5407,4," Bought this for my daughter for Xmas- she has played with it non-stop!There is a big craze at school"
17587,5408,5," thanks"
17588,5409,5," Good beads"
17589,5410,5," We bought these to top up our beado collections. These are pretty gems and makes some lovely pictures. They also fit well with the jewelry pack if you have that and make some blingy rings for you little ones. You get 500 in the pack and they are all in separate bags so no sorting needed. Good value beads."
17590,5410,5," Bought to go in my daughters Christmas stocking"
17591,5410,5," Fantastic& gives patience and delicate work to an artistic child. I wouldn't recommend to under 5 though"
17592,5410,5," daughter loves beados and these packs are perfect for keeping her stocked up"
17593,5410,3," Gems get stuck in pens which is very frustrating."
17594,5410,5," Loved by my daughters aged 3 - with adult help!"
17595,5410,5," Excellent was a bit shocked to how small it was"
17596,5410,5," present for granddaughter - she is happy"
17597,5411,5," Nice little pegboard that keeps my son busy for ages. He loves to create all different coloured and patterned creations with this."
17598,5411,5," This was chosen for St Davids day next year.  fits the purpose well arrived by return of post.  Suitably packaged"
17599,5411,5," Bought this Hama pegboard as part of a birthday present&now bringing lots of fun &it came as promised"
17600,5411,5," Arrive on time& was what they had said it was. children love this and are having hours of fun with it."
17601,5411,5," Interestingly shaped peg boards.  Great for dragon topic in holiday club."
17602,5412,5," Worked a treat !"
17603,5413,2," Its header mentions |16 pages| and its description says |16 Pages of Designs for Maxi Beads. Book can be used to overlay the pattern using the transparent square pegboard.|But the board comes without the book of patterns that can be expected from the header and description.Very misleading and disappointing.The board in itself is OK& but I would not have bought it if I had known it would come without the mentioned book."
17604,5413,4," Like the other maxi bead peg boards& this is robust. It is good for creating geometric shapes and I can see we are going to have a large number of multi-coloured coasters around the house! My boys (4 and 5 1/2) love it. The older one is perfectly able to use the midi beads& but likes the fact that he can make something so quickly with this (down side is that you get thorugh beads at a rate of knots)."
17605,5413,5," My kids love Hama beads and the simple shapes are what they always choose. These clear ones are better than the white for two reasons. One& you can put them over an image if you want to use it as a |pattern|. And two& they don't melt as easily under the iron as the white ones do. We have a couple where the pegs are now too short to be used! Silly Mummy."
17606,5413,3," Good for what you want it for but completely missed that it was for only MAXI hama beads& read more carefully"
17607,5414,5," different style&but ok"
17608,5415,5," I purchased specific colours for a school project on Mardi Gras in New Orleans.The children made necklaces with repeating patterns and symmetrical patterned tiles. Everyone had great fun and the results were quite stunning."
17609,5415,5," Gift - bought loads of these - keeps the kids entertained for hours.  Great way to get them of the play stations etc."
17610,5415,5," Hama beads are a favourite in our house and these are a great addition to our collection"
17611,5415,5," No problems arrived promt as expectd"
17612,5415,5," great"
17613,5416,5," I bought this activity case for my 18 month old grand-daughter for Xmas. She absolutely loves it. We have taken the letters away for now to let her concentrate on numbers. It is out every day. 10 out of ten."
17614,5416,5," Happy with this product& my daughter was 20 months old when we started using it (earlier than advised)& she loves the sand drawing board and spends lots of time drawing."
17615,5416,2," Not great"
17616,5417,4," Nice weight to them and a great colour. I will buy more of these!"
17617,5418,5," I make miniature characters out of polymer clay and find Sculpey to be perfect for my needs.  It's very malleable& but not too soft.  It's the 21st century version of plasticine and I just love creating with it.I believe the Hazelnut colour has now been eliminated from their range which is why I bought six of them.  Doh!  It's a perfect bear colour.Sent via a third party& I'd have no qualms about ordering again.  It was sent super speedily.  A perfect transaction via Amazon."
17618,5419,5," My daughter goes through a lot of loom bands. These are great colour and great quality. Would recommend. Better to buy single colour bands than mixed bags."
17619,5419,1," These bands were just as pictured (lime green in colour). However& they are very thin and make flimsy& cheap-looking bracelets. You can only use these to make easy bracelets such as the fishtail bracelet. They are definitely not suitable for mid-level to advanced bracelets as they break very easily. Even if you are only using this for a fishtail& I would recommend you use better quality bands for your other colours otherwise the whole bracelet looks a bit tacky. A few of the bands were already broken when the packet arrived."
17620,5419,5," good price & right time delivery& the band is in nice quality no odor I love it & will buy again from the seller"
17621,5419,5," I have to say& these were the best quality bands that I have bought from Amazon. I have bought thousands from them off different companies. These are strong and are cut properly& with no thinner v bit in the middle of it. If you have made loom bracelets you will know what I mean. They were delivered in good time. I would definitely buy more from this company."
17622,5419,3," When I ordered these bands& I was expecting the bands to be a normal colour although when the bands arrived the brand was 'Loom Bands' which did not match the photo description. Also the band colours were luminous meaning that the green was a very light green and I also ordered some yellow bands from the same company which were and luminous yellow.ðŸ’ª"
17623,5419,3," These are ok& but definitely not great. After about a week of wearing the bracelet that has been made& the bands begin to crumble and end up breaking. This has also happened with bands that haven't been worn& so it isn't a stretching issue. They're ok if you want to practice& but if you want something long-lasting& these aren't for you."
17624,5419,5," Lovely bright colour as shown in the advert.Daughter loves both the colour and quality of these bands it is definitely worth paying that little extra for them.All my daughters friends ask where she got them and want her to make them a bracelet from them.Definitely recommend this product and seller."
17625,5419,5," Obviously not official& but know that from the price. However these are very good and strong. Have used for quite complex bracelets with a lot of tension and have not had a problem. Colours are great. Bought a few from different suppliers and all turned up quickly and are same quality."
17626,5420,5," Received the crystal chips this morning love them thank you."
17627,5420,4," Great gem stones & although the jade chips came a bit large"
17628,5420,5," ALL NEARLY USED WILL HAVE TO BUY MORE"
17629,5420,4," Lovely depth of colours"
17630,5421,4," First time I have used the 4m Crackle Beads and these ones and look good in the braclets I have made."
17631,5421,5," lovely beads& I will buy these again in the future. Daughter loved them& so has actually claimed them as hers."
17632,5421,5," These are great spacer beads"
17633,5421,5," Happy with these"
17634,5421,5," Fab as always :)"
17635,5422,5," My daughters have enjoyed making hair bands with this lovely kit. 'Crafting' if that is even the correct term is pretty big in our house and although you can acquire many of the pieces you get here from various craft shops this& as a starter set is really good. It certainly lets the imagination loose and my daughters have hair bands of their own creation now. That unique element is something you can't get from wider commercial products and we like the fact that the girls have sat down& created their own hair bands and used the fruits of their labour. That is a nice thing. I have to give 5 stars because the smiles from two of my daughters (the ones old enough to wear hair bands) are so wide wearing their own hand-made hair bands (ok mums hands were pretty instrumental) speaks for itself."
17636,5422,5," This was a great activity for my 8 and 10 year old"
17637,5422,5," My nieces (6 and 4 years old) are very creative and love making things and absolutely loved making this set. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has creative children who love making things as it's a really sweet set. The picture on the box is a bit misleading as it looks like you are making firm head bands i.e. the type with a plastic band when you are not as you are making soft headband style hair bands.  You get enough elastic bands to make 8 hair bands but these are easily duplicated with other elastic hair bands and so you can get more than 8 hair bands out of the set if you wish.  To make the hair bands you simply plait the supplied stretchy fabric together and thread on the flowers with bead centers as you go.  The finished product is really nice but the ends are a little messy looking however this is not a problem if they are going underneath your hair.  My nieces really enjoyed making these last week and if done carefully you can dismantle the hair bands and make new designs so the set seems to have a good bit of longevity in it.  A really nice creative and good fun set."
17638,5422,5," The Galt Brilliant Hair Band set is a fantastic gift for any creative girl& or girls. It allowed three little girls& aged 5&6& and 7& to have great fun together. They all pitched in to create some lovely hair bands& and the finished products did not look like a typical craft item made by a child. Instead& they looked like something you might buy in a shop& really lovely quality for a craft kit.The box contains two bags of flowers& some larger than the others. It also contains& a bag of bright coloured fabric strips which have a great stretchy feel to them. Also included are beads and eight strong elastic bands. There is no need for glue to be used& so this is a mess-free craft kit! Brilliant!In terms of difficulty& all that are required in terms of skills are the ability to thread and plait. Everything is easily manageable for a child of around six and up.Overall& I would highly recommend this set. It is a lovely little craft kit for a child on their own& or as a group activity between friends or siblings."
17639,5422,4," Simple to make set of stretchy headbands. They're not rigid bands and you need to tie them to keep them in place. They don't tie too neatly if you're leaving the ends on show but are fine if you can hide them under longer hair. There are 8 elastic hair bands& 30 fabric strips (assorted sizes)& 25 flowers and 25 beads inside the box. To make the bands you simply plait the fabric strips& add beads and flowers to your own design then attached the finished plait to the band. Easy to undo and start again. I can see most little girls having fun with this. Brilliant Hair Bands has a 6+ safety recommendation. Nice little bit of fun and I'm happy to recommend."
17640,5422,4," This sweet little set comes in a nice neat cardboard box which doubles up as a little carry case with a handle. Inside is everything you need to make 8 cute stretchy hairbands& including fabric to plait& beads and flowers to thread through& and elastic to tie the finished product onto and use as a band.The materials are good quality& the flower shapes are pretty and the colours of the fabric range from bright to pastel& so there's a really nice range. The fact that you can design your own headband and use whatever colours& positionings of beads etc that you wish makes it a nice creative activity and means that everyone ends up with something special and individual to them to wear afterwards.It's a really nice& simple crafting activity with no mess& no glue or complicated actions. The finished products look pretty good& although the place where they tie at the bottom is a bit messy& so it's best to try and keep it covered by hair! A lovely activity to fill a couple of hours on a rainy afternoon."
17641,5423,4," This box contains 53 pieces in total -board included as per box picture. Does not contain pen and magnetic stickers as per Amazon's description. The product is well made and the back of the board can be used for writing with a whiteboard pen (to be bought separately). Small-case letters and numbers can be added as they are sold separately. I would have given 5 stars if the description was correct."
17642,5423,5," Item as descibed"
17643,5424,5," Originally I expected these beads to be bigger although this was my own schoolboy error for not checking the size against a ruler (please check if you are new like me!) Subsequently there seemed less of them than I had thought but for 100 they work out good value for money. I am very impressed with how they look and the delivery was very fast (dispatched same day and received 2 days later) 5 stars!"
17644,5424,5," Good products"
17645,5425,5," Yep& it's a peg board! Does what it should. Arrived on time. Great for making Minecraft Steves!"
17646,5426,5," Bought as a gift for a 6 year old and it was her favourite present! Very happy"
17647,5426,5," Our grand-daughter loved this. She liked being able to decorate the box in which she would keep the bracelets that she made from the Sambro Frozen Create Your Own Bracelets and Bead Set."
17648,5426,5," Fabulous gift for frozen fan"
17649,5426,5," Bought 2 of these as Christmas Gifts - they look great and I am sure a lot of fun will be had making them up."
17650,5426,5," My boyfriends niece LOVED this ! Lovely gift and good value for money ! Very happy !"
17651,5426,5," Super gift for my niece.... she loved making the box sparkle"
17652,5426,5," Bought as a present for a 6 year old girl - she loved it"
17653,5426,4," As described - bit hard for a child to do the sticking"
17654,5427,5," All very good& Thank You very much"
17655,5428,5," This product was exactly as described and in good condition. Purchased for crafts and jewelry making. Had to consider bead size."
17656,5428,4," Good quality beads& nice colours& although they are a bit more expensive than similar alternatives that one could find on the hightstreet or at local markets."
17657,5428,5," The picture does not do these beads justice. They look much more expensive and are more variegated in colour and within each bead. Lovely for any kind of jewellery. I am sure I will order more and different sizes. Do not forget to get your tape measure out to check this is correct size for you."
17658,5428,5," I like these beads they are colourfull and interesting and i would recommend these beads to any one. they are great"
17659,5428,1," the color that shines is just paint on the outside& it gets pealed off and your lift with a s***y looking bead after 2 days.i repeaaat ----  its not glass& its s*** plastic covered with crackle glass paint!!!but hey what do you expect for this price to be honest :(arrived in good time to be fair"
17660,5428,2," I found a number of beads stuck together and when I tried to prise them apart they broke!  Generally I found the beads to be poor quality.  I was very disappointed as all the other beads I have bought on Amazon have been really good."
17661,5428,5," Great items for early filler for Christmas stockings my daughter will love them and make me interesting surprises which i will wear with pride"
17662,5428,5," i will be making necklaces in the coming months not had a chance yet i like these so pretty i will be buying more as the are such good value."
17663,5429,5," My 2 1/2 year old is completely snooker loopy(doesn't seem to mind that this is actually a pool table). I brought this table for him as it is a great size for him (all the others seem to be atleast 3ft and too high for him).It was only delivered today but form the moment he saw the box he went mad jumping up and down an was so excited I had to let him have it straight away.So far we are not disappointed& it appears to be of reasonable build and quite sturdy& as do the accessories that come with it.  He has been playing on it for 2 hours solid now and he loves it!Some people have commented about the size of the holes to get the balls out but we are not having any problems as the balls seem to roll down to the centre when pocketed and he is having no problem at all getting his chubby little hands in to retrieve them (I've also tried and I can manage with ease).Well priced& packed and delivered quickly.We recommend this table& it's fab!"
17664,5429,2," So much about this is good.....the size is great...not too big but big enough to play properly. Cues and balls are good quality and the brush is a nice touch.However& the downside is the build quality. We had to tighten a screw underneath when we opened it for the first time and last week the whole plastic pocket system on one side has fallen off. This was connected to the playing surface so it is now half a centimere under the height of the cushions....not good.Almost a great product for the price but may not last you long if our build quality is typical of their other tables."
17665,5429,5," The table is ideal for my 8 year old nephew. He had hours of fun with it. Exellent value for money a good quality product."
17666,5429,4," not the best quality& cheap wood& not completely flat etc. but the kids absolutely love it. i've seen other well known brands versions i.e. riley& and this one is sturdier and better."
17667,5429,5," A big hit with my two boys over christmas& played with lots.  Can't complain about the quality or parts considering the price paid& good value& would recommend."
17668,5429,5," Really great for a christmas present& very hard to give away after having a play myself! Very good quality and fun to play with."
17669,5429,1," This table is not good. The pockets are far too small and difficult to get the balls into. There are far better table top pool tables on the market that actually give enjoyment& this one just frustrates all who play on it."
17670,5429,3," not very good when i took it out the box there was screws lying in the bag but not enough screws to fill the holes& it was very shodily made the ballrunner was hanging off. a bad buy!"
17671,5430,5," Sent to my great granddaughter (5th Birthday) and she sent me a pic of her first effort which was very good.Obviously Mum did the 'ironing'. Consulted reviews before purchasing and would definitely recommend."
17672,5430,5," My nephew loved his sisters beads& but they were too small and frustrating for him& these are just a bit bigger and he finds them perfect."
17673,5431,5," Great! Wrapped well"
17674,5431,4," Great"
17675,5432,5," good"
17676,5433,5," My grandaughters loved these."
17677,5434,5," Just brings out the creativity in a 9 yr old& and the fact that she can actually wear her own creations - priceless.Even I got a lovely bracelet. Worth the buy. Highly recommended."
17678,5434,3," Bought for my 10 year old daughter but think it would be more suited to younger girls. Love Galt products normally but was disappointed by this item. Charms a bit babyish and cheap looking& overall not a great quality item."
17679,5434,5," Bought this for my 6 year old god-daughter and she couldn't wait to open it and start making bracelets. She has enjoyed making them for her friends in school too& the girls are very impressed."
17680,5434,4," I have purchased this for my granddaughter for Christmas& as she loves arts and crafts.  Delivery was good. But will have to wait for Christmas."
17681,5434,1," Very bad quality. I bought this for my niece's 7 birthday& I think she was too young for that.Everything looks so cheap... Disappointed."
17682,5434,3," Some clips were broken when it turned up. Another has broken already. Our daughter did love making them though so that made it worth while."
17683,5434,5," I bought this for my niece for Christmas she loves to make thing's so I thought this would be ideal for her. Just right a mount of charms in the box. You do not want to many because the child might get bored with it and then you would have loads of charms every where. If your child loves it then you can buy more charms. I would highly recommend to everybody."
17684,5434,5," I bought this as a birthday present for my soon to be 7 year old granddaughter so it hasn't been given as yet. However& she is a very girlie girl so I'm sure she will love making bracelets for herself and her friends. I also bought the Melissa and Doug 'Decorate your own Jewellery Box' so she will have somewhere to keep her creations."
17685,5435,5," after many attempts to find real bells& i bought these. Good selection of sizes& great shiny colours and great jingle& especially the larger ones. Overall& really happy with them!"
17686,5435,5," Purchased by my 5 year old son - who is very satisfied.  A mix of bells with different tones from high pitched to medium pitched.  Some were sewn onto a Christmas jumper for a nativity play& and he loved shaking his jumper and hearing the jingles."
17687,5435,5," Lovely differing sounds& used to make and enhance homemade items to support daughter in her fundraising efforts for a trip of a lifetime"
17688,5435,5," A really nice little set of bells good enough for even Santa's sleigh! Some of these bells are really tiny so if you were looking for a really big noise then perhaps these are not for you. I am making up a collection of all sizes so these are perfect for what I am looking for and they have a nice jingle to them. A good price and arrived fairly quickly even though I ordered two bags and only got one but the supplier was quick off the mark and sorted my problem out straight away."
17689,5435,1," The picture of these bells and the description indicated a selection of different sizes and influenced my purchase.  The bells I have received are all the SAME SIZE.Since the different sounds made by different sized bells is a significant part of my project I am therefore not best pleased with the delivery."
17690,5435,4," I actually bought these for my cat to knock about the floor as she loves things that jingle. They have served the purpose. The smallest ones are too small for this but not everyone wants them for their cat!"
17691,5435,4," Haven't used all of them yet& bought for craft projects with my young 4yr old neighbour.  I think we will all get Christmas Cards with bells on!"
17692,5435,5," Lovely little bells& worked perfectly for my craft project. Great sound and variation of sizes. Exciting when they jingled upon arrival& too."
17693,5436,5," I think it is just as good as all of the other animal shape pegboards.I have already made one and had it ironed and I will do more of them.Hope that HAMA will put on the market other animals to make from the pegs .How about a fish shaped one?"
17694,5436,5," Love it. Kids enjoy playing with the beads and I love frogs"
17695,5436,5," Perfect"
17696,5437,4," Nice& holes in wooden beads could be cleaner& threading laces get caught on rough bits inside bead."
17697,5437,5," Value for money!"
17698,5438,5," Good product"
17699,5438,5," Pleased"
17700,5439,5," it came in a box& very good quality board and bands. this is a good product and for the people who are saying it is cheap and nast think about it& it is Â£4.25 !!!!!"
17701,5439,5," Good value pack& which seems to be of good quality. No unexpected breakages and there are some great colour choices!"
17702,5439,5," Good quality& fast delivery.But it was cheaper before."
17703,5439,5," Fast delivery& cheap price& better than expected!"
17704,5440,5," Fantastic"
17705,5441,5," My kids are mad on Loom bands. I've been buying them in poundshops but they seem to have gone out of stock now so I was pleased to find this item at an excellent price on Amazon.My kids love the colours and the stripes in these ones.As a parent& I would probably give them 2 stars because I'm sick of finding them in every room of my house and the bracelets in the kids beds etc but then I would definitely give them 5 stars for a way of keeping the kids happy and quiet while they sit making them!"
17706,5441,1," Hi& the picture shows nice colours in pink& yellow and purple& but beware when my item arrived if had dark green& red and blue& not at all like the picture& when I contacted company they wanted me to send them back (it would cost more that I actually paid for them to do that)& total waste of time"
17707,5441,5," The UK and maybe the world has gone Loom Band mad and its not just the young as I am addicted to making them and cannot stop ordering the packs.  Great value."
17708,5441,5," Lovely pastel colours..strong and fit for purpose. Grandkids loved these will use again for delivery promptness and packaging and wuality."
17709,5441,5," Item as seen& very reasonable price."
17710,5441,5," very pleased with order thank you"
17711,5442,5," My daughter loves to paint- and I am keen to encourage her. I am therefore always on the look out for new ideas and projects for her. As she also loves dinosaurs I knew she would absolutely love this kit- especially as we have had other Melissa and Doug kits which she has enjoyed. In this kit you get two different model dinosaurs& a paint brush and different coloured paints. I especially like that the dinosaur models are very robust and well made- and have coped very well when they have been accidentally dropped by our three year old with no damage despite being dropped from a couple of feet from her table onto our laminate floor.The other thing I really like about this kit is that there is plenty of paint- as young children do tend to be a little heavy handed with materials this is always a plus. This is a really well kit that my daughter has loved so much so that we brought a second set-  she now has a collection of 4 beautifully painted dinosaurs which she is very proud of."
17712,5442,4," Bought this for a 7 year old boy who loves animals. Purchased Melissa"
17713,5442,5," Little dino to paint with paints included.  Good size& easy to paint and cute figure to end with.  Suits an older child as a bit fiddly for a toddler."
17714,5442,4," Nice little present and good for younger children as the parts to paint are already made& my kids are impatient so this works well."
17715,5442,5," Not opened yet as it's an Xmas present but looks great& that good I bought another. Would recommend"
17716,5442,5," Nice little set& purchased for my art mad dinosaur mad daughter and she loved it would buy again"
17717,5443,5," Bought as a gift for a 4yr old girl who had previously learned how to make loom bands& can not comment on quality of bands but looks good"
17718,5443,4," The young girl who received them loved them and has not stopped using them. Will probably have to buy more at some point as there aren't many in the set"
17719,5443,5," Exactly what I was looking for& reasonably priced and my neice was delighted to have the Hello Kitty charms."
17720,5443,5," Purchased as a party bag present for my daughters 6th birthday party ... everyone was delighted with!"
17721,5443,4," Well don't these little things get every where& I've found them in crevices I never knew existed"
17722,5443,5," My daughter is hello kitty mad and loved these but they only come with 5 S hooks..."
17723,5443,4," If you love hello kitty and loom bands then you will love this."
17724,5443,5," Love it!Arrived quickly& good price"
17725,5444,4," good value"
17726,5445,4," They are as described - all good - no issues."
17727,5445,4," As stated thanks"
17728,5446,5," it was a present child loved it"
17729,5447,5," I'd seen this in adverts on the television and wanted it for Christmas. It turned out as my aunt and my little project over the holiday. It did take a while to complete (3 or 4 days) but you could see it getting better as you went along. There were enough pins and sequins but by the end my fingers were sore. The instructions are very easy to follow and it looks beautiful when it's done. I felt really proud of it."
17730,5447,5," My daughter bought this product. She loved doing this& it is now up in our dining room. She is 12 years old. It is now giving everyone the benefit of her work. I would definately recommend this product."
17731,5447,5," My 13 year old daughter got this for her birthday and she loved doing this. It now sits proudly on the wall in our dining room. It changes colour from different angles. Would definately recommend this. It gives hours of pleasure and the end product is amazing. My daughter loves the fact that it is on the wall for everyone to see. We are delighted with the sequin art. It is giving us all a lot of pleasure and it's special because our daughter made this for us."
17732,5447,5," My daughter loves these sequin art pictures& she has now completed 5 of them.  Easy to do but still challenging and look very pretty on bedroom wall."
17733,5447,5," Our eight year old granddaughter pestered for this& and on Christmas day opened it along with so many other toys& however came back to it& and to our surprise worked at it for hours& which was a amazing as it demands good dexterity and patience. She did not complete it on the day& only did perhaps a quarter of it& but she loved it& very surprising& considering the array of electrical gadgetry she and my grandson were surrounded by. Took it home to complete& a good present."
17734,5447,5," Highly recommended - 9 year old daughter loves it! Hours of entertainment for little cost. Will buy for all her friends birthdays!"
17735,5447,5," I bought this for my 10 yr old daughter & she'd received the dog sequin art  for her birthday and now she can't get enough of them& in fact we end up doing it together!She now wants to go through the whole collection - a great boredom reliever. This is much different to Junior sequin art ( where the coloured pins are highlighted for you ) so it ended up beinga great puzzle too. Would  definitely recommend."
17736,5447,5," These are just the best gifts for kids who like crafts. My 9"
17737,5448,5," Teacher very pleased with this product"
17738,5449,5," Bought this Hama pegboard as part of a birthday present&now bringing lots of fun &it came as promised"
17739,5449,5," Great"
17740,5450,5," As expected& bairn was happy and that's the aim."
17741,5450,5," Christmas gift."
17742,5451,4," I originally bought this to re-string a shop bought elasticated bead bracelet which had become 'baggy/loose' with wear. The bracelet is now as good as new and my daughters and I are now making bracelets to sell at school with the cord.The cord is easy to use as it is stiff enough to thread directly into beads. The only minor problem I have is tying it off& because the cord is so slippery if you tie a reef knot it comes undone as soon as any tension is applied. However I have been tying off with 2 double knots and that is secure and not too obvious as the cord is clear."
17743,5451,4," This elastic isn't as stretchy as I was expecting but it does seem quite strong. I managed to tie very tight knots with it for bracelet-making."
17744,5451,5," This served the purpose and was good to use in our jewelry making session. Strong enough not to break for what we needed."
17745,5451,3," Used for stringing beads for braclets etc. I ordered it when I accidentally cut the  elastic when removing the price tag. Good stuff& but it is not a constant thickness throughout the reel."
17746,5451,5," exactly what I want for my beading and jewellery makingstrong stretchy and easy to use. and a great price too."
17747,5451,5," Have already created a few bracelets.  Thank you for this.  Will be ordering again soon."
17748,5451,5," Excellent product & very durable just what I needed for my jewellery making&  thanks."
17749,5452,5," This provided hours of fun for my 8years old grand daughter& and lookedlovely when it was finished. I definitely recommend this toy.P.J.Norton"
17750,5452,5," I bought this for my 8 year old daughter who is horse mad. Very easy to do as and very soothing. It comes with a printed flock style canvas which had dots to place the sequins on. The paper pattern has numbered dots which tell you where to put each colour and the beads. She has been doing it for a month now at weekends and cant wait to finish it so she can hang it on the wall. Was a great Easter present and worth every penny."
17751,5452,4," Grandparents bought my 10 year and 8 year old daughters these for Xmas.They have wanted them for a while after seeing them advertised on telly and I must admit they're not disappointed.They have spent many a rainy day working on these.They're definitely not a one day hit as they have loads left to do until they've finished."
17752,5452,5," Really lovely item& easy to assemble but hurts your fingers if you try to assemble too quickly so take your time!!  Picture really lovely when assembled.  Easy to order& well packaged& arrived on time and in excellent condition."
17753,5452,5," Bought as a gift for a 9 year old. She was thrilled with it. It will take her some time to complete but that was the reason for buying. Arrived very quickly."
17754,5452,4," Ordered as a Xmas present for grand-daughter (11 yrs).  Arrived well before deadline.  Apparently likes these - when in the mood. No complaint so far."
17755,5453,5," I ordered these for some Christmas crackers I am making& although the seller says some of them don't make a sound all of the ones I've used so far have. Good value for money and delivered quickly."
17756,5453,5," Although smaller than I thought these small golden jingle bells are of very good quality& &their colour is bright and shiny and they have a distinctive jingle. Would recommend ."
17757,5453,5," These are just the job for the crafting I am doing as I needed some MINI size bells. Great price and I also bought the silver pack and multi colour pack :)"
17758,5453,4," These pretty little bells arrived earlier than expected and will be perfect my project ( reindeer collars ). I am more than happy with them so it may be petty to mention that there are only 48!"
17759,5453,5," Two bags of the great Gold Tone Jingle Bells and I'm a happy gal!  They're great& not tacky rubbish - will definitely buy more from here.Definitely recommended to all crafters and Court Jesters!"
17760,5453,5," These are very sweet and make a lovely tinkly sound& they were really good value and the seller (K2-accessories) got them to me very quickly.  I was lucky too& as I got 54 in my pack!"
17761,5453,5," Loved these for craft although very small not ideal for small children"
17762,5453,1," I have just received these bells i use the word bells firstly they were silver not gold&they are tiny and of coarse they DONT jingle to cheap looking to use and to cheap to send back its time to bite the bullet and move on"
17763,5454,4," Very happy"
17764,5455,5," Exactly what I was looking for& really brought my charms together. they look so pretty had lots of fun making them also."
17765,5455,5," I really like these beads& they are good for jewellery making and they look good quality."
17766,5456,4," Bought as a gift& slightly smaller than I expected but the 10 year old I bought it for loved it."
17767,5457,5," Bought as a Christmas present for my 6 yr old. Very pleased with this. Makes very large pictures. Great gift."
17768,5458,5," I bought this board after discovering snowflake designs on Pinterest and have been using it to make a wide variety of snowflakes to hang in my kitchen window& really sturdy board that will get lots of use."
17769,5458,5," Arrived well packed and quickly. My Grandson loves using Hama beads it is a great way to get the kids away from the games machines"
17770,5458,5," Had been after a hex shape for ages. What you see if what you get."
17771,5458,5," Very happy with the speedy delivery price and product."

17773,5459,5," Bought this for my 8 year old granddaughter& it was her first sequin art and she loved it. She became totally engrossed in it...allowed for quiet time on Boxing Day!"
17774,5460,5," They arrived very quickly.  Very pretty and my granddaughter aged 3 loved them and wore them straight away.  Nice colours and easy for her to put on and take off.  Also easy to put onto her doll."
17775,5460,4," Girls had them as party favours& 5 girls and 5 bracelets& unfortunately one snagged when I handed it over and broke immediately so perhaps for slightly older girls than can handle them more carefully (these were 4 y old). Lovely bracelets otherwise."

17778,5460,1," when it did not turn up I had to e-mail to find out if it was sent& then it was sent again& then the postman turned up with a card asking if I would pay extra postage as it had not been done!!!!!! I said no and waited for the second lot to come&as I had paid postage when ordered&and it was not worth the postage  tat !!!"
17779,5460,5," These are so pretty and are well made. They are for the smaller wrist though as the rubber band is fairly small. They do stretch a bit& but are uncomfortable due to the thin rubber.I brought these for 2x6 year olds (too small) and 3x4 year olds (fitted lovely)"
17780,5460,5," Very cute little bracelets.Bought them for my grand daughter who is 2. They will be fine as they are small but will fit a bigger child too as they are elasticated.Fast delivery.Thankyou."
17781,5460,4," Bought these to put in party bags for the little girls invited to my sons birthday party. Think they went down  well. Perfect size for about 4 or 5 year old. Pleased with them& and arrived in good time."
17782,5461,5," Help my little girl with her letters"

17786,5463,5," Just as expected. Lots of beads in lots of different colours."
17787,5464,5," This was bought for my 4 year old as a birthday present. She and her 5 year old sister have had endless fun making brackets and necklaces. Excellent product"
17788,5464,5," Not opened yet as was bought for Christmas but looks good and am sure my little girl will love it."
17789,5464,5," Bought for my granddaughter she is a year younger than recommended age& but she loves it"

17793,5465,1," Arrived this morning& not in English& not much use as I don't speak French or Dutch neither does my daughter& very disappointed."
17794,5465,5," Fantastic Product& Highly Recommended"
17795,5465,3," Not as good as the rival aqua beads brand. My daughter loves to make them but they break really easily."

17800,5466,5," Fantastic set of dice& really well made and the colours are gorgeous. These are now my main set for playing and DMing. Super fast delivery too& arrived way before the expected date! Extremely happy!"
17801,5467,4," I could be doing the same thing twice here as lost previous review.  Clever little game (fits in a pocket).  Have played this game with 5 people but would be good for much larger numbers of players."
17802,5467,5," This game is a must. Since I have been introduced it on Christmas Day& me and my husband have gone on to introduce it to more people who like ourselves have purchased. Absolutely no skill needed. Exchange the green counters for 20p's ensure you have at least 6 of you playing and you have the potential to win Â£3.60 each round - the kids love it!"
17803,5467,4," We played this a 9 years old& a thirty year old a forty year old and two sixty year olds and had a great time anticipating who might win - because you don't know until the final dice has been thrown.  So we bought six more sets for the rest of the family."
17804,5467,5," Great game for playing with all ages& good. after dinner entertainment . Even played with 3 yr old grandchild who loved it."
17805,5467,5," I like this game! Simple rules and fun to play with small children.Packaging is minimalist& fits in every pocket."
17806,5467,5," This is a great game for all ages& so simple yet interesting.If you want you can always play with more counters"

17808,5469,5," These perfectly fit Yugioh cards without obscuring any of the design."
17809,5470,5," Overview: These are a set of cubes which show a different image on each face. The aim of these are for the children to roll them and put them in order to make a sequence ready for a story. The child is then to use their imagination to create a story based on those characters& props and themes.One of the newest additions to the Rorys story cube collection. Some of the images include: moomin characters e.g. papa& frying pan& woods& castle& jam& fire& a leaf& nail& sun etc.Uses: These are a fantastic resource to use in the classroom or at home. They come in a variety of styles which will suit different topics and children's interests. In the classroom they can be used individually with children or they could be used as a whole group with each child having a different image to add to the whole class story (e.g. sit in a circle and try to add a sequence to the running story). At home& or in the car journey they can be used to keep children amused and stimulated throughout.They are:> Compact& lightweight and durable.> Come in a lovely presentation box to keep them safe!> Have a different image on each face e.g a character& prop or themes/ideas.> Have a variety of themes to choose from e.g. other imagination ones and a new batman one has just been released.Would highly recommend to anyone who has children or works with them! They are fab!!!! Many hours of enjoymentActivity ideas:> Could be used to help develop EAL learners language recall. This may include rolling a dice and the children in the small EAL group need to say the key word as quick as possible. The first child to say it wins a point.Read more â€º"

17811,5470,5," Cute graphics - great addition to Story Cubes"
17812,5471,5," If you're not already a fan of Rory's Story Cubes& prepare to be converted! Such a simple idea& but beautifully executed.The dice are nicely heavy in the hand: children really want to roll them. The storage box is also superb quality: you know that it'll last you for a long time.I've used these dice (and the other two sets available) in the classroom to inspire story telling and with my own children to occupy them on journeys. Sets can be shared across a class& with each group/table having different ones& or use a visualiser to show the same dice to the whole class. They will each interpret the pictures in their own way. Simply superb for shared writing or poetry. Think of something for each letter of the alphabet that fits the rolled image(s) or tell a story as a random die is chosen and rolled& or add another item to the list that gets ever longer ...Lovely dice& with countless uses :-)"
17813,5471,5," As is usually the case with games& the most simple ideas are often the best. How much easier to play could a game be than picking up a handful of 'story cube' dice throwing them on the table and then& letting your imagination be guided by the combination of random images your throw has provided& either writing or telling a story beginning with 'Once Upon A Time'?Rory's Story Cubes are not only educational& fun& and challenging they are perfect for parties when late in the hour the dancing has ceased and people are chatting around a table with a glass of wine. Writing clubs will also find them an invaluable tool for inspiring great works from members at workshops and the best thing about them is that there are millions of possible combinations so no two workshops will ever be the same!The cubes come in a really tough little box with a magnetic fastener (nice touch!). They are of good quality manufacture and even repeated use is unlikely to cause any of the print to come off unlike many other cheap dice games.Add to the fun the fact that other 'themed' sets ('Actions'"
17814,5471,5," I brought this product for my 6 year old son because he is a lazy reader! Very capable but lazy! I also brought the other ranges. When they arrived we sat down as a family and played lots of story telling with them - It was hilarious and even my 5 year old girl loved it. It really opened up his imagination! So much so that recently his story was shortlisted to receive an award and our local Festival of Literature! He didnt win but we keep playing with the cubes!!! Definate buy for all children!"

17816,5471,4," Bought this for my 10yr old son"
17817,5471,4," These story cubes were purchased for my girlfriends birthday. It is fun to play as instructed& or create your own rules.  This game can be easily modified to be fun for larger social groups at home& on the train& or in a pub.  The quality of the cubes themselves is extremely high.  The cubes are made of a high density plastic resin that are solid and feel well balanced.  The pictures on the cubes are stamped in the plastic rather than painted on so they feel well made.  The packaging is also really well designed& the case is small& very little wasted material and the magnetic clasp keeps the lid closed tightly enough not to worry about it opening up in your bag.Overall& these game cubes are really fun& are made very well and they are relatively inexpensive.  I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a social/verbal game to play."
17818,5472,5," If im honest I bought this set over 2 years ago but I still love these dice.Paint hasn't chipped at all& I love the striking colour and design.It will always have a place in my dice bag."
17819,5473,5," recently i was most pleased to receive this red poly dice set on time and in perfect condition.  the dice roll successfully almost every time& and unlike inferior brands& almost never fly up into the air and stick to the ceiling. also a number is usually visible on the dice by which you can determine the result of the rolling.  alas no 7& 11 or 23 sided dice were included in the pack so my plan to invent pandimensional hyper-ludo will have to be but on hold for the time being.  still that is a small price to pay when faced with such nice shiny red dice."
17820,5473,5," First impressions: the size of these die is perfect& they have a good weight and feel in the hand& and the numbers are easily legible even for those of us who have ordered our first reading glasses. The blue you get is the same blue as in the photo.I haven't tried to run over them with any large vehicle& subjected them to stress tests& or put them through the washing machine but they seem pretty durable to me. The numerals are carved in and well-painted as I haven't been able to scratch any paint off.Hope this info helps."
17821,5473,3," no D6 with this set& but extras of others so it balances out - someone probably wants to have a look at the little old lady who's doing the packing and make sure she's ok though."
17822,5473,5," Sorry I couldn't resist the bad pun!For d20 based games such as d"
17823,5473,3," I chose to buy this set of dice specifically due to the way the D4 was depicted in the picture as i did not like the way the other D4s were layed out. Just recieving the parcel today and the D4 is layed out the way i do not like not the way it was in the picture... This is the only complaint i have everything else was good& the delivery came on the earliest date that was estimated and the die are in good condition. Also recieved a 5% off card for Forlon Hope Games which is nice.3 out of 5 stars and would have been 5 if the picture showed me what i was actually going to get which it still doesn't. However there is a dofferent picture on the My orders list to what the picture discription is. This is me picking at smaller details however it is something that bothers me. Hopefully the seller sees this and changes the picture. Thank you for a good product and delivery"
17824,5473,4," These dice come in very good condition and seem& (I haven't gamed with them yet)& to have a decently even distribution when it comes to rolling them. It is only a minor quibble& but some of the numbers on the dice are not fully filled in& not so much that they can't be read& they are very legible. They are exceptionally good value for what you get.Some of the corners are relatively sharp (such as on the D6 and D4)& so the dice come to a stop fairly quickly when rolled& meaning that you're not waiting for a couple of seconds for the dice to stop moving when you want to get on with your game& this also means that they are less likely to give biased results. However some dice& like the D10s have particularly rounded edges& so I'll have to see how they distribute results.On the whole they seem to be very good. I look forward to using them in future.EDIT: I've had these dice for less than two hours and the paint has already started to chip off the D4. Not impressed by that."
17825,5473,5," |I ordered 5 cup's and 6 die sets as presents for my role-playing group. One yellow D4 was smudged but the company replaced the whole yellow set& which was good of them.

17828,5474,3," N of really giant....thought it was going to be bigger& about twice the size of a normal board game but for the price it is still good buy & very light plastic so best to stick it to cardboard all In all  a larger than normal set of games to play outside with the children."
17829,5474,5," Good value for money. I would recommend tacky back to stiffen it for playing.The grandchildren thoroughly enjoy it."

17839,5475,5," Fast shipping&good!"
17840,5476,4," I'm really glad I bought this set for my skull and shackles campaign&They are very clear and easy to read (something I cannot say with all the different kinds of Q-workshop dice)Very yellow with bold brown styling."
17841,5476,5," I really like these inventive and cool dice for Pathfinder. Not only do they have a good size& you can also customize your experience from campaign to campaign& depending on the dice you use."
17842,5476,5," Fast delivery and simply stunning dice. I'm looking forward to using them with my gaming group."
17843,5476,5," Stunning dice!!! Every gamers' dream!!!"
17844,5477,5," These dice are exactly what I was expecting. :) The designs are all very clear and the dice feel lovely. I didn't find any stains on my dice as other reviewers have mentioned. They were packaged nicely and are in perfect condition. :) I even got a free D6 die decorated with a different design on each side& which I'll definitely be using! I'm very pleased and will definitely be buying more dice in the future. :)"

17846,5477,2," The dice look really nice in the picture however the dice I received all had a fair amount of dirty orange staining on them. I was looking forward to ordering some of the other designs on offer from Q-Workshop however after this experience& I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere! Hopefully this is merely a one-off and no one else will experience this."
17847,5477,4," Nice set of dice. Only downside is that the numbers on the D20 are pretty small (if you are getting on a bit like me!). Shame with these kind of designs that the D20's can't be made slightly larger to compensate (Same applies to the Elven dice set). The D6 looks really good. Overall a nice set of dice and the Black on White looks good."
17848,5477,4," I got these dice for my son and he likes them.  They are well made and pretty"
17849,5478,3," Was pleased at how quickly the game arrived but rather upset at how 'Americanised' it had become with extra categories and different scoring to the original game.  However& it served a purpose whilst on holiday."
17850,5478,5," Great all you need to play the game (pads& dice& rules and pencils) in one smallish box. Was a slow deliver but this was almost certainly down to the Christmas mail."
17851,5478,5," does the job& the die are small but that was good for me as I bought this to travel with but no complaints"
17852,5478,5," Very pleased with this item loved playing it when I was a kid now playing it with my own kids"
17853,5479,5," cheap& but abundant - perfect for those who just can't keep a complete set of dice."
17854,5480,5," This is my daughter's favourite game at 3 and has been for near on six months now since we first got it.  Shes not yet old enough for most board games or able to deal with skill& tactics or such and this is really good as a modern game for younger ones of I'd say 3 and up as well as being non character based and traditional.  Cards are thick and withstand heavy use which wasn't expected for the price.She is enthralled by the ladybird element as she is into bugs and the cards are large& bold images which are appealing. She even really likes the large red and white spots domino element and shaking the dice/turn taking.  there's lots of things to count basically& being a practical& educational Maths game involving counting and addition in the guise of a game so they do it happily without knowing it.  It is also designed to tie in with the National Curriculum KS1& encourage observation and logic skills and communication and sharing with others.We use it to play dominoes actually as a second game (spots or ladybirds)or do snap/number comparrisons with other players.Orcahrd toys in general I think are great and go down well....she also really likes  the |Shopping List Game| and |Farmyard Dominoes| by the same company."
17855,5480,5," A fun counting game by the well respected Orchard Toys& that helps pre-schoolers with their number work. Firstly you collect cards by throwing the dice& then when they have all been taken& you turn them over and count how many ladybirds you have each! A very simple game but lots of fun and older ones can join in too without being bored. This game takes about 10 minutes max to play so is ideal for the attention span of a pre-school child. I would heartily recommend this game. We play it every evening."
17856,5480,5," Great game& really helped with his counting and down to basics of turn taking!!  A real sucess only problem is he wants to play it all the time (aged 3)"
17857,5480,5," My 3 year old granddaughter simply loves this game& the first real box |game| she had been given.  It's a durable product& simple to play but at the same time is teaching counting - well worth buying"
17858,5480,4," We purchased this for our little boy who at the time was 2 years and 9 months.  His counting and recognition of numbers we thought was great at the time which is a reason behind why we got it for him& however he got bored with it very quickly and therefore the game would never be finished.  Now that he has turned 3 he is taking more interest in it and plays for longer but it is much better to be played with more than 2 people as the game then doesn't last that long.  The product however is a great tool for children to recognise the numbers and match them from the dice to the cards and is lots of fun.  The age range of this game is correct with a starting age of 3."
17859,5480,5," My 3 year old loves this game.  It's quick and easy to play and very educational.  Her counting has improved as we count the spots when we throw the dice.  It's also helped her understanding of 'taking turns' and that sometimes you win but sometimes you lose.The box and pieces are robust and have been taken to pubs& restaurants as well as peoples houses and been in contact with sticky figners etc.The whole family from Grannies downward are now very familar with it.  I've had to buy some other orchard games just to give us a break from this one as we were having to play it 10 times a day at one point!I've now bought this as a present for other kids - I can't recommend it highly enough."
17860,5480,5," My little boy is 3 and loves this game it is great for counting as well as getting used to the spot patterns on the dice as these match to the cards. My one crit would be that the dice is quite small and for counting spots can be quite difficult...saying that he coped very well with the dice and didn't bother him at all& but just somrthing to consider."
17861,5480,5," I bought this to take on holiday with us in an effort to entertain our 3 year old.  She really enjoyed it and to be honest I did too.  It can be played within 2 minutes of opening the box and it's very simple to pick up& encouraging counting and matching skills.  It's a great way to prepare them for snakes"
17862,5481,5," Not only are they the two best colours conceivable"
17863,5481,5," There's always a worry when you buy a product like this that the reality won't look as good as the picture& that the people who photographed them carefully picked the best of the batch for the sales shot. But these dice look as brilliant in reality as in the photo."
17864,5481,5," So so so so pretty& font super clear& high contrast& high quality moldings& glaze very nice. Perfect. Only problem is everybody else bloody knicking them constantly! It's worse than a Dwarf ring for corruption by pretties."
17865,5481,5," Very attractive& easy to read& good feel. Greeney-purple so good for Cthulhu. Quality medium size dice. None of your Big Cheery rubbish here. Recommended."
17866,5481,5," Nice cool looking dice. Nice mix of the colours especially when catching the light and then they really pop. Numbers are easy to read."
17867,5482,4," I like the actual sleeves& they are the correct size for MTG& and shuffle very nicely - it is actually easier to shuffle your deck with these sleeves on than without any sleeves.  My only gripe is that MTG  generally has a 60 card deck (as well as other games& ie yu gi oh has 40 to 60)& so with multiple decks being built& the cost of two packs per deck gets frustrating."
17868,5482,5," If you want high-quality sleeves that feels great& shuffles easily and makes your cards& whatever they may be& look great then this is for you."
17869,5482,5," I bought a load of these for my MTG decks. They feel amazing& don't stick at all& make shuffling a breeze& and& bonus: they're green! :D"
17870,5482,5," wanted some sleeves to keep rare cards safe. Can't fault them :)Delivery was fast and item as advertised"
17871,5482,5," kinda cool i only needed 23 but thanks coz one part of my family needed the spaces thank you very much"
17872,5482,5," Exactly what they say they are. NO messing around"
17873,5482,5," Everyone knows that Ultra pro Is a great brand& and as per usual they haven't disappointed.The cards look great and feel great in these& you can hardly tell by looking at the front that they have a cover of them& the glare is nonexistent. Price and postage from here is great too!One thing I would say is that if you have |shiny| cards that you want to be able to see clearly then don't go for the matte. A few people switched and decided to switch back& just because you can't tell foil cards from normal ones well. It may seem like an obvious thing& but the difference was quite surprising."
17874,5482,4," Good price well made fits snugly my cards am happy delivered on time"
17875,5483,4," Sturdy game for lots of use. Do wish it had a lid to keep the dice from getting lost& but my main disappointment& (hence the 4 stars) was that the retaining bar under the number tabs was glued in place on a slant& and not straight& making it look slightly tacky. If I had been able to see before I bought& I would have chosen one with the bar in the right place."
17876,5483,4," I heard about this game about 5 yrs ago and meant to buy it for my daughter& so when my twin boys started school& I thought this would be great for them to learn maths through play. Both love the game and it's really easy for them to play by themselves. There is a bit of competition between them and they're learning without even knowing it.  Very simple idea& but very effective."
17877,5483,4," would have given this 5 stars but the wooden dice were missing from the set.  It was a shame seeing as this was a birthday present.  However&  I have sent a message to the seller but am still waiting for a reply.  Game is frustratingly addictive and annoyingly enjoyable."
17878,5483,5," A simple& but entertaing game.I bought it& as it's an entertains game for me and my 5 years old son.  Because of the game roles& he should do maths&.so it's fun and educating.As we have Amazon prim& the parcel was delivered the day after we order it."
17879,5483,5," Never play this game for money against my 5 year old daughter - you will lose!!!! Such a simple little design but really good for the kids to make number links.  Wish I had got the travel version as this is just a little too bulky to take out on trips."
17880,5483,5," Bought three. Including one for us. Everyone loves it. Good quality too."
17881,5483,1," I ordered three of the small games with the lid and these came and they came without a delivery note and I am now having trouble returning the items"
17882,5483,5," Brilliant yet SOOO simple. Good for kids to practice their mental arithmetic. Can play it for hours. Very good buy."
17883,5484,4," Very beautiful and striking design"
17884,5484,5," just what you'd expect from Chessex. very good indeed. and a great price."
17885,5484,5," My orc husband relies on these things."
17886,5484,5," Why can't you get six sided dice with dots on anymore? Lol these are nice dice though ðŸ˜‰"
17887,5485,4," This is great for keeping boredom at bay. Highly addictive and always absorbing. You can either have a fully sonic action with lots of beeps and bops while you play& but this will be sure to annoy anyone in earshot. Simply press the sound button to mute it so that no one can hear your dirty secret. The device fits in the hand comfortably.What i thought could be improved: Bigger HOLD buttons on the handset would be appreciated. It's good to hold and roll quickly and rattle through the rounds as fast as possible& but the smaller buttons slow me down a bit.Highly recommended to kids and adults alike."
17888,5485,3," Some of the  buttons on this model are a little bit small& my previous one was much easier to use."
17889,5485,5," Bought it for a gift...it is a great replacement for an old one that brokeThe person who received it loves it .."
17890,5485,5," Been looking for something like this for ages.  My husband broke the last one but we had had it about 10 years!"
17891,5485,4," I was pleased to be able to replace my old model. Does not feel as solid as my old version but overall good."
17892,5485,5," I really love this game - but we warned - very addictive.  Very easy instructions so all age groups can play without any probs.  Good size screen and very easy to read symbols"
17893,5485,4," very good replacement for my old one but the hold buttons could have been a bit larger otherwise ok would by from hasbro again"
17894,5485,5," Bought it for my elderly mum but then realised that she wouldn't have a clue what to do with it. So gifted it to myself - only downside is that it is totally addictive!!!!"
17895,5486,5," My nephew received a great board game for Christmas that came with a spinner. Whilst the game was great the 1-10 sections on the spinner constantly moved and became a real source of irritation. Having the spinner land half way between two numbers is just asking for trouble in a competitive family game! So my fix to this problem was these lovely& brightly coloured die. OK I only needed one but at the price they were offered I was happy to buy five!"
17896,5486,5," Pretty& bright yellow quality dice. Buy it"
17897,5487,4," Nice dice& good quality and fluorescence is very bright. Pleased with purchase& swift delivery. Good product but you'd expect it to be for the price"
17898,5488,4," Great dice& they roll numbers between 0 and 9 every time!"
17899,5489,4," nice dice& but one of the dice has been blemished and the design is distorted making it a little unreadable"
17900,5490,5," Clear numbers& nice size and feel& well made."
17901,5491,5," Fantastic value for money& quality is alright. Some of the numbers are faint and there was paint on some of the dice faces. But the price is amazing and the colours are gorgeous. Superb."
17902,5491,5," Great set of dice."
17903,5491,4," Good mix of dice"
17904,5492,5," A fine set of dice... just make sure you don't roll them near anything fragile! Markings take some getting used to& but they are clear and legible."
17905,5493,3," I've long been a fan of steampunk and when I saw their dice and this accompanying bag I had to get them.  When this arrived I was very disappointed with the quality and feel of the product.  It is a linen bag as advertised but doesn't have that quality feel I expect from steampunk.  I would have returned it but after the return postage charges its hardly worth it."
17906,5493,5," Really love this& makes a lot of my friends jealous& so now there is a suite of new dice and dice bags at the table."
17907,5493,5," Very nice and well made dice bag for all of my new Q-workshop dice!"

17910,5494,5," Very good dice. Good detail in the numbers and symbols.It took me a while to get used to the faction symbol being a 6& but that might just be me. Also& tell your opponent about that otherwise they'll get confused."

17912,5495,5," I already have the standard Rory story cubes and they have been incredible fun to make up stories with the family or to give me ideas for my own stories which I post on various websites which have had good reviews.You can use them as they are on their own or you can remove three random cubes from the standard cube pack and replace them with these.  They make the stories more mythical/fantasy and add an extra dimension to the story telling.  As with all the cubes in the range& they are well made and have a pleasant chunky weighty feel that suggests quality.  I recommend this particularly if you have a family and you want more family fun together.  What could be better than the oldest traditional past time from the beginning of time...story telling.  With these even the youngest can join in the fun."
17913,5495,4," Love story cubes! These were a perfect stocking filler and can be used with or without the main set."
17914,5496,5," A set of six zombie-themed dice.  The numbers 2& 3& 4 and 5 look like bullet holes and the numbers 1 and 6 are represented by a molotov cocktail and a zombie head respectively."

17919,5499,4," They're alright. I think I should have gone for something more exciting& in hindsidght."
17920,5499,5," They look lovely and are smooth. They roll well and have become my first choice dice"
17921,5500,5," My son loves them!"
17922,5501,4," Very much as described& but just be wary that it says 'at least 5 colours' - was hoping to end up with 10 dice of 5 different colours each as per other review& but ended up with 5 dice of 10 different colours!Got white& black& grey& cream& brown& red& purple& blue and green and yellow dice. All pips are white except on the white and cream dice which are black pipped. Grey and yellow may have looked better black pipped& but again it's as in the picture and no major issue.As for the dice themselves - probably what you'd expect for the price. Consistent overall in size with slightly small feel(sure they're 12mm as stated& but unable to measure). Some variance in dot sizes and spacing between colours but consistent within colours themselves - painting of pits is variable and looks mildly rough on some - however again possibly what you'd expect for the price.On the whole I'd call it a cost-effective way to get a large set of dice! Happy that it was at least consistent number of each(ie 5 of each colour) even though I was hoping for 10x5! Can't particularly fault the description or anything though& just my own expectations!"
17923,5501,5," Smaller than I thought but it makes for more fun when playing. 5 of all coulors. Arrived by due date."
17924,5501,4," well made and there are no faults with them"
17925,5502,5," BEWARE! there may be a free dice in your package (I nearly threw mine out with the packaging).  The dice are really nice looking& exactly like the images& worth the 5 stars I gave them.  A very MINOR problem is that I found some of the numbers a little hard to read at first but I'm getting used to them (I don't look at the opposite face to check anymore)."
17926,5502,5," I love the Q workshop 3D dice range&Clear and easy to read dice with a great look to boot.I recently purchased the yellow Celtic 3D and thought that they may bea bit too bright and vivid but they arrived and looked fantastic.People have already commented how cool they look and i totally agree."
17927,5502,5," Really lovely design& these made the perfect nerdy gift for my boyfriend.You threw in a clear D10 as well into my package... Not sure if you were meant to& but thanks! That is also nice."
17928,5503,5," What can I say& they are dice. The quality is excellent as what I would expect from any of the branded companies but a fraction of the cost& packaging and delivery also excellent. I bought them for a public gaming event and they stood up to the task nicely."
17929,5503,5," As described& prompt delivery& ideal for purpose ordered."
17930,5503,5," Great bag of fun dice all colours"
17931,5504,4," The Action cubes are a great addition if you already have the Story cubes! Or buy this one first and then add on the other ... The Creativity Hub Rory's Story CubesThey can be used alone but mixed together the stories can now get more interesting and fun.The cubes are the same great quality as the Story cubes and identical shape - great that they are printed in blue so you can tell them apart and pack them away easily."
17932,5504,4," I bought the 3 sets or story cubes for my kids (5&5&4) and they are really enjoying them - clear 5 stars.However there is a quality difference in the stories from the green and orange to this blue set.Compared to orange/green sets& the blue pictures have less interpretations and less interactions between them - the blue stories tend to become a sequence of actions without plots. Also the youngest (4) has more problems interpreting the complex blue pictures than she has with the other colours.If using the cubes for teaching languages or creative writing& the blue set is a must-have addition (the blues are all verbs& the others substantives)& but as a kids/family game i would recommend the orange and green sets before the blue.3 stars as stand-alone& 5 stars if filling out the set."
17933,5504,4," As is usually the case with games& the most simple ideas are often the best. How much easier to play could a game be than picking up a handful of 'story cube' dice throwing them on the table and then& letting your imagination be guided by the combination of random images your throw has provided& either writing or telling a story beginning with 'Once Upon A Time'?Rory's Story Cubes are not only educational& fun& and challenging they are perfect for parties when late in the hour the dancing has ceased and people are chatting around a table with a glass of wine. Writing clubs will also find them an invaluable tool for inspiring great works from members at workshops and the best thing about them is that there are millions of possible combinations so no two workshops will ever be the same!The cubes come in a really tough little box with a magnetic fastener (nice touch!). They are of good quality manufacture and even repeated use is unlikely to cause any of the print to come off unlike many other cheap dice games.Add to the fun the fact that other 'themed' sets ('Voyages'"
17934,5504,5," I love it. Great for my classes specially popular between my esl A2 pre intermediate groups . Really good to use when trying to elicit your students to speak."
17935,5504,5," Bought these as my daughter is a bit of a book worm and loves writing stories however she does get stuck for ideas at times. She is 9 years old. We took this with us to a family wedding in my bag and my daughter and cousins thought it was great fun making up stories. The kids spend ages doing this and everyone thought it was a good laugh including the adults.Would recommend to children who love stories but don't want to write things down."
17936,5504,5," Great product!  Very useful as a means to make students think! Great tool for any teacher teaching children or adults."
17937,5504,5," I bought this action themed set together with the original Rory's story cubes (orange set)& which I have already reviewed.The action set is an add-on set of story cubes to compliment the original set& but they can also be played without the orange set.Thats one of the reasons& I like Rory's story cubes& because of the unique playing experience that does not mean you must buy all of the add-ons to get to play.I like the variations in the themes that allow you to mix and match or just own one set.These toys are a breath of fresh air amongst all the gimmicky and lazy electronic games."
17938,5504,4," I wouldn't purchase these stand-alone as we found it slightly tricky to come up with stories that aren't just a list of simple actions. Having said that& these dice are a great add-on to the other Rory's Story Cubes sets: Original and Voyages. Some symbols are a little hard to decipher at first but after a good look you'll hit yourself on the head for being so silly - of course! It's a person climbing a tree!Dice themselves - 19mm& for anybody wondering or looking to incorporate them into a wider game using self-made dice - are extremely well made and boast an unprecedented high-quality. A simple game that can be built upon using pure creativity and imagination: add a timer& points for competitive play& etc. Endless possibilities. Worth every penny!"
17939,5505,5," I only really ordered this set beause it contained 6 dice& which I wanted for a particular dice game. But I have to say I'm very impressed with the whole package. It comes with a rule book for some interesting games& includes pre-printed scorecards and a blank pad for the others. As well as some plastic chips and a nice set of poker dice.Excellent value!"
17940,5505,4," It arrived swiftly& without fault.  My son and I have enjoyed playing with it& and have only played two games so far!My only recommendation would be for parents of children who aren't readily familiar with Yatzee scoring& go ahead and buy a real Yahtzee score sheet.  The ones included in the box don't have numerical values and have additional sections intended for other games.  Not very functional for a seven-year-old who has never played the game before.  That said& it's an easily remedied distraction for a great deal of family enjoyment!"
17941,5505,5," Had no real ideal what this would consist of but the grandchildren are obsessed with dice games - this was excellent&"
17942,5505,4," This is a great game for family evening around the table. Lots of options and fun here."
17943,5505,3," I bought this for the maxi yahzee pad... and it's fun. I could have put this together myself& but where can you buy dice these days?"
17944,5506,4," This is really neat& it does exactly what it claims.If you have a challenge with folks taking a long time then see if they will try having the cube in play.Even if you do not impose a penalty system (say 1VP per min over your share of the recommended total game time) it can be quite illuminating to see who is using up the minutes.Lots of slow players dont believe they are slow& get some data and discuss it rationaly"
17945,5506,5," This little cube has stopped any arguments while we play games...your time is up when it starts to beep! Does exactly what it is supposed to do and is easy to use."
17946,5507,3," The quality is ok but nothing special. I would say though that it is actually 5x4 and not 6x4 as advertised."
17947,5507,4," The bag arrived swiftly and though the feel was not what I expected it was still a durable product for the dice I bought& since I was only guessing on the size in the first place it seems big enough for about 30 dice which is excellent for a beginner to dice games."
17948,5507,5," I purchased this to use as a dust cover for a studio microphone ( SE Z5600a Mk2 ). Looks really cool ( better than the sandwich bag I was using previously! ). Great little item and delivered promptly although shipped from the States."
17949,5507,5," Just what I needed to create my spell.PotionsPotionsPotionsGreat price for this product& not as easy to find.  But amazon always does it!"
17950,5508,3," Together with the postage this was far to expensive for the quantity and quality of the product& buying the cards and 24 dice was cheaper with no postage cost and would allow for a good many more people to play making this far more suitable for older peoples games."
17951,5508,2," Very disappointed. Pad inside todraw  beetle was very small and also the pieces provided. Would not reccommend this particular item to anyone."
17952,5508,4," The game is fine but as it is used in a complex housing older people I found the actual Score Pads rather small for failing eyesight. Managed to increase size on printer to make for easier use."
17953,5508,5," Nice little box& cards and pencils basic but acceptable quality. The game itself was such fun. We organised a sort of beetle drive - 12 players& 3 generations - and everyone enjoyed it."
17954,5508,4," Enjoyable but basic game. Reminds me of my childhood and was great to share with my Granddaughter!"
17955,5509,5," Nice quality feel about these Dice. Having lost Dice over the years& decided to upgrade. These Dice complements the Games that  the Dice were purchased for."
17956,5510,5," I bought this for my granddaughter aged about 20 months at the time.  It has been played with ever since and she is now three and a half.  We started using the cards for word recognition& then finding two of a kind& now finding something beginning with a certain letter and just recently she is beginning to use them for the pairs game as originally intended.  It can be made as easy or as difficult as you wish by the number of cards you include.  It has proved to be a very good purchase."
17957,5510,4," I bought this game for my 2 year Gradnd daughter on the birth of her brother.She loves the pictures and enjoys finding the other half to a pair .We are only using a few pairs at the moment to make it easier for her but each time we played we added more cards  as she was getting too good at it."
17958,5510,3," Bought these for the children. The card used is pretty basic and doesn't look like it would last long with younger/careless children.If they are old enough not to bite or bend the pieces& then this will be hours worth of fun - good for the brain too."
17959,5511,5," This game is just brilliant for those holidays when you don't know what to do.  It has an easy pouch to put all the dice into and fits into a small corner of a handbag. Games for all ages are catered for and we had many hours of fun laughs and downright devious moves. A good stocking filler."
17960,5512,5," I bought this as a little stocking filler for my Dad for Christmas as he enjoys golf.  He played it and really enjoyed it.  It is basically like a golf version of the board/dice game Yahtzee!I would recommend for anyone that enjoys playing games and as a little stocking filler although I think my dad would have loved it just as much as if it had been his main present!"
17961,5512,5," Excellent gift delivered on time."
17962,5512,5," Great game"
17963,5512,5," great"
17964,5513,5," We love this game and had great fun with it over Christmas. Only critisism of this game is that the box is an open design& making it difficult to contain the loose pieces. we have discarded the original box and put the game in a container to avoid any loss."
17965,5513,4," Enjoyed  by loads of children from age 4 through to 11.  Packaging means you cannot keep the counters safely with game once opened - need a separate box otherwise the parts will get lost!"
17966,5514,5," I enjoy the card game Phase 10& but I do find its length a bit frustrating.  That's why I enjoy playing Phase 10 Dice so much.  The concept is the same& only it's designed to take a lot less time to play.  Plus& you can play with a group of any size.  Heck& they even give you ideas on how to play by yourself.Inside the tin you get when you buy the game& you'll find instructions& score pads (although you can create your own)& and 10 dice.  Four dice contain the numbers 1-4 and two wild spots while the other six dice contain the numbers 5-10.Just like in the original Phase 10& the object is to roll ten previously created phases in order.  For each phase& you need to roll a number of sets (3 of the same number)& a run (4-7 for example)& or some combination of the two.  The further along you go& the harder it is to complete your phase.  You have three rolls per turn to get your phase.  If you get it& you record a score based on the dice used to complete the phase.  If you miss& you have to work on that phase on your next turn.As another twist on the card game& the objective here is to get the highest final score you can (instead of a low score in the original).  Once one player completes phase 10& everyone gets one last turn to complete as many phases as they can.  Only after everyone has taken that last turn do you compare scores.  The overall high score wins.Because there are only 10 dice in the game& some of the later phases where you need 8 or 9 get really tricky.  Additionally& there is a strategy involved in picking the dice so that you can potentially roll what you need before your turn is over.  I like that twist.I have played the card version of Phase 10 in a very large group for two hours and not had anyone come close to winning.Read more â€º"

17969,5514,5," Great"
17970,5515,5," Fabulous for encouraging imaginative storytelling and could be used by an individual or by a group. I think to get the best from this product you need to buy along with other sets in order to give a variety of options or scenarios."
17971,5515,5," My 6 year old grandson plays Story Cubes with his Mum and Dad& and they have a lot of fun with them. They've adapted the rules about turn taking& sharing the story telling.

17972,5515,5," We just love these& we have all the sets& they are great for long journeys& power cuts and holidays. The adults enjoy rolling them and creating stories too with lots of sets rolled together&(especially after a drink when the children have gone to bed!"

17977,5515,5," Bought these before and always popular with friends who  go on to buy themselves."
17978,5516,5," Overview: These are a set of cubes which show a different image on each face. The aim of these are for the children to roll them and put them in order to make a sequence ready for a story. The child is then to use their imagination to create a story based on those characters& props and themes.PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE ARE THE MAX CUBES WHICH ARE THE LARGER VERSION OF THE SAME IMAGES FOR THE ORIGINAL SET.Some images include: kicking& falling& shovelling& walking through a door& unable to reach something high& fire& laughing& thinking& carrying something heavy& drying clothes& cutting& choosing a direction& giving a gift& walking& dancing etc.Uses: These are a fantastic resource to use in the classroom or at home.

17979,5517,4," These dice are awesome but beware they are like the cthulu dice& very difficult to read. Other than that they are nice looking and weighty!"
17980,5518,4," Personally I love this& always been a fan of red/black colour scheme. The dice look great& they feel great and personally& I'm super happy. I love the designs& the font is great and the dragon around them just adds more to it.If I'm happy with it& why the 4 stars? Simply because some of the players can't read red on a black background. The d20 is especially hard for them as the numbers are quite small due to the dragon around each number.if you can see red on black& I'd definitely recommend these. They are worth it!"
17981,5518,5," The dice look great& and the design looks awesome in red and black. They aren't particularly heavy dice& but they are well balanced. The numbers are easy to read& and the design doesn't look too busy. Good quality dice that I shall use regularly."
17982,5518,5," These dice were bought as a gift and come very well recommended& these are easily the best I've ever purchased."

17986,5521,5," My son is 5 and in reception.  He has really enjoyed playing this.  He loved winning the dinos off me and barely noticed he was practicing his maths!  The game comes with a little bag for putting in the dice and dinos so it is perfect for taking on holiday etc.  I would definitely recommend it."
17987,5521,5," I bought these for my 5 year old son who is doing basic addition and subtraction at school. We have found them fantastic. THe dinosaurs and dice came in a little green bag which is perfect for keeping in a handbag and I am able to pull them out and play when he gets fed up waiting around for things. He loves the game and doesn't even notice it's a learning game. Even my Older son enjoys playing them even though the maths is a bit basic for him he likes it as a game of stealing the dinosaurs& we have now ordered him his own set with multiplication dice too because we enjoy them so much and they are handy. I totally recommend these dice and dinosaurs& the dinosaurs have friendly faces so the kids think they are cute."
17988,5521,5," Really good for kids as they are learning maths in a way that is not dry or makes them clam up or get bored.  It is really usefull to lighten up the learning process."
17989,5521,5," Dino Dice is a great& fun and educational resource.I teach kids with Special Needs and they love this game. It really helps with addition and subtraction without it seeming like a chore. My students love it and ask to play it."
17990,5521,5," This is a very simple game that can easily be fitted in your handbag for an outing or plane journey! It is brilliant for early number work& adding 1 or 2 more. My daughter has no idea she is actually learning when we play! A great buy!"
17991,5521,4," My grandchildren love dinasaurs so I think they will appreciate this game the younger ones can be supported by the older children and I think this will encourage the 4 year old to recognise how to add up."
17992,5521,5," It is a brilliant quick and easy game to play which can be used anywhere.  It comes in a little bag so  is easy to transport.  The game is quick to play so can be played when only have a few mins spare.  We take it to play while waiting for food in a restaurant to keep the children.  My son is in reception at school and it reinforces numbers& addition and doing sums at speed.  First class product.  A must for young children."
17993,5521,4," Got this for our 5 year-old son.  As far as he's concerned& it's great& and has him playing around with numbers more than before.  Enough said."
17994,5522,5," Overview: These are a set of cubes which show a different image on each face. The aim of these are for the children to roll them and put them in order to make a sequence ready for a story. The child is then to use their imagination to create a story based on those characters& props and themes.Animalia includes images of: jellyfish& fox/racoon& shark& lizard& cow& sign saying not to feed the animals& owl& swan& lion& acorn etc.Fright includes images of: monster opening a door& hand coming out of the soil& spider& skull& clown etcMythic includes images of: caveman& trident& ship& maze& horse etcUses: These are a fantastic resource to use in the classroom or at home. They come in a variety of styles which will suit different topics and children's interests. In the classroom they can be used individually with children or they could be used as a whole group with each child having a different image to add to the whole class story (e.g. sit in a circle and try to add a sequence to the running story). At home& or in the car journey they can be used to keep children amused and stimulated throughout.They are:> Compact& lightweight and durable.> Come in a lovely presentation box to keep them safe!> Have a different image on each face e.g a character& prop or themes/ideas.> Have a variety of themes to choose from e.g. other imagination ones and a new batman one has just been released.Would highly recommend to anyone who has children or works with them! They are fab!!!! Many hours of enjoymentActivity ideas:> Could be used to help develop EAL learners language recall. This may include rolling a dice and the children in the small EAL group need to say the key word as quick as possible.Read more â€º"
17995,5522,5," Santa brought the starter pack for my little boy last Christmas (aged 3) The Creativity Hub Rory's Story Cubes and for the past year& this toy has always (and  mean that!) been out. Either on the coffee table or the kitchen table or the living room floor. To start with& my son's stories were what you would expect from a 3 year old& now (Aged 4) they're as good as my own! A the very top of his Christmas list this year& he asked Santa very nicely for some more Story Cubes to |Add to his collection& to help Mam tell better stories!| *Hmpf*. Hopefully I can convince him to leave them all downstairs on Christmas evening so all the adults can have a few games too!With an extra 54 sides to choose from& I am probably looking forward to him opening these more than he will be to receive them! Also& a great little creative writing tool too& especially with the different themes available. There is bound to be a set that would appeal to everybody!"
17996,5522,5," Rory's Story Cubes& what can I say& the best game since... (<--- Insert game name here). An absolutely brilliant idea& |Rory| should be given a knighthood& brings out the storyteller in all ages.  The packaging is really well thought out and is small enough to fit into a suitcase or backpack if you're heading away for a few days.  This is our go-to game whoever's company we're in.  The additional dice serve to mix up the stories a little."
17997,5522,5," Super"
17998,5523,5," Great sleeves for your MTG card collection& each card fits snuggly and allows you to shuffle your card library with ease. It also adds a particular flair to your deck& in line with your personal mana inclinations. They are definitely more expensive than your run-of-the-mill transparent card sleeves& but you'll see and feel the difference the moment you start using them for your own cards."
17999,5524,5," The dice cam in a nice box. The dice are well made and worth the money. I enjoyed ruining my PC's day with them"
18000,5524,5," Really striking and lovely dice. They're not always the easiest to read due to the font& but you can see that in the pictures so you know what you're getting. Just be careful which seller you end up with - mine ended up not coming from the manufacturer (Q-Workshop) but from a reseller in the USA and they took over two weeks to arrive."
18001,5524,5," High Quality and& unlike other dice I have bought from others& the numbers are clear and readable. These will ensure the downfall of some heroes in Dungeons and Dragons 3:)"
18002,5524,5," Really good quality dice couldn't have asked for better and shipped quite quick too"
18003,5524,5," Speedy delivery.  Good quality for the price. My friend loved them."
18004,5524,5," A great set of dice& well worth buying. Nothing else to say."
18005,5524,4," Overpriced& but the best damn D"
18006,5525,5," Our 3 year old loves this.  A colours version for younger kids and the proper game when they're old enough"
18007,5525,5," What a lovely board game.  Two sides - one can be played using a coloured die and coloured squares for children who can't count and the other a traditional dice.  There are not too many snakes meaning that it doesn't take so long that boredom sets in and the pieces are a manageable size.  I think for the price it is great value."
18008,5525,5," This is the second time I have bought this game - makes a great present."
18009,5525,5," Great game before you even play. The board is a jigsaw that you put together. Double sided with a simpler version on one side for younger players. Good size dice& you get 2 for different versions of the game. My 4 year old loves it."
18010,5525,5," My boys loved this and i love the fact that there is an easy version as well as the normal version so my 2"
18011,5525,5," Great game with two versions. The Colour side is great for younger children whereas the other side has is the normal numbers& good for those learning to use dice. My three year old loves it."
18012,5525,5," my niece loved it for her 3rd birthday. It's great as it has the simpler game done by colours on the back& so it grows with them. She has declared it as her 'bestist' present!!"
18013,5526,5," Brilliant as expected& the colours are beautiful."
18014,5527,5," I bought this as a gift for one of my friends as they roleplay as a red dragonborn sorcerer. As you can tell by the good review& it went down well and I'm assured that it is of good quality and they bring it regularly with them so it's very sturdy too. It fits 2/3 sets of 7 dice perfectly."
18015,5527,4," Good product as described. My nephew loved it."

18020,5529,5," What do you do when your children want to play their favourite board game and you've lost not one& but both of the dice?Well of course first you go to another game and try and raid that box and then quickly remember you did that last time! The dice have gone the way of half of many a pair of socks and vanished into the unknown!Here is your solution - buy a couple of these oversized dice and you not only can get on a play your game& but they are harder to lose! Problem solved!"
18021,5529,5," The dice were well packed and arrived on time. I really wanted black dice but the offer said assorted colours - but I was delighted to receive 2 black dice and 1 red dice& which are ideal for the children's floor game for Halloween! On one of the dice the dot was off centre but this did not make any difference to or effect the randomness of the dice. The dice are true to photo size and are ideal for children to use or those with dexterity problems. I was tempted to get foam dice and now I am in receipt of the extra large wooden dice I am glad I chose these as they will last much better than foam!"
18022,5529,1," To start with you can't pick colours& with a random assortment of dice i'd hope for at least two different colours. Nope. Both Green. Fine. Not a massive problem. But this is only the start.Next& they come with a sticker on them! Oh joy. And it doesn't peel easily! Have fun trying to peel the sticker from the wood& without ruining it& or peeling of the paint. And by the way& the sticker has a tighter bond to the wood than my anus does to me.NEXT! The dots. A wonderful golden colour. Too bad half of them had already flaked off& and brand new in the box no less!And wouldn't you believe that the few dots that have survived& are actually double printed? I thought I had to get my glasses& was seeing two layers& poorly aligned on top of eachother& on the wood faces.Honestly I have no idea how this product got so many good reviews. Because these dice are pretty damn poor. Go spend your money elsewhere if you're looking for pretty& good quality dice. I don't imagine the dots will even last that long given their current state.0/5& would rate below 1 star if I could."
18023,5529,4," The dice are good quality and just what I wanted in some respects. The problem I have& however& is that when the three arrived there were two green and one yellow ( or something supposedly yellow - more of a light sand colour) despite the fact that although you couldn't specify  a particular  colour it did state that there would be a mixture of colours! I had previously purchased a single dice to see if this was what I wanted and& guess what& that was also green! I have no time to send them back so I just find this a little disappointing& especially as my grandson loves blue!"
18024,5529,4," Bit disappointing the spots are already starting to wear off but for the price or from the picture I shouldn't have expected them to be recessed into the wood. My daughter can already recognize numerals at 2 so this is a new challenge for her to have to count the dots where I don't have to worry about her putting the dice in her mouth. For older children I'm guessing it will prevent the lost dice situation every time you want to play a game."
18025,5529,4," When playing games with people who are visually impaired it's difficult for them to see where the dice has gone and what number it says (you can't trust people to always tell you the truth)& these dice (f did buy two) remove the temptation to tell them they've landed on go to jail and make games night a bit fairer.They will also bowl games pieces off boards and scatter houses& so if you're not playing on the floor& you might want to use a box lid to contain where they go!"
18026,5529,5," Rolls beautifully and easy for little hands to control - and grown ups too for that matter! I would recommend this di."
18027,5529,4," These were exactly what I needed. I've had to take all the dice out of the children's games as choking hazard for the little one. Have put them in a safe place!These are lovely and chunky. There was a sticker on them but it peeled off easily. i have no problem with any of my dots being missing/mis-aligned or chipping off.For the price I am very happy."
18028,5530,5," Nice dice"
18029,5531,5," Very pleased with the Dice"
18030,5532,5," Great game!"
18031,5533,4," The box is flimsy& but the dice are spot on. Came quickly& well packaged. Just what you need to stand out in 40k& my son loves them."
18032,5534,5," Excellent small game for playing at the table with the grandchildren whilst waiting for meal to arrive.  It is a quick game& which appeals to the adults as well."
18033,5534,5," This game has already become a family favourite and our four older grandchildren like to play the game. Two of the grandchildren are ten and two are four.  Our ten month old grandson likes to watch everyone playing (there are 13 of us who play regularly).  We have substituted the counters for smarties and for some reason the children always seem to win!  A super game and easy to pack to take on holiday.  I have given as birthday gifts for men and they really like it."
18034,5534,5," Brilliant game.  No complicated rules.  Gives hours of family fun.  Have been looking for this game for some time since losing the set I purchased in the States a few years ago.  Would highly recommend.  I ordered the triple pack so that the rest of the family can enjoy the game with their friends.  The service was excellent as the product arrived very quickly after placing the order."
18035,5534,5," The product arrived next day as promised - excellent product& excellent service and excellent price!The game Left Centre Right is a new one to me and already I have had lots of fun playing this game!  Easy and FUN - glad I bought it!"
18036,5534,4," A simple game shown to us by a friend on holiday ( small so takes up hardly any space). A game that all the family can play. We play it together with ages from 4 to 65! Also helped to teach the 4 year old right and left& turn taking etc."
18037,5534,3," Please be aware - when I saw this advertised - it showed a ' Tin Box' - which  I thought it came in - when the game arrived it was on its own - disappointed as brought this because of the tin for travelling which would make it easy"
18038,5534,5," We brought this as a family game after reading good reviews. My boys aged 5 and 9 found it easy to learn  and it has taught the younger one left and right. We even played it with chocolate money to help with the concept of sharing!"
18039,5535,5," Fantasic product& looks exactly how it is displayed. The colours were brilliant and bright. Just adds an excellent feel to our L5R RPG. Good gift for my Dragon friend."
18040,5536,5," I got the green ones and they look and feel awesome I'm very happy with them and they came earlier than expected. It also came with a free D6 I wasn't expecting."
18041,5536,3," Dices are well made. Design is awesome. Only issue is that green numbers are hard to see on green/black background."
18042,5536,5," Excellent"
18043,5537,4," Seem hard enough with the right shape& readable numbers"
18044,5537,4," I love these dice& the marbled effect looks very cool and makes them a nice addition to my collection. The only little gripe I have is that on some of mine& the marbling has ended up as half the die being completely white& where it hasn't blended in with the translucent green. If you just don't look at that side of the few dice affected& it's not a big deal and they're still great overall. Even with the colour in some places& it's what you have to expect from marbled or gemini-style dice."
18045,5537,3," Sadly& while extremely pretty& these dice can be really hard to read. Gold on white is not a great combination. I bought this set& the red and the blue (the blue isn't as pretty as the other two& in my opinion). Unfortunately& though the D20 from this set is my favourite of the three& I've had to switch to the red D20 while I try to work out how best to repaint the numbers."
18046,5537,3," The  colour is more black than purple  on arrival looks nothing like on line picture"
18047,5537,4," Nice colour effect with gold number print. Normal playing dice size. Pack of 6 - D6& 8& 10& 12& 20& 00"
18048,5537,5," I love them! The dice are beautiful in colours and pattern. The dice are very well balanced and work great in game and just for playing around with."
18049,5537,5," very cool outright& the marble designs look practically hand painted such is the high quality. very cool& perfect set out dice outright."
18050,5538,5," good dvd"
18051,5539,1," A bit thin as you can see the dots thru them but ok for what we need"
18052,5539,5," Arrived on time.  Very good quality.  Hours of fun for the children!"
18053,5539,5," Five stars well deserved.Couldn't believe how fast this was delivered to my uncle. As the next day was a Sunday& I certainly wasn't expecting such an amazing response. Within 24 hours it was at my uncles door. And it came from Dumfrieshire.Fantastic. He said that the dominoes were also good quality made of bone."
18054,5539,5," wonderful box of dominoes&well worth the price."
18055,5539,4," Appear to be of good quality for the money."
18056,5540,4," I have been a fan of Friends ever since it started& and like nothing better than watching the re-runs whenever I happen to catch them on TV! When someone gave me this game for a birthday present& I was really pleased.You get to choose from Friends related items as your playing piece& amongst them a coffee cup& a Laz-E-Boy chair and the frame found on Monica's door around the peephole (my piece of choice)! As with the normal Scene It& you can play a short round or a longer game& and questions vary from guessing the next line to be said (this is usually multiple choice)& working out anagrams of guest stars& answering a question from a crossword& and many other questions from the 10 series. If I had my way& I would get rid of the multiple choice options (sometimes this makes it too easy)& and it's also important that you have at least one other Friends addict to play against& otherwise it's not much fun!A very entertaining game for fans of the show."
18057,5540,5," Bought this as a Christmas present for my partner and we have both thoroughly enjoyed playing it& just the 2 of us and with a group of others.  Although we have both seen every episode of Friends a number of times we still didn't know all the answers!  Really good fun."
18058,5540,5," this game is alot of fun and good value for money. we didn't have to wait long for it to arrive either"
18059,5540,4," My teenage son watches Friends constantly"
18060,5540,5," I found this game really fun to play. There are two DVD-related parts& one for anyone for answer and one for just whoever's go it is. There are lots of trivia questions as well& and Buzz cards& which are like 'Chance' cards in Monopoly. It's a good laugh& and tests just how much you know about Friends! Me and my friends enjoyed it a lot& and I would definitly recommend it!"
18061,5540,5," I bought this for my daughter (14 yrs) who is a true fanatic of Friends and has seen every episode several times (too much tele I think!)We have all played it and she regularly plays this game with her friends. It's not too long so doesn't get boring but is difficult when you haven't seen as many episodes as every one else.Becomes very competitive and addictive"
18062,5540,5," this game was easy to set up and understand& great fun for all friends fans& can play time and time again. Highly recommended."
18063,5540,4," I got this for a christmas present and it's had great reviews. A great nights fun with food and friends."
18064,5541,5," Great fun& even the most devoted south park fans can enjoy this and be challenged by some questions. Good variety and the playing card aspect is a nice touch. However& there is nothing in the instructions about when to discard& this meant we had to create our own rules"
18065,5541,5," Loved by all our family& quite easy to understand once you get going& only play if your a real south park fan and have watched a lot of episodes& family and friends love this game"
18066,5541,5," Bought or a big fan& who has numerous toys&figures"
18067,5542,5," I discovered the smaller puzzle set when travelling in New Zealand and& after an evening playing it& I had to go out and buy the full set.  Very addictive and an ideal travel game for those rainy days.  The only problem I found was that it was incompatible with any form of alcohol consumption: you really need to be able to think ahead!"
18068,5542,5," The aim of this game is simple: to make a longer closed loop than your opponent. It uses a set of hexagonal tiles& each with line fragments of three of the four possible colours. If you place the tiles right and plan the order you place them in& you are able to make forced moves to create ever-longer lines. The winner is the person with the single longest continuous line at the end of the game. If you manage to close the line to make a loop& you score double& so you have to be careful to watch what your opponent is doing.Every tile is unique& so you have to watch which tiles have been played and therefore work out what is still to come and whether you will be able to find the tiles you need.This is essentially an extremely simple game with very few rules& so may be learnt by even young children. Like all great games& though& real skill is needed to play at the very highest level. If you can't find a person to play with you face to face& you can visit the tantrix.com website and play against both robots and other people.As a solitaire& it is a great 2D spatial challenge.It's one of the few strategy type games of this sort that I have played over a number of years and still find absorbing."
18069,5542,4," My sister-in-law gave me the starter set for Christmas.  I was so addicted that I rushed out and bought the full set.  The solo puzzles are great fun and certain of my friends got very competitive in trying to complete the challenges with more and more tiles.  My children (3 and 5) have made up their own games as well as tackling the simpler solo puzzles.It's portable& the bakelite tiles are pleasingly tactile& and you can even make pretty patterns.  Oh and if you're as sad as me there is even a web site ([...]) from which I've just learnt that there will be an International Festival of Tantrix in Spain in July 2005.  Where's my passport?"
18070,5542,5," I am a childminder and a home educator and this game is ticking boxes all over the shop.It is a game that is suitable for my 3yr old minded child and 5yr old son to play together with supervision.  We keep it simple and the aim is for them to make a long line or loops.  Excellent for colour recognition for the 3yr old and learning to take turns and beginning to understand very simply strategy.For my son& it is great as a game and an educational tool.  He is learning strategy& gamemanship& taking turns& working out scores& seeing and creating patterns.As a parent/minder I am chuffed to bits because this game has come in a small carry bag which means it's very portable.  I have just taken the game out with me& as I had to go to a garage for my car.  I played the game with the kids while the car was looked at.  It kept them nicely occupied and the trip was not at all stressful.This is also a game that will grow with my son and will become more challenging as he gets older.I thoroughly recommend."
18071,5542,5," Having played with a borrowed Tantrix set on 2 evenings a year apart& I decided I needed to get my own set.I have only played the solo versions of the game.But I think its far more fun than my Nintendo DS braintraining software - plus it has not batteries to run out.The pieces are very tactile.A lovely game"
18072,5542,4," Tantrix is a good game for all ages. all the kids had a go. its the sort of thing that is always around and gets picked up every now and then"
18073,5542,5," Bought this several years ago when the kids were quite young. Now they are 14 and 16 it is still challenging as there are no fixed answers to the puzzles. You can play it on your own or as a multi player game. It is just as challenging for adults. We leave ours in the car and when the DS is played out the tantrix comes out. It is well made and has a quality bag."
18074,5542,5," Loved this. I bought the discovery puzzle (which is also great if you want a taster). I have been recommending it to lots of people and even bought it for my Dad at Christams.If you like puzzles and brainteasers or logic puzzles and pattern or computational based games you will LOVE this."
18075,5543,5," Brilliant for our dementia support group. Nice and big to see and handle. Only problem is that the pale colours are less easy to see for those with failing eyesight."
18076,5543,2," remember to check the sizes of these and don't read them in inches like i did!!"
18077,5543,5," Very good for floor games for the elderly and people living with dementia.."
18078,5543,5," great for the garden and school playground"
18079,5543,4," Good"
18080,5544,5," This is a fine set of dominoes: great for introducing children to the game& as the coloured dots are more visually appealing to youngsters and make the numbers easier to read"
18081,5544,5," Dominoes is a wonderful entertaining and educational game for the whole family.  This set has incredibly sturdy pieces& and comes with its own storage tin& which unlike a cardboard container& will last for ages.  A great buy!"
18082,5544,5," Lovely quality& durable& educational& portable. Coloured spots mean younger children can play by numbers or colours. You can't do this with plain old black and white. We have also invested in 9 spots version."
18083,5544,4," Great set of dominoes. Great for playing the basic game& or for teaching numbers or just for toppling over! The colours for each number is great for teaching my toddler but the pieces are sturdy enough for an adult game. Comes with a huge set of instructions for loads more games that can be played with dominoes other than basic matching. A good purchase."
18084,5544,5," Good quality even though was not new. The product was as described& just a slight scratch on tin. Really good price was very pleased as I struggled to find this product anywhere else. It was at least twice as much.  Arrived quickly."
18085,5544,5," We purchased these for our grand-daughter& who thinks they are great fun and they get a lot of use. We and her parents feel that these dominoes are helping to further her learning to count."
18086,5544,1," Really disappointed with quality of this set. Falling apart already and have not even used them.I will have to buy another set... From another make"
18087,5544,5," Great for small hands& bought for disabled daughter& they are large with bright colourful dots which are easy to see& would recommend."
18088,5545,5," Bought this for our holidays with friends .would recommend it &we had hours of fun easy to play ."
18089,5545,4," quick delivery and as description on website"
18090,5545,5," good game for all ages good quality love it"
18091,5545,5," Great game for all the family"
18092,5545,5," I have had this game for many years& but now find my grandchildren arguing over who should have my game. The simplest answer came in buying three more games  so that I could give them one each.  The new cost was too expensive to consider& so this was a perfect choice."
18093,5546,5," Somewhere along the way we'd lost a set of dominoes that had survived the air raid shelters of the Second World War and subsequently& in the 1960's& entertained a second generation.So& when this year's summer failed abysmally to arrive - and with television channels carrying their usual uninteresting mixture of dross and rubbish - we decided on a 'back-to-the-past' approach.Thus the traditional dominoes. Inexpensive& well made& well packed and with excellent delivery they've already happily helped while away a few hours."
18094,5546,3," Reasonable value for the price charged"
18095,5546,5," I ordered these dominoes for my grandkids to use when they visit. They were very cheap but the actual dominoes are okay. The packaging however will not last long as it is just cardboard. This is not a fault of the seller& I should have read the description more carefully and I would have realised. All in all a good wee item at a good price"
18096,5546,4," To call them 'Deluxe' is stretching the truth a bit. These dominoes were a little smaller than I expected them to be - and there was a bit of variation in the size of individual dominoes in the box& but when they are as cheap as these (and no doubt the children will lose some of them within the next couple of weeks anyway!)& it's not a problem.  Quick Delivery."
18097,5546,5," This is a basic game good for children or beginners.  I wasn't sure what to expect and didn't want to spend a lot of money if I didn't like to play dominoes.  This was good value for the money.  However if you really want to  play dominoes I would purchase a larger set."
18098,5546,3," Cheap dominos...same as what you would get in the poundshop(if they stock them).You would have to pay more if you want |deluxe| dominos."
18099,5546,4," Fine for the cost&sturdy but the dots area a bit blurred. Kids don't notice. The company was very helpful about sending an invoice when I needed one."
18100,5546,4," There were bought for one of the kids at the youth club and she loved them and now interacts challenging people to play"
18101,5547,5," friends scene it was the best scene it game i have played with my daughter and it is a great way to learn more about friends and i would defiantly recommend this game to friend viewer and game fans ."
18102,5548,5," A very happy neice - Thank you"
18103,5549,5," The game is suitable for all ages of Twilight fans& it does not drag on and has a good variety of questions and options for questions. Family love it."
18104,5549,2," I bought this for myself and my daughter to play this xmas as we are big twilight fans. I think the board needed to be longer as i had won within 10 mins and the game was over. I think the challenges could have been a bit more challenging. Maybe my expectations were too high. Its good if u like games that dont last long!"
18105,5549,5," I am so glad to find this gift for one of our grandchildren"
18106,5549,4," Bought this for my daughter who is a big Twilight fan... only to then find out that her boyfriend already bought it for her. But I didn't even have to send it back as my friend bought it off me for her daughter - it's very popular it seems.."
18107,5550,5," lovely for little girls for christmas"
18108,5551,5," This product was fantastic& great price and arrived very quickly. I am extremely happy with this and me and the kids have lots of fun with it"
18109,5551,3," my son had lots of fun with this game lots of questions and its a game he whole family can join in with"
18110,5551,5," Great gift for my grandson good price"
18111,5551,4," Xmas present well received"
18112,5551,5," Very good for footie fans"
18113,5552,5," Excellent& good quality and longer than ones I have used before.  Very please :)"
18114,5552,5," Item as described very pleased with it"
18115,5552,5," Very handy for marshalling your tiles"
18116,5552,3," Slightly too small for my x15 domino set. The slot is too narrow and deep"
18117,5553,5," Bought this on impulse for the family to play on a very rainy day ... even the youngest member was riveted for a couple of hours.  The dvd interaction is a really good twist on this classic game. Basically played out as normal but with 2 dice& one has a TV moniter icon on one side .. if you throw this you go to the dvd for instuctions .. lots of changes (for the better) like weather conditions affecting the amount of rent you pay.  Set out as a paradise island& you can buy piers& restaraunts& casinos as well as the usual. When you land on someone else's property you go to the dvd to tell you how much rent to pay .. sometimes it can be nothing when in the old version you would be bankrupt for certain!!!  Few rule changes make the game go at a better pace& and also each player adopts a character who has special priveledges and advantages.  Great fun& we all laughed at the tv news excerpts!!  Go on& buy it& promise you will love it."
18118,5553,3," I was dissapointed in this version of Monopoly. It has so many parts that you can guarantee something is going to go missing. Go for the Monopoly Revolution& its much better."
18119,5553,5," fab"
18120,5554,4," My son (age 12) got this for his birthday and it's a fun& original game. One really good thing about it is that you know exactly how long it's going to take (three quarters of an hour). You put the DVD in your player and then the wrinkly old Gatekeeper takes over& ordering you what to do (and you'd better do as he says or you'll be in trouble). The rules are on the DVD too& which is very useful as it shows you clearly how to play. You have to move around the board collecting coloured keys and from time to time the Gatekeeper interrupts with a challenge. There are also cards that have to played at certain times (for example when there are 30 minutes left on the clock). Towards the end of the game there can be a whole frenzy of card playing and Gatekeeper challenges. We played this game with 4 boys aged 12& 12& 9 and 8 and nobody had nightmares. It's not really very scary - but the Gatekeeper as well as being very wrinkly is very rude and likes to call everyone 'maggot'. You have been warned!"
18121,5554,5," It is a very good game. Can be quite scary but at the same time it is very funny. You have to beat the gatekeeper to win and it is brilliant competeing against one another to beat him. Also getting revenge on people who have anoyed you in this game is good. a good laugh and you will want to play it again and again because it is different each time and scenes are selected randomly for a different effect of the game"
18122,5554,4," I played the original a lot when I was a kid and I was excited to see that it was remade. The dvd adds for some variation and apart from the intro sequence I have not seen the same stuff come up too often. I've played it around four times so far and I always enjoy it. The board looks better than the original and the effort put into the design of the dvd and the board game is really good. The game changes in difficulty based upon how many people are playing& if there are only two of you then it would be too easy. The game recommends a minimum of three players anyway. My only criticism is that the time cards are so dependent on when you pick them up and I don't find they enter the game too often and end up being discarded. It's a great game for Hallowe'en"
18123,5554,4," really good game to play for an hour...the more people you have playing the better it is! you feel like such an idiot talking into a tv but its all in good fun!definatley worth investing in or playing because its a real laugh with friendsideal for halloween!"
18124,5554,5," this game is great if you get your friends round for drinks and turn the lights off just so the light off the tv covers the board& quite a fun game& can be a bit of a hassle to set up and tidy up but what game isint. recomend it if your up for a laugh with mates"
18125,5554,5," This was recommended to us from a friend& and we sampled a clip of it on tube before buying. It is so funny - if you dot mind being insulted by a board game. It's best for slightly older kids 10+/teenagers will love it and adults."
18126,5554,5," Loved this game when I was a teen& thought it would be good for Halloween. We play it every year. Excellent condition when sent. Arrived quickly. Fun for teens and over as quite a complex game with a lot of rules."
18127,5554,4," once i figure out how to play& im sure it'll be great! i remember it from my childhood and it always looked fun. the dvd is more variable than the ond vhs& now things happen at random - adds to the replay"
18128,5555,5," This game lasts as long as you want it to. It is taking the USA by storm. It is fun and frustrating! Involves skill and luck. The main Mexican train game can even be played on computer if you register online and pay a fee.  suits all ages from about 7 up& though my 5 year thoroughly enjoyed it& she needed some help.  Would recommend it to anyone with either a big enough table to fit the dominoes on & or a big enough floor space and no one with arthritus! Fabulous family game"
18129,5555,5," We discovered this game whilst staying with friends in the USA over Thanksgiving.  Since then we have introduced it to friends at home with amazing results.  People who do not normally like to play games absolutely love it& they love the feel and the sound of the tiles and they love the fact that all the age groups can have fun together."
18130,5555,5," Not your traditional Dominos. There are lots of games you can play. Mexican train seems to be the best for our family. Its competitive and fun and it requires thought and some strategy but easy for the kids to master. Then you have to add up all the points at the end.We keep the tally of points in a book and take it in turns to update it.Genuine excitement when we all sit down to play."
18131,5555,3," Unfortunately I am somewhat disappointed with the quality of these dominoes. I did a bit of research and decided to buy this double 12 set based on the largely positive previous reviews and predominantly intended to use them to play Mexican train (hence the accessories). Everything was present (inc. the plastic station hub and 4 train markers) and the dominoes were complete and shrink-wrapped. However& a couple of dominoes have chips / damage to the back and quite a number appear to be of a slightly different colour (more ivory rather than off-white). A couple are also slightly thicker / thinner than the majority and a few have slightly poor paint spots (although this is just cosmetic). At the end of the day& I did not expect perfect tournament quality dominoes& so I can live with imperfections on the faces& but I am not happy about the ability to potentially identify dominoes due to the damage& colour& marks or size discrepancies. I'll be contacting the supplier for a refund."
18132,5555,3," I love this game and recommend it very highly. You and up to 7 friends can play a variety of games with this domino set and it requires some amount of strategy and thought - but is still just a lot of fun.The down side for this product is that the dots began to fall out of the dimples from the very first time we played - I was very disappointed with this as it was a gift to a friend."
18133,5555,5," This is a great game for all ages and up to ten people can play. The Grandchildren enjoy playing and I also play with a group of pensioners at a community centre. it is a game that can bring friends together and at somewhere like a community centre a way of making new friends."
18134,5555,5," We were introduced to the game in the USA where I'm told it is popular. We brought one back and have played it with friends and relatives who have all gone on to buy it for themselves and for other friends and relatives. That says it all& really."
18135,5555,5," I can quite categorically say that this was a great purchase..suitable for all ages& and from two to eight people can have a great time.There are not to many rules to confuse...and it is far superior to straight dominoes."
18136,5556,5," Splendid"
18137,5557,5," Dominoes as described& kids will have hours of fun outside with them....as will the adults no doubt& looking forward to a few games on Xmas day!!"
18138,5557,4," Fun!  Great for the garden& or for the kids club.  Not for really little ones& as the foam breaks down"
18139,5557,5," Well appreciated by a family who love to play all kinds of games in the garden."
18140,5557,4," Great for the grandchildren"
18141,5558,5," Love this game!! great quality !"
18142,5559,5," This is a really well made toy. Little one is 3 and really enjoys the game."
18143,5559,5," My son loved this and plays for hours& the blocks are nice and colourful."
18144,5560,4," I'm not a fan of drinking from plastic vessels (particularly alcohol) and the quality of these novelty folding glasses is usually poor. However though the actual 'glass' could be stronger grade plastic this is an above average version of the concept.  The translucent folding glass comes supplied in a sturdy translucent cub complete with a bottle opener mounted in the lid. Handy little gadget. Just resist temptation to start folding the 'glass' when full of quality ale!"
18145,5561,5," Better gameplay options than the original Disney Scene It. And with more clips from the modern Disney and Pixar films& your kids will have a real chance to win."
18146,5561,5," Bought this for Christmas for the children and played it for the first time last Friday& second time on Saturday and if they had their way& would be playing it constantly.  Youngest at age 3 is probably a bit too young& although he did answer some questions& but the other children at ages 7&12"
18147,5561,2," I am an avid fan of scene it and I have a collection of at least 6 of it's titles (particularly the Friends and Harry Potter ones) but I was very disappointed with this particlar title. My main issue was that the dvd only played Toy Story and Bugs Life clips during a My Play which made it very boring rather than a wide varitey of movie clips as in the Comedy Movies title. The Card questions however are very well done and the little characters are very sweet. I just wish the dvd was of better mix. Perhaps the Disney Duluxe game has a better aray of movies."
18148,5561,3," My kids love this game but as other people say it does need more variety of film clips ours tends to just be about up and ratatouille which gets boring for us adults after a while"
18149,5562,4," I bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter because it looked fun and easily adaptable for her age. Excellent game for children& and not boring for adults. I would have given it 5 stars except that the faces are stuck on with pieces of paper which don't always fit properly& and stick over the edge on some. I am not sure how long it will last before the faces peel off or damage. Nonetheless a great game and I would still recommend it."
18150,5562,5," Great game for all ages over 4. We adapted rules so adults play to one set of rules and children another& at the same time. Very pleased and NO BATTERIES READ. .."
18151,5563,5," The dominoes are brightly coloured and have been used a lot but show no signs of wear. They have been knocked off tables& stood on and even thrown around but not one domino is damaged. The colours are still clear and even the storage jar is still fine. No complaints at all. Plenty of games can be played with these& from maths games to traditional domino structures to be knocked over."
18152,5563,5," This set is great fun"
18153,5563,5," great product"
18154,5564,4," kids love it"
18155,5565,5," Bought as an Xmas gift so not opened but box containing the dominoes looks the part"
18156,5566,4," My son (age 12) has been mesmerised by this hobby. The blocks stand up well and are nicely coloured. Need more pieces!"
18157,5566,4," These were a Xmas present for my 6 year old. After his initial confusion over the fact this toy didn't require batteries (!)& and once he'd been shown the fun and excitement by the grown ups& he saw the fun in these colourful retro dominoes. Now he and his sister (aged 8) create all sorts of runs with them and are getting quite creative. It has lost one star due to the chime not really making any sort of noise when the last domino falls on to it. A great toy for all ages!"
18158,5566,5," We bought this for Christmas for our 6yr old Granddaughter as she had asked for it. It's got loads of dominoes and other bits for building. I have played with it with her and she can stand the dominoes up no problem& of course you have to be careful not to knock them down before you have finished building your layout& this happened a few times but we got there in the end."
18159,5566,3," Bought this as a desperate last minute xmas present for a small child. There are dozens of dominoes and quite a lot of obstacles for the child to play with. I was not overly impressed with the packaging and there could have been more instructions given the steep price which I thought was a bit over the top& hence the 3 stars."
18160,5566,5," very happy with the cost and speed of delivery& would recomend company again& happy& joyful& happy and triumphant& thankyou very much& item came very quickly and was in good condition& will make a welcome present under the xmas tree"
18161,5567,4," Great product - hours of fun for my 3 and 6 year old - can play this one on their own.  Would highly recommend them"
18162,5567,5," The dominoes are really durable as they're thick plastic. The peppa pig pictures are bright and colourful& great way to get the concept of dominoes before introducing numbered ones."
18163,5567,4," Modern twist on the old classic game.  For a |Peppa Pig mad| youngster this game went down a storm as a Christmas present. Very reasonably priced too."
18164,5567,4," I bought these for my 21/2 year old grand daughter who loves any thing Peppa . She has grasped the idea of placing each tile against one with the same picture and loves finding the right tile.Her concentration only lasts for one game at a time but as the tiles are made of durable plastic they will last until she is able to concentrate on more than one game."
18165,5567,5," I saw these in a shop but the price was expensive so checked Amazon and the price was Excellent.I got these for my Grandaughter who is 3 yrs old and she loves them we play all kind of games with them and its helping with her counting as we count how many peepa's there are and how many candy cat's etc.They are a must for all little Peppa fans my Grandaughter enjoys playing with them all the time."
18166,5567,5," My daughter recieved this as a birthday gift and i was pleased with it so bought it for one of her friends birthdays! A nice item that allows family time to play together. Plastic dominoes that come in a nice box& would have loved it even more if they were wooden dominoes."
18167,5567,5," Brilliant my 2.5 year old loves this and so do we as a family.  Short games so holds attention and she adores Peppa Pig so a winner all round...."
18168,5567,5," My grandaughter has just turned 3 and this is an ideal game for her to take part in a family game together.  She just loves it as she knows all the names of the Peppa Pig family&  unlike me.  It is also small enough to take with you when you go out.  I first saw a family playing with this when I was on a cruise recently and thought our grandaughter would love this."
18169,5568,5," If you love twilight then this is a good game. Loved it"
18170,5569,4," I bought this game for a lad of 5 who has just discovered the joy of Dominoes and he has been busy for hours making different 'rallies' and layouts using all the added steps& etc included in the set. I would recommend this toy as an alternative to just sitting in front of the TV or Xbox as it encourages creativity and patience and concentration and of course great satisfaction when the Dominoes fall down in a cascade as hoped!"
18171,5569,5," One of the few toys that hold the attention of all ages.  Adults think they aren't interested in dominos until they watch a 5 year old setting them up and then they just have to get involved.  They start taking over the design and everyone wants to be the one to start the knock down.This is a lovely set. The right amount of dominoes& enough to build a decent size course but also to pack away small enough to store easily.  Well cut wooden dominos.  A handful of trick pieces& like bridge and chime etc.helpful hint. . .when setting up with small children best to leave a gap every ten dominos or so until you are ready to knock down& saves on tears when they accidently knock them over.would certainly be happy to buy this again as gift for another child.5*"
18172,5569,4," Bought this game for my kids . Provides endless hours of fun for them . It is one of those toys that keeps coming out of the toybox all the while"
18173,5569,5," Fab product. Domino are a good size and easy to stand up. My 7 year old loves them. :-)and so do I."
18174,5569,3," My grandson and I have had fun building various domino runs& but the quality of the tiles is poor& with some tiles not cut straight. Very frustrating especially as an uneven tile set off the run before completing! The tiles are just a little too thin and light. Once we realised the limitations& we adapted by getting rid of any dodgy tiles!"
18175,5569,1," We are great fans of wooden and toys for our children. But this kit is so poorly made that our children are not interested to play with it. Some of the domino pieces were not even solid wood and snapped in half easily. The contraptions are flimsy and so not stay together and the stairs were not designed accurately for the domino effect to work well. the bell is a metal tube made of inappropriate material& just some cheap metal tube that makes no sound when hit by a piece of domino or anything else for that matter. We are too late to return this piece of cheaply made rubbish kit& so Â£16 wasted. I had better kits of Domino when I was a child& some 20 years ago. I would recommend you don't waste your money on this& look elsewhere if you want you children to enjoy it."
18176,5569,4," This is a brilliant toy& it kept my little cousin Robin entertained for hours! The only downside was that he had trouble setting it up without help - he'd get so far before the few dominos that he had put up fell down before he finished the rest!!"
18177,5569,4," Only gets 4 stars as it is time consuming setting up and tedious in the extreme when you get a premature knock-down"
18178,5570,5," These are the iPod of dominoes - superbly tactile and pleasant in the hand& perfectly weighted and lovely to play with. The spinners (brass buttons on the top side) make them slide well in the mix and complete a first class product. Everyone should own a set of dominoes and these will last a lifetime."
18179,5570,5," My friend brought these to the pub one day& Iâ€™ve totally forgotten how much fun an old-school game of dominoes is!I recommend this set of Dominoes in particular& because they are really good quality. They feel good (the material theyâ€™re made of as well as their weight) and have those spinners that make them move easily on the table.Doesnâ€™t matter if you spill some beer over them& they are waterproof/washable. Very pleased with them myself."
18180,5570,4," Sick to death of rubbish TV so getting pals interested in Crib and dominoes. Round for a bit to eat& a couple of beers and a game of cards - just like the |Old Days|Goods arrived in good time& well packed and at a sensible price.  Would recommend and would buy form them again."
18181,5570,5," These are quality dominoes.  They are solid and chunky and the metal stud (spinner) helps with shuffling and picking up.If you want dominoes to topple these are not the ones.  They are quite thick compared with ordinary wooden ones and play better if you stand them up on edge rather than try and hold them in your hand.Definitely a 5* product packed in a plastic box (like the old wooden boxes) and usefully includes a set of games instructions.Don't buy cheaper ones."
18182,5570,5," Exactly what I was looking for. Didn't know much about dominoes but now I understand what |spinners| mean"
18183,5570,5," Excellent. Great for adults& don't have to worry about trying to hold them.  Got spines&  and is great for slamming."
18184,5570,5," the box is plastic which is a great shame as the dominoes are good quality and I had thought it would be a wooden box which would have made the whole thing more classy"
18185,5570,5," Loved playing dominoes when I was younger with my family. Had to buy this to teach my partner how to play so that we could beat his dad at it lol"
18186,5571,4," My 4 year old loves this stocking filler. Small and easily transported& the wood is well finished and it seems to be hard wearing!Thanks&"
18187,5571,5," A much used game used during travel and dining out"
18188,5572,5," These dalmation dominoes are a hit with our 4yr old granddaughter& they are dominoes& pets& Disney story characters and counting aids plus many more things& great toy. She is a little confused why the double blank puppy has no spots!"
18189,5572,4," This is a durable and clever game  toy for teaching and using numbers. The 'dogs'  all carry  a different numbers of spots and can be stood upright to hide the spots from the other players&good fun."
18190,5572,4," My young grandchildren loved this game& they really liked the little dalmation design dominoes. It's educational too& may help young children with their understanding of numbers."
18191,5572,5," Bought these for my daughters 6th birthday as she is dalmatian mad! She loves them! We have actually played dominoes with them though I often find them playing in her dolls house too!"
18192,5572,5," Bought as a gift for a dalmatian owner.  It is well made& the dogs are so cute.  Very tactile."
18193,5573,5," I bought this game to take to the US as a Christmas present for my 3 year old great-nephew. I had also bought 'The Gruffalo' book.He loves the game although we had to 'adapt' the rules slightly as he is still a bit young to fully grasp the dominoes concept but we had great fun and it definitely helped his counting skills. I can see this game being used for a long time as 'The Gruffalo' was not something they had seen in the US and the book became his immediate favourite.The cards seem very durable and I was very pleased to have chosen this game as all the characters on the dominoes are from the book which made it immediately appealing.A great pre-school and later educational toy!"
18194,5573,5," Bought these for my 4 year old to help with numbers and he loves this game& his little sister is not as keen and just throws the cards about! Better for when they are older and the pictures from the gruff also are really nice& would recommend."
18195,5573,5," Excellent  product. I used them for a maths activity and the children loved them."
18196,5574,5," Grandson loved it"
18197,5575,5," This 2-figure set is& perhaps& the best of the mini-statues offered by Schleich. You get Superman and Darkseid - and both look great& especially Darkseid.The level of detail is quite amazing. Several of the figures in this line don't look anywhere near as good.These are very tiny - at just 4| tall& on their base. They're hand-painted& so I suppose each one is slightly different.There is no articulation& and I don't think these are suitable for kids (too small and easily breakable). But for adult collectors& this is a nice item. The display box adds to it."
18198,5575,5," Bought this for my 3 year old grandson& he loves his figures& its like having a kid on crack& he's obsessed with figures& mind you I used to be when I was a younger man& my figures used to walk into a pub on their own though. not a bad price& he's happy with them& came before time. good value for what they are and the pleasure it gives him."
18199,5575,5," Extremely happy"
18200,5576,4," Our son is mad on Thundercats& so he has most of this 'smaller' sized range"
18201,5576,4," Good figure. Nicely stylised. But why does Cheetara have detachable limbs?!? I bought this for my daughter who promptly lost an arm on the way back from the post office (later recovered)."
18202,5576,4," I bought this figure for my partner as he is a collector of thundercats was a little dissapointed coz it wasnt the old figures it neva said but was happy with the prompt service"
18203,5577,5," Bought as a gift for my husband as he is a big Game of thrones fan& and he loves it. Well made and looks great and packaging was great too."
18204,5578,5," Having collected a few original SW figures over the years (including a 1977 Darth Vader my parents found in a pond!) but having had to give up due to unemployment etc& I thought i'd get back into it with this classic figure. Biggs Darklighter is a name well known to Star Wars fans-he is a friend of Lukes on Tatooine who joins the Imperial Academy and then defects to the Rebellion. He participated in the Rebel assault on the first Death Star& where he was killed by Darth Vader in the famous 'trench run' sequence. This figure has all the right bits in the right places& from the shiny black leather on the boots and gloves to the cut of the flight suit. The detailing on the helmet and life-support gear is exceptional& with Biggs' helmet art faithfully recreated in minature. All in all a wonderful piece for the collector...and maybe the kids too!I have just two minor niggles...the first being the pose-which& if you match all the lines up& 'locks' him into that position and no other (he also looks a tad 'camp' when viewed from certain angles!)& and the second being his pistol-if you take the gummy band off to remove it& you WILL lose it. It is so small and delicate that it's best to touch it as little as possible.Other than those small gripes it's a very well made figure and stays faithful to both the story and the character."
18205,5578,5," Hasbro's second wave for the 30th Anniversary includes this brilliant figure of Luke's friend and fellow Red Squadron pilot& Biggs Darklighter. The last time this was released was way back in 1998 in the very rare penultimate wave on the Kenner label and this issue is a great improvement over its predecessor.Collectors will recognise the body of the figure as the same one used for Dutch Vander (Saga 2004 #13) and also for Wedge Antilles (Star Wars Shop exclusive 2005) but resculpted with Biggs' head.The figure is not as poseable as others in this wave with the legs set in one stance. The arms are quite set as well with only joints in the elbow and shoulder. However& the face sculpt is an excellent likeness and much better than the '98 version.Biggs comes equipped with a DL-17 blaster and his Red 3 flight helmet.The figure also comes with a silver coin which is for the album that comes with figure #1: Darth Vader.A great figure and a must for all those who want the complete Red Squadron!"
18206,5579,5," I can't describe my enthusiasm when I opened the package. The sword came inside in an extremely protective package. The quality of sword and it's base is perfect. The blade is crafted from stainless steel but not sharp - it's a decorative sword - (You can check if is stainless steel by dropping water. The water doesn't stay it slides away.).The handle it's not wooden but metallic but believe me if you do not touch it you will not realize it. If you are a devotee of the movies& it worths its money& undoubtedly. In a few days I will upload some photos of it to show you how is in reality."
18207,5579,5," This sword is amazing& well worth the money& it's great quality and looks great on my wall. The blade is surprisingly heavy& and isn't the easiest to wield one handed. Now just waiting for the scabbard to become available."
18208,5579,5," Great replica& it has the feel and the look of the sword used in the filmMy only slight complaint is that the handle is made of metal instead of wood/resin. It's not a big deal it's just my personal Peeve."
18209,5579,3," As an avid collector of replica Lord of the Rings blades& I was eager to add this sword to my collection.All my other pieces are United Cutlery& anyone who has held one of their blades knows the high quality to which they are manufactured. This was my first time visiting the Noble Collection and sadly it will be my last.I appreciate this product has at present& eighteen 5 star reviews and I hate being the first to ruin that& but I have to be honest in my review.I was initially impressed with the sword& the scale is spot on& the weight is reassuring& it's actually very heavy given it's size. The Elvish scroll on the blade is beautiful and the handle as others have commented isn't wood& but feels great to hold. It was a dull afternoon when it arrived so when I turned on some bright lights to really appreciate it& that's where disappointment set in.I have six other officially licenced LOTR replica swords& so the expectation was high& but the quality of the blade really let me down. The blade was dull& had a less than subtle brush like pattern along its whole length and small black marks that were hard to miss.A faint brown smudge at the widest point of the blade and I was wrapping it back up to be returned. A Made in China sticker didn't help improve my confidence.I can't even review the stand& I never looked at it.The seller was great and my refund is on the way& I can't fault them in anyway. Maybe I'm to picky for my own good& but when I spend that sort of money on a replica& that so many had raved about (Including a walk in store that had sung it's praises) I expect much better."
18210,5579,5," Truely stunning& Great quality& Better than I expected!The actor who uses this in the film said it was heavy... He wasn't joking.Worth EVERY penny!"
18211,5579,5," Bought this for my teenage son who absolutely loved it.  The weight of the sword was surprisingly heavy - very authentic - and the detail is amazing.  A fantastic collector's item!"
18212,5579,5," This sword is stunning! It is beautifully crafted and intricately detailed. The handle is also stainless steel which makes the sword very heavy but the weapon is still balanced. I say weapon because though the blade edge is dull the tip is entirely capable of piercing soft tissue (partly because of the solid steel"
18213,5579,5," Quality sword. Blunt edge but fairly heavy. Speedy delivery. Even comes with a stand for to hang on the wall."
18214,5580,5," Great figure for a collection& it will stand out due to it being metallic. Even though the price is a bit steep& it still worth buying as it is a Comicon exclusive."
18215,5580,5," Really stands out from the crowd. Its right in the middle of my collection as its my favorite. Thanks!"
18216,5580,5," Came quick was no damage to the item"
18217,5580,5," Brought as a gift& recipient happy"
18218,5581,5," This pen is beautiful!! I have been a die-hard Harry Potter fan since my mum began reading the first book to me when I was ten-years-old. Now& fourteen years& six books and eight films later& I am still mad about anything to do with Jo Rowling's world of magic! Gryffindor is my favourite house - OBVIOUSLY!!! This pen not only looks amazing& it is also wonderful to write with. May look into getting some of the others!! Thank you Amazon!! :D"
18219,5581,5," Looks awesome. Great packaging. Fantastic buy. :) :) :) :) :)"
18220,5581,5," Brought these for my daughters birthday but i ordered them only a few days before her birthday i didnt think they would be here on time....but they arrived look amazing and i have a very happy birthday girl with her hogwarts pens. Thank you"
18221,5581,5," Every young Harry Potters essential accessory. Daughter loves it."
18222,5581,5," Very happy little boy :)"
18223,5582,5," A brilliant gift for any HP fan. A quality product."
18224,5583,5," Great for Star Wars fans with the usual quality of Crayola"
18225,5584,5," This is by far the highest quality wand replica from the Noble collection. It isn't as thin and flimsy as the others with a decent weight the handle is beautifully twisted and sculpted with a fine polish all over. You can really see where the darker brown gently fades lighter without blunt paint stains. The pictures do not do it any justice and I will be posting my own images to show you.Arrives beautifully presented in a long padded box& be careful you don't yank it out and break it as it is still very fragile.THIS IS NOT A TOY& on the side of the box as with most of them it comes with a `14+ years age written on it as this is a Noble Collection movie prop replica made from resin and some are made from wood& they are not durable and will shatter if dropped or tapped against a wall& you could snap them with your hands so these are not for children.I can't recommend this wand enough it is beautiful& the Noble Collection seller also does as described and usually ships one day earlier than said."
18226,5584,5," I bought this as an early Christmas gift for a friend who lives quite far away. When I recieved it& it was well packaged& and the product itself looks wonderful. I sent it to her and she's already opened it although she knew what it was& and she adores it& it's already been shown off to everyone at her college and it's got pride of place in her room now where it's being kept safe.It's great :)"
18227,5584,5," This is the 1st wand for my fiance's collection and she couldn't be happier with it. She is looking forward to getting the complete collection from you."
18228,5584,5," The wand is fantastic& very elegant& and with the appropiate size for your hand. Every fan of Harry Potter deserve this wand as a gift!!!"
18229,5584,5," This wand was incredible! It did not snap or break it was beautifully crafted and definitely worth the buy& awesome!"
18230,5584,5," Although it is quite pricey it is soo awesome. It is made from real wood and comes in a lovely display case. I bought it for a friend and loved it so much that it was very difficult to let go (I did do a quick swich and flick before I handed it over). An excellent present for any Harry Potter fan. And delivery was very good and quick."
18231,5584,5," This is a great wand! It's a great size& lovely brown colours and very cool to hold! One of the best noble collection wands."
18232,5584,5," This was a gift for my son to add to his collection !! &  he loved it very happy with it"
18233,5585,5," Excellent product& well presented and packaged"
18234,5586,5," good"
18235,5587,5," This is a quality figure& its literally a mini Bane& the likeness is amazing for a 1/6th scale figure& the detail from the mask to the clothes is screen acurate. A must have"
18236,5587,5," Very happy with JHS service and figure looks great!"
18237,5587,5," Happy with product and services..."
18238,5587,5," Awfully big guy& fantastic"
18239,5588,5," Quick delivery. Feels a bit plastics but that's good for outdoors. Helped me find my tent at Silverstone. Also& where's your flag& peasant?!"
18240,5588,5," i have this draped above my sword rack and it looks fantastic im so happy they didn't put a massive game of thrones sign on it."
18241,5588,5," True to description and delivered quickly.  Good value"
18242,5589,5," i am a hgue fan of halo& and these figures are just amazing& you really cant appreciate them until you have one infrontof you& the detail is breathtaking& and the articulation is like no other figure i have& you can get them into great poses& they each come with accessories& the gun& a frag granade& and a spare pair of hands& if you are a halo fan& or a figure collector& i would highly recommend you buy one& it is well worth the price tag& and you will not be dissappointed :)"
18243,5589,2," We bought two of these for our kids and I'm sorry to say that& although they look absolutely fantastic and are beautifully realised& as others have said here the ball-joints for the legs become incredibly loose within 24-hours of coming out of the box and quickly get to the point where they fall off whenever you try to pose the figures.It's a real shame and the kids now leave these great-looking and very expensive figures lying around in pieces instead of playing with them as we intended.If you are buying this to display it then go ahead. If you want it to play or interact with at all then do not buy it."
18244,5589,4," great price for the figure& definatley would not have payed full price for this. My only concern with the production of the figure is the ball joints on the legs are rather loose which makes it diffictut to position in poses. apart fom that its well made and looks very cool. A good present for a halo fan"
18245,5589,5," cant wait to give this for a pressie at xmas to go with his other ones& great product"
18246,5589,4," cool looking model"
18247,5590,5," Great tray& everything fits perfectly and a great price. Delivered sooner than expected. Would thoroughly recommend to all Armada players!"
18248,5590,5," I've ordered a lot of these foam trays to protect various models and they have all been good quality and a snug fit"
18249,5591,4," My 7yr old son has owned this toy for over a year now"
18250,5592,5," Bought for my friend's son and he loves it. Great for younger super hero fans - nice and chunky with a simple but fun mechanism."
18251,5592,3," Grandchildren extremely pleased with this Captain America& Super Hero figure."
18252,5592,5," Strong and chunky& perfect for little hands. My son loves it"
18253,5592,5," purchased for grandson's birthday he loves it"
18254,5592,5," Does exactly what it says on the tin!"
18255,5592,5," Good quality toy easy to operate"
18256,5593,5," got this for my niece who loves HP& she absolutely loves this!"
18257,5593,4," Bought as a present. I was very happy with the quality of this map& and my niece was delighted with it"
18258,5594,5," I bought this for my brother who is a very serious collector so unfortunately I did not get to take it out of its box& therefore I cannot comment on how durable this will be for playing.  But it looks good in his collection and I really like the 'surf board'."
18259,5594,4," Bought this figure& along with the other Thundercats for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves them& and both Wilykat and Wilykit are the most durable by far.Great fun for a Thundercat fan!"
18260,5594,5," I got these for my little boy's birthday he was totally over the moon by far his best gifts. There will be hours of fun with these toys. One of my best buys this year."
18261,5595,4," This figure really does look like he's stepped right out of the movie& the sculpt and paint are that good! He comes with a German pistol& clear blue cube (which he grips in his left hand rather nicely) and an over-sized missile launching rocket...thing.The point that let's this figure down though& in my opinion& is the fact that the lower part of his rubber jacket comes down over his hips& preventing his legs from moving even though he has the joints to do so. I think a slit in the rubber down either side would have allowed for more pose-ability but as it is your stuck with him in a fairly neutral stance. Also& unlike his heroic nemesis& he doesn't have any ball-jointed ankles which again limits his actions.He seems fairly sturdy apart from the joints in his knees which have a flimsy feel to them. These parts might suffer from rougher play from children so be warned parents!In a nut-shell& it's a very cool figure and a must have for Marvel collectors& especially if you own the Super Combat Captain America. After all& every hero needs his villain! Children do need to be careful with them though."
18262,5595,4," Captain America main bad buy and Nazi Red Skull& the figure is not that impressive overall& design looks ok& but legs have not been designed that well and are `bandy' therefore does not stand well. Comes with a pistol like Captain America& but unlike him has no holster to store it. Also comes with rocket launcher& which is ok& but essentially just same design as ones in SWars and GI Joe Hasbro ranges. Lastly there is also a little blue flame it comes with& this is weird because this fits no where on figure at all and seems to serve absolutely no purpose though I have not seen new film yet. It does not even show it at all on picture on the rear of box& which usually shows you where things are supposed to go& strange. Overall it's ok& but also not particularly impressive in any way. Previous review says it fits in hand& I cant see how myself& but will try again later"
18263,5596,5," up the irons this is amazing figure to have as I'm a iron maiden fan love the music and love eddie too ive got the other eddie figures too so its complete for now"
18264,5597,4," We have a similar red ranger which comes with sounds this one didn't so I was slightly disappointed but my 3 year old loves it."
18265,5597,5," Happy with purchase& it arrived on time and was exactly as it was described. Would recommend."
18266,5597,4," My son was so excited.. He went to bed holding it as soon as it was opened.."
18267,5597,1," I ordered a red& green and blue. I received a green power ranger and 2 reds."
18268,5598,5," This 3& 3/4| figure has a great range of articulation. shoulders& elbows& wrists& thighs& knees& ankles& neck& torso.The two pistols are my favourite part& which both fit into the holsters on Rex's belt. His helmet fits snuggly& and he's easy to pose. The card and die that comes with it are basically a top trumps game."
18269,5598,5," This is a great figure& nice details. Awesome articulation.The guns that come with it are great& the fact that the pistols fit perfectly in the holsters is great.The helmet fits perfectly and the head looks good."
18270,5599,5," My son loved this substantial toy& it is really chunky and well made so it can withstand lots of rough and tumble play. When you press the button down (easy enough for small fingers!) the drill goes round. Lots of fun imaginative play to be had with this!"
18271,5599,3," Item scratched but will have to do as a stocking filler. Disappointing"
18272,5600,5," Very true to the Batman classic series of the 1960's and highly recommended for collectors looking for collectors pieces as well as being relevant for todays fan."
18273,5600,5," Filthy criminal. Great figure."
18274,5600,5," FAB"
18275,5601,5," arrived in excellent condition"
18276,5602,5," Okay& Hal Jordan figures come and go. There is a new one just around the corner as I type%!"
