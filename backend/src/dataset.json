It was employed on long-distance express trains on the LNER and its successors, British Railways Eastern and North-Eastern Regions, notably on the 10am London to Edinburgh Flying Scotsman service after which it was named.

Plastic model kit. Manufacturers Description: William Stanier (1876-1965) was headhunted from the GWR to become Chief Mechanical Engineer of London, Midland and Scottish (LMS) Railways in 1932. With the support of the Chairman, Sir Josiah Stamp, Stanier is credited with modernising the LMS fleet of generally small steam locomotives with a larger, modern and more powerful array of designs. Soon after his appointment, Stanier also focused on refurbishing and standardising the Coach stock of the LMS and developed the Period III LMS coaches which later became known as Stanier Coaches. These designs were extremely popular and successful and many were still in service in the mid 1960's. There are many examples of Period III coaches operating on Heritage Railways throughout the UK today. The Dapol OO Model of the Stanier Coach is derived from refurbished Airfix/Mainline tooling originally purchased by Dapol in the 1980's. There are some compromises on detail accuracy due to the condition and usability of the 40+ year old tooling. However, we feel the model captures the essence of the Period III coach design well and offers an extremely affordable way of building up a fleet of pre or post nationalised fleet of LMS coaches. Dapol have strived to ensure livery and colour details have been captured and are comparable to the originals, including the roof level gold lines. The Kit comes complete with decorated body, all that is required is painting of the roof and other components and assembly.

It was the smallest of the 'Big Four' railway regions with most of it's revenue coming from passenger traffic rather than freight in the more densely populated region of southern England. A number of famous 'named' trains were operated by SR including the Brighton Belle, Bournemouth Belle, Golden Arrow, the Night Ferry (London - Paris and Brussels), Atlantic Coast Express and the Devon Belle. Both Richard Maunsell and Oliver Bulleid served as Chief Mechanical Engineers to the SR between 1923 and 1948 and both designed new locomotives and rolling stock to replace those inherited in 1923. The electrification of the region began in 1929 under the management of Sir Herbert Walker. On completion it was the world's largest electrified railway system. Southern Railway gave the designation 2-BIL to the DC third rail electric multiple units built during the 1930s. The formation was a 2-car set: MBTL-DTCL, and were called 2-BIL (2-car Bi-Lavatory stock) because each set had two lavatories, one in each car. They were built to work long distance semi-fast services on the newly electrified lines from London to Eastbourne, Portsmouth and Reading. Between 1935 and 1938, a total of 152 sets of the Class 2-BIL were built in 4 batches and were numbered 2001-2152. Numbers 2001-2010 in 1935 for service on the London to Eastbourne sector. Numbers 2011-2048 in 1936 for the London Waterloo to Alton and Portsmouth slow service.

Completed in 2008, Tornado was the first such locomotive built in the United Kingdom since Evening Star, the last steam locomotive built by British Railways, in 1960. Designed to meet modern safety and certification standards, Tornado runs on the UK rail network and on mainline-connected heritage railways.The locomotive was built by the A1 Steam Locomotive Trust, a charitable trust founded in 1990 to build Tornado and possibly further locomotives. Tornado was conceived as an evolution of the LNER Peppercorn Class A1 class, incorporating improvements likely had steam continued, and changes for cost, safety, manufacturing and operational benefits, while replicating the original design's sound and appearance. Tornado, completely new-built, is considered the 50th Peppercorn A1, numbered next in the class after 60162, Saint Johnstoun, built in 1949.Tornado moved under her own power for the first time on 29 July 2008 at Darlington, and then spent two months at the preserved Great Central Railway double-track tourist railway in Loughborough, where she was tested up to 60 mph (97 km/h) and operated her first passenger train. Tornado then moved to the National Railway Museum (NRM) in York for three test runs on the main line up to 75 mph (121 km/h). After repainting into LNER Apple Green, Tornado was approved for main-line passenger operation. On 31 January 2009 she hauled her first passenger trip on the main line, The Peppercorn Pioneer, from York to Newcastle and back. By hauling various A1 Trust railtours, charters and other activities, Tornado will begin to recoup the estimated \u00a3800,000 debt from the project, which cost around \u00a33 million.The new Hornby model is represented in the familiar Apple Green of the early British Railways colour scheme.Young or old, keen modeller or just a beginner, the Hornby RailRoad range answers the needs of many and is a perfect complement to the variety of locomotives, rolling stock, track, buildings, and accessories that can be found in the current Hornby catalogue. Devoid of easily damaged detail parts the suitably livered RailRoad locomotives are fitted with efficient drive mechanisms and have pickups on all drive wheels ensuring smooth running. All the RailRoad models are fitted with the standard Hornby hook and bar type couplings and will therefore easily couple to those locomotives and rolling stock in both the standard Hornby and Thomas & Friends ranges. With this in mind it is easy to see that those models that make up the Hornby RailRoad range are a simple and cost effective way of adding to a train set providing a suitable and most appropriate stepping stone into the varied and fascinating World of model railways.The introductory range offers not only a selection of individual locomotives, rolling stock and accessories but an assortment of train and wagon packs ideally suited for either train set rolling stock enhancements or for those who wish to experiment and try their hands at developing their modelling techniques!This DCC Ready locomotive is compatible with analogue train layouts, but can easily be converted for use on a DCC (digital) layout.

During its inaugural journey it reached speeds of 112mph, setting a new world record. Built at the LNE R\u2019s Doncaster works, Silver Link was built in only eleven weeks and entered into full service on the 7th September 1935. Silver Link was one of only four of the A4s to carry the two tone silver grey paint scheme. The model here depicts the locomotive during its LNER period between the years of 1935 and 1937.

Originally numbered 4498, Sir Nigel Gresley was due to receive the name Bittern, before the realisation of its commemorative status. As with the earlier LNER A4 Pacifics, it was built with a single chimney and side valances covering the wheels which were later removed to improve maintenance access. Sir Nigel Gresley carries a commemorative plaque as the holder of the post-war steam speed record reaching 112mph in May 1959. As with the Mallard\u2019s record this was achieved descending southward from Stoke Summit, but unlike the Mallard\u2019s special attempt this was with a full train of passengers returning from an excursion. As with other A4s, Sir Nigel Gresley has worn many liveries throughout its career. When released to traffic in October 1937 it carried the standard LNER garter blue of the A4 Pacifics and has since carried various liveries. Sir Nigel Gresley, now bearing the British Railways number 60007 with a British Railways blue livery, was saved from scrapping in 1966 by a small group of men who set up the \u2018A4 Preservation Society\u2019, later known as \u2018The A4 Locomotive Society Ltd\u2019 and now \u2018The Sir Nigel Gresley Locomotive Preservation Trust Ltd\u2019. \u2018The A4 Locomotive Society\u2019 has since become the subsidiary company that operates the locomotive for the Trust. The Trust is committed to keeping the locomotive operating and running special excursions on both the main line and heritage railways such as the North Yorkshire Moors Railway where it is based.This is an accurate, detailed scale model in die cast presented in a perspex display case mounted on a plinth.

Luchador! Mexican Wrestling Dice is a two-player dice game (with optional rules for four-player tag-team play) based on the popular world of professional Mexican wrestling, or \"Lucha Libre\" (a.k.a. free fighting). Players start with 21 points of health (or 18 in a tag-team match) and roll custom dice to try to either reduce the opponent's strength points to zero to win by a knock-out (KO) or hold the opponent down on the mat for a \"count of three\" to win by a pin. The player sitting near the 'red' corner of the wrestling ring uses 4 'red' wrestling dice, the player near the 'blue' corner, the 4 blue wrestling dice. Each player also has a HIT die and a PIN die. Players begin by each rolling their own set of 'wrestling dice' at the same time, trying to ensure that they land in, or touching the wrestling ring. The results of HITs, BLOCKs, COUNTERs, and MISS rolled are played off against each other then the HIT dice can be rolled to see what damage they did. i.e Drop Kick, Forearm smash, Table slam etc. Damage is recorded on the Strength Score Card of the player being hit. If a player rolls two HITs in one round, instead of rolling the HIT dice twice, they can take a chance on the Luchador! die once which may result in their wrestler's trademark moves and inflict much more damage on their opponent. Any PINs rolled in a round may be re-rolled, once only. However once an opponent is reduced on their strength to where they are pinable, the PIN die is held until after the HITs have been inflicted then the PIN die is rolled. If PIN comes up, the 'three count' begins. The player being pinned has three attempts to save, using their wrestling dice or lose the match. In a tag-team match players have the choice of trying to tag-out to regain slight strength, but it can also cost them..., if they fail to tag and get dragged back into the ring by their eager opponent.

But despite its size, this game certainly is substantial! There are 9 special alphabet dice, featuring letters on their faces and score values depending on how usuable they are. The aim of the games is to build the highest-scoring word you can. The key to this game is that the contents of the entire set are listed on what is called The Dice Table, each die being identifiable by a unique colour (and a special character for the colour blind). The Dice Table enables you to assess the chance of achieving particular letters when rerolling, making for a compelling game of luck, skill and judgement. And the Dicewords set offers over 10 million combinations, so it's a different game every time. ) An ideal game for travel and summer holidays, easy to pop into a pocket or handbag and an excellent game for Christmas and those long winter nights. An ideal aid for foreign students learning English too! ) ) ) \"Dicewords is an excellent, very well-realised game, not to mention a very portable one - the dice, rules and scoring sheets are all contained in a snug little plastic tube. Also, the packaging is designed in such a way that there are no superfluous bits of plastic wrapping or cardboard that will end up on a landfill somewhere.

Set Up Each player takes either the red or black set of sixteen dice and prepares to set up at opposite ends of the board. Players then simultaneously roll each of their sixteen dice, one at a time. Once rolled, each die is placed immediately on the board. This commences of the left square on a player\u2019s back row and continues across to the right. On completion of the back row, the dice are placed from the left again on the next row up. After each roll, each die must be placed onto the next available square. Players cannot select on which square they would like to place each die. Once both players have completed the set up, play commences. Rules The player with the most sixes starts (if the players have the same amount, then the player with the most fives starts and so on). Players take one turn each alternately. A player can move any one die the number of squares that corresponds to the number showing on that die. For example, if that number is a 3, the player can move that die forwards, backwards, sideways or diagonally up or down in a straight line over three squares. Within the movement the die cannot pass over any other die (either an opponent\u2019s die or their own). If any move results in a die landing on a square occupied by an opponent\u2019s die then the opponent\u2019s die is \u2018taken\u2019 and removed from the board. Instead of moving a die on any turn a player can opt to rotate one of their dice 90 degrees. For example a die with a 3 showing can be turned over to a 1,2,5 or 6 whilst remaining on its current square. This movement constitutes a player\u2019s turn. Winning the Game The first player to get one of their dice onto any square along their opponent\u2019s back row, which their opponent cannot then take on their very next turn, wins the game.

The car was different from its disappointing predecessor, the Jordan EJ10. The EJ11 now had seven gears instead of the previous car's six, and also featured a much higher nose (resulting in a shark-based livery). But, most notably, the team now had works Honda engines, replacing the Mugen Honda engines used for the previous three years. This put the team into direct competition with fellow-Honda users British American Racing. Much was expected of the EJ11. After the disappointing 2000 season, where the team finished only sixth in the Constructors' Championship, the EJ11 was expected to return the team to the very front of the grid. The car was very fast in pre-season testing, regularly topping the time sheets at many tracks. The team's lead driver, Heinz-Harald Frentzen, claimed it was the best car he had ever driven, and that he could become champion driving it.

It was a 'rolling laboratory' from which Ford would learn about new technology to apply to their production automobiles. The car was built entirely by hand in Turin, Italy and, like many concept cars, was never put into production. In the mid 1960's, George Barris of Barris Kustom City acquired the car directly from Ford.The story goes that he was approached by producers from Fox who were going to be doing a BATMAN TV Series and needed an exotic car. George sketched out a version of the Futura with suitable \"Bat\" alterations and presented it to the producers. George felt it was the perfect answer, considering the bat-like qualities his Futura already had and the fact that the car had to be ready for action in a mere three weeks. Sometime later in October of 1965, the BATMOBILE was born. This die-cast model will impress even the biggest BATMAN fan with its accuracy and excellent detail", "subcatid":81, "catid":8},

Building the stunning replica of Hogwarts Castle was challenging and exciting and resulted in several hours of silence and unprecedented concentration. The stunning, unexpected details were impressive: trap doors, secret stairways, moving portraits, treasure chests, a working magnifying glass, an impressive holographic sticker, a glow-in-the-dark Voldemort and a Hagrid who, in comparison to the other figures, was a perfectly proportioned giant. The basic instructions were easy to follow and the castle can be built in many different ways, allowing children to use their imaginations and recreate scenes from the books. This is a sure-fire winner for any Harry Potter fan, and indeed for any LEGO fan. The Gryffindor Dormitory set and the Chamber of the Winged Keys are less difficult to build and would make great presents, particularly for younger Harry Potter fans, but when combined with the Hogwarts Castle set they add new dimensions to the scene. For once it seems that movie merchandise has really hit the spot. Age 7 (and a half!) and over. Susan Harrison See all Product Description", "subcatid":65, "catid":6},

Despite the proved success of the A3s, Gresley and his engineers needed to take the next step to become quicker and more efficient. Whilst looking at ways to progress he travelled to Germany and America looking at their evolvement but because of size restrictions on the British railway network he discovered that their larger locomotives were not an option. It was then that chief designer Sir Nigel Gresley looked into aerodynamics, thus creating the \u2018Silver Jubilee\u2019 streamlined trains which were inspired by a Bugatti rail-car that he observed on a trip to France. After wind tunnel tests it was also discovered that not only could they achieve greater speeds whilst using less energy, the design also meant that an updraft off the locomotive pushed the steam upwards giving the driver improved driving vision. Over a three year period between 1935 and 1938 there were a total of thirty five A4s built at the LNER's Doncaster works. The first four A4s all had the word 'Silver' in the title, this was in relation to the King George V Silver Jubilee, five were named after Commonwealth countries but with Gresley being a keen bird watcher, the majority were named after fast flying birds. Arguably the most famous of all the class is the Mallard, carrying the distinctive streamline casing in Garter Blue, the appearance of this A4 depicts the 1930s real captivation with speed and luxury. The Mallard was the locomotive chosen to attempt breaking the world speed record, on the 3rd July 1938 heading south at Stoke Bank near Grantham, the Mallard broke the record measuring 125.88mph. To this day it still holds the record for being the fastest steam locomotive in the world. The Mallard is now part of the National Railway Collection on static display at Shildon.

Its founder, Thomas Wynn was originally employed on the railways, but soon saw a need for an improved \"onward distribution\" system after goods were unloaded from the trains. Using a fleet of horses and carts, he transported goods that were delivered directly to Newport by rail and soon formed an association with a local flourmill, delivering flour to bakeries and shops in the local valleys. An association that carried on until well into the 1950s, when the mill had to close. After the death of Thomas Wynn in 1878, his 15 year-old son, Robert Wynn (who later gave his name to the company) took over the business with the help of his eldest sister, Emma. The business continued to grow and Robert saw the possibilities for heavy haulage as the steel works in Newport were developed. In 1890 he built a boiler wagon capable of carrying 40 tons of heavy machinery with the propulsion still provided by up to 48 horses. The K8 (3 Way) Van commenced production in 1947 and the van cost \u00a3535. It earned the name 3-Way due to the door configuration. To assist loading and unloading, it featured double doors on the near and offside, as well as opening near doors. With a payload of 25 cwt and a short wheelbase, it proved a very nippy vehicle for delivery purposes. The van was discontinued in 1954, by which time over 26,500 had been manufactured. This little K8 is shown in the WYNNS livery and carries the registration EDW 640.", "subcatid":81, "catid":8},

Our newly tooled Humber Pullman is a superb miniature. Starting with the exterior, the back and burgundy two-tone paintwork is offset by a wealth of silver chrome effect masking from the radiator, headlights, door handles and rear light clusters to the authentic replica of the Pullman badge. The Humber badge is masked in red out of silver and the Rothschild crest adorns the front doors. We love the whitewall tyres, which complement the contrasting burgundy wheel inserts. Inside, the detail is even more amazing. In the front, the dashboard top and the steering wheel are reproduced in 'sunshine' beige with a detailed dashboard and door cappings in brown.

Tiger I is the common name of a German heavy tank developed in 1942 and used in World War II. The final official German designation was Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger Ausf.E, often shortened to Tiger. It was an answer to the unexpectedly impressive Soviet armour encountered in the initial months of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, particularly the T-34 and the KV-1. The Tiger I gave the Wehrmacht its first tank mounting the 88 mm gun in its first armoured fighting vehicle-dedicated version: the KwK 36. During the course of the war, the Tiger I saw combat on all German battlefronts. It was usually deployed in independent tank battalions, which proved to be formidable.

It was known for its unconventional turretless design, with a fixed gun traversed by engaging the tracks and elevated by adjusting the hull suspension. Turretless armoured fighting vehicles are usually classified as assault guns or tank destroyers, but the Strv 103 is considered a tank because of its gun laying ability and its designated combat role matches those of other tanks. It is the only main battle tank and the only tank of any kind since the World War II era to dispense with a turret. The Strv 103 was designed and manufactured in Sweden. It was developed in the 1950s and was the first main battle tank to use a turbine engine. The result was a very low-profile design with an emphasis on defence and heightened crew protection level. Strv 103s formed a major portion of the Swedish armoured forces from the 1960s to part of the 1990s, but have since been removed from service in favour of the Stridsvagn 122.

The AS-90 was first deployed by the British Army in 1993.[1] 179 AS-90s were acquired to re-equip six of the eight self-propelled field artillery regiments (each 24 guns) in the 1 (BR) Corps, replacing the 105 mm FV433 Abbot SPG and older M109 155 mm Self Propelled Gun. It remains in UK service and will equip three field regiments supporting armoured infantry brigades for the foreseeable future. AS-90 was designed and built by the Armaments division of Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering (VSEL), whose parent company became BAE Systems in 1999. VSEL provided 179 vehicles between 1992 and 1995 at a cost of \u00a3300 million ($480 million USD). The AS-90 underwent a capability enhancement program in 2008 and 2009, primarily relating to upgrades of the AS-90's electronic system. In 1999, Marconi Electronic Systems was contracted to upgrade British Army AS-90s to include a 52 calibre gun in order to increase the range of the artillery. Critical to the program was a bi-modular charge system from Somchem of South Africa (selected after extensive trials of ammunition from many suppliers), which offered greatly reduced barrel wear. However, this ammunition failed to meet the requirement for insensitive munitions and the project was terminated. PLASTIC MODEL KIT REQUIRES ASSEMBLY AND PAINTING. GLUE AND PAINT NOT INCLUDED.

The new tank, long-desired by the German soldiers who had hard-fought battles against the allies, became known as the Tiger I Ausf. E. Development of the Tiger I began at the end of May 1941. The German Army Weapons Branch ordered the Henschel firm to vie with Porsche in producing a prototype. The first prototypes underwent trials on April 1942. The result of these and subsequent trial showed the superiority of the Henschel vehicle to the Porsche's, and thus production orders were placed for it. The Henschel's prototype had thick armor of 100mm at the front and 80mm on both sides, and the main gun was the then most potent, the 8.8cm KwK 36 L/56. The powerplant was Maybach's HL 210 P45, yielding 650 horsepower. Mass production started already in August 1942 with little alteration from the prototype. Starting from November 1942, air pre-cleaners were added on the rear hull plate. The mantlet was partly strengthened and S\" mine dischargers were fitted on five mounting points around the hull roof beginning from December. Moreover, a loader's periscope was fitted from January 1943. The Tiger I produced from November 1942 to July 1943 featured these modifications, are referred to as the early production.

It was known for its unconventional turretless design, with a fixed gun traversed by engaging the tracks and elevated by adjusting the hull suspension. Turretless armoured fighting vehicles are usually classified as assault guns or tank destroyers, but the Strv 103 is considered a tank because of its gun laying ability and its designated combat role matches those of other tanks. It is the only main battle tank and the only tank of any kind since the World War II era to dispense with a turret. The Strv 103 was designed and manufactured in Sweden. It was developed in the 1950s and was the first main battle tank to use a turbine engine. The result was a very low-profile design with an emphasis on defence and heightened crew protection level. Strv 103s formed a major portion of the Swedish armoured forces from the 1960s to part of the 1990s, but have since been removed from service in favour of the Stridsvagn 122.

The Panther and the Soviet T-34 are considered by many to be the best tanks of World War II.When in June of 1941, Germany invaded Russia, many KV series and T-34/76 tanks were encountered, which were far superior in firepower and armour protection to any Panzer at the time. It was then decided, because of the constant reports from the Eastern Front to design a new more powerful medium tank, which could be quickly put into production. Two versions were put forward, one closely based on the T34 design, the other (which went into production) a more sophisticated design.The Panther was the first German-made tank with sloping armour. Although its design was in some ways similar to the T-34/76, the Panther was larger, heavier, and different in many technical aspects. The Panther had large overlapping road wheels and a state-of-the-art suspension system that enabled it to traverse rough terrain at high speed.The Panther was armed with a 75mm KwK 42 L/70 gun, which was capable of penetrating almost 150mm thick armour at a range of 1000 meter; the Panther\u0092s 75mm gun had penetration slightly better than the 88mm gun of the Tiger.Box contains 2 tanks.

The terrible muddy and icy conditions experienced on the Eastern Front convinced Germany of the need for a highly mobile, tracked vehicle. Steyr proposed the RSO and it immediately became a popular vehicle thanks to its mobility and reliability. In all, about 23,000 RSO vehicles were produced by a range of manufacturers. The original version had a pressed-steel cab and a typical truck-style cargo bed at the rear. It was powered by a Steyr 85hp V8 engine that offered a top speed of 30km/h. Dragon\u2019s new 1/35 scale model depicts the standard RSO/01, this type with rounded steel cab being the best known of all the versions used by Germany. Indeed, the complex shape of the cab was created by a Japanese model-maker, and it is easily the most accurate cab available on the market today. The cab is a sophisticated piece of molding in terms of detail and measurements, with all the curves accurately reproduced in miniature.

The six torpedo tubes in the bow could fire a total of 24 torpedoes. The newly developedS5W nuclear reactor enabled her to remain submerged for a long period and her range was only limited by food stores. The shipyard test run confirmed sensational performance with a top speed of over 30 knots when dived. When the USS Skipjack was transferred to the fleet on 15th April 1959, the US Navy received its first true submersible that could operate submerged for months at atime to secure the safety of fast-moving fleet units. Until their decommissioning the six vessels of the Skipjack Class formed the senior unit of the US submarine fleet.

It was produced in greater numbers than any other American combat aircraft of World War II, and still holds the record as the most-produced American military or naval aircraft.Often compared with the better-known B-17 Flying Fortress, the B-24 was a more modern design with a higher top speed, greater range, and a heavier bomb load; however, it was also more difficult to fly, with heavy control forces and poor formation-flying characteristics. The Consolidated Liberator VI was the RAF designation for the B-24H and early B-24Js, the first production versions of the aircraft to be built with a nose turret This was the most numerous RAF version of the Liberator, with over 1,100 being delivered from late in 1943. Coastal Commond used a slightly modified version very successfully against the U-Boat threat in the North Atlantic, taking the offensive much further into areas of the ocean not reached by previous aircraft types.

With over 90 phrases, sounds and silly jokes, motion sensors in his wheels, LED lights on his head and motorised movement, Smokey provides hours of open-ended play. When Smokey is on all six wheels, he is in Truck Mode. Push Smokey forward or pull him backward to activate lights and sounds. Push the lighting buttons on top to activate even more, giving plenty of variety to your child's playtime. Smokey can be pulled halfway or completely upright using the lever on his right. Whether halfway or fully, he is then in Character Mode. Raise and lower Smokey repeatedly to make him sing and dance. Smokey knows four different songs, but to keep up the variety, he won't sing every time. Keep trying if you really want to hear him sing. When Smokey is pulled upright, he can also shoot his 'water' cannon balls. Load the three supplied balls into the chute, turn the cannon left, right, back or forward to aim and then pull the lever on the left to shoot. (Warning: Do not aim at eyes or face. Only use the projectiles supplied with this toy. Do not fire at point-blank range.) Smokey will also fall asleep if he is left alone for a while.

The player to the dealer's left starts by reading out a selected statistic (e.g. Weight or Speed). The other players then read out the same statistic from their own top cards. The player with the best or highest value wins and places all the top cards including their own to the bottom of their own pile.

See how your favourite pooch scores on categories including Weight, Height, Guard Dog Skill, Rarity and Loveability. So cute you'll want to take it to bed and cuddle it!Top Trumps has been played since the 1970s when the first packs took the playgrounds of the UK by storm. And its success is partly due to how easy and compelling it is to play: shuffle and deal all the cards face down. Each player takes their cards and holds them so that they can see the top card only. The player to the dealer's left starts by reading out a selected statistic (e.g. Weight or Speed). The other players then read out the same statistic from their own top cards. The player with the best or highest value wins and places all the top cards including their own to the bottom of their own pile. It is then that player's turn to choose a statistic from the next card. If two or more cards share the top value or data is unavailable for that statistic, then all the top cards are placed in the middle and the same player chooses from the next card. The winner of that hand takes all the cards from the middle as well. The person with all the cards at the end is the winner, easy.", "subcatid":105, "catid":15},

He has become the Living Guildpact, the embodiment of the guilds' agreement to share power, and he works tirelessly to preserve that peace. The deadly gorgon Vraska, a Planeswalker who was born on Ravnica, is an assassin for hire who follows her own arcane moral code.

Though she works mostly with the Golgari guild, she is bound by no permanent allegiance. In the wrong hands, Vraska's skills could destabilize an entire world.

Hosting a party? Stuck in an airport? Then it's time for Uno, the classic card game, which is quick to learn, easy to play and fun for all the family. The aim of the game is to be the first player to score 500 points, by getting rid of all the cards in your hand before your opponents. You score points for all the cards left in your opponents' hands. The rules of Uno are simple. Every player picks a card and the person who draws the highest number deals (Action Cards count as zero at this stage). Once the pack has been shuffled, each player is dealt 7 cards. The remainder of the deck is placed face down to form a DRAW pile. And the top card of the DRAW pile is turned over to start a DISCARD pile. The person to the left of the dealer starts play and has to match the card on the DISCARD pile, either by number or colour. So, if the card is a red 7, the player must put down a red card or any 7 card regardless of its colour. Alternatively, the player can put down a Wild Card. If the player doesn't have a card to match the one on the DISCARD pile, they must take a card from the DRAW pile. If this can be played, the player is free to put it down in the same turn. Otherwise, play moves on to the next person. Players may choose not to play a playable card from their hand. If so, they must draw a card from the DRAW pile. If playable, that card can be put down in the same turn, but the player may not use a card from the hand after the draw. Players race to get rid of their cards and the real fun starts when special Action Cards are used to foil opponents and gain an advantage. With the tension mounting, Uno becomes the fun family card game that's easy to pick up but impossible to put down. Box Contains 108 x Uno cards1 x Instruction guide", "subcatid":105, "catid":15},

Having successfully protected his land, the Red Dragonw would rest at dawn. One night, the Titams offered a to give a man extraordinary powers if he would help to kill the Red Dragon. Blinded by greed, the man entered the Dragon's cave at dawn and killed him while he lay sleeping. The body of the Dragon shattered into thousands of pieces which became scattered across all Aernia. The Titans had tricked the weak man and now they were free to roam the land and cast their evil wherever they wished.

Supplied in packs of four pairs, each joiner has a short length of wire securely pre-soldered to it. The modeller just has to substitute the standard metal joiners for a pair of these where the power feed is required, and pass the wires down through pre-drilled holes in the baseboard. With approximately 8 inches (204mm) of wire on each one there should be plenty of length available to go through most baseboards. In turn these wires can be connected to longer runs of wiring under the baseboard and be taken back to the outlet terminals of the transformer.

A nice little touch is the pair of Union Flags on the side of the engine cowling above the front wheels, as well as the Field Marshall logo which also features on the side in silver. The Lincolnshire based company of Marshall, Sons & Co started manufacturing tractors in 1930, the year which saw the launch of the single cylinder Marshall 15/30. Various upgrades were introduced during the 1930s, although production was reduced during the war years when the factory was engaged in war work. The Field Marshall - a much improved tractor - was introduced immediately after WWII with the Series 1 (1945-1947). Series 2 followed between 1947 and 1949, Series 3 (1949-1953) and finally Series 3A (1953-1957). Up to the time of Series 3, which had an optional electric starter, the starting mechanism was by present standards, quite antiquated. The method comprised a smouldering piece of paper containing saltpetre, which was inserted into the cylinder head by means of a special screw-in holder in the cylinder head. The driver then had to crank up the engine with a starting handle.

The TKS was an improved model with a new hull and a more powerful engine. The\u00a0armour\u00a0of the TK was up to 8\u00a0mm thick (10\u00a0mm on the TKS). In 1939, re-arming of the tankettes with\u00a038FK\u00a020\u00a0mm machine guns began, but only about 24 were completed before the outbreak of World War II. The 575 TK/TKS tankettes formed the bulk of the Polish armoured forces before the outbreak of war. They suffered heavy losses during the Invasion of Poland, often being the only armoured fighting vehicles available. Due to their light armament of a single machine gun, they stood no chance in combat against German tanks, except the Panzer I, but their small size suited them for reconnaissance and infantry support. Only the handful of tankettes armed with 20 mm guns had a fighting chance against the enemy tanks; in one instance on 18 September 1939 a 20 mm gunned TKS with Nkm wz.38 FK commanded by Podchorazy or Officer Candidate in the rank of SFC Roman Orlik destroyed three German Panzerkampfwagen 35(t) tanks. After conquest of Poland, the tankettes were taken over and used by the Germans. In this role they saw various uses, mostly for training, security duties or artillery tractors.

The Lincolnshire based company of Marshall, Sons & Co started manufacturing tractors in 1930, the year which saw the launch of the single cylinder Marshall 15/30. Various upgrades were introduced during the 1930s, although production was reduced during the war years when the factory was engaged in war work. The Field Marshall - a much improved tractor - was introduced immediately after WWII with the Series 1 (1945-1947). Series 2 followed between 1947 and 1949, Series 3 (1949-1953) and finally Series 3A (1953-1957). Up to the time of Series 3, which had an optional electric starter, the starting mechanism was by present standards, quite antiquated. The method comprised a smouldering piece of paper containing saltpetre, which was inserted into the cylinder head by means of a special screw-in holder in the cylinder head. The driver then had to crank up the engine with a starting handle.
