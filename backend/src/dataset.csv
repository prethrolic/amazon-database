2667,Winning Moves - Top Trumps World Football Stars,897,2.95,5,1,5,"Manufacturer's Description To celebrate the worldâs greatest game weâve got 2006 World Football Stars! The pack features thirty of the greatest players from all over the world are included in this definitive guide to the beautiful game. Top Trumps has been played since the 1970s when the first packs took the playgrounds of the UK by storm. And its success is partly due to how easy and compelling it is to play: shuffle and deal all the cards face down. Each player takes their cards and holds them so that they can see the top card only. The player to the dealer's left starts by reading out a selected statistic (e.g. Weight or Speed). The other players then read out the same statistic from their own top cards. The player with the best or highest value wins and places all the top cards including their own to the bottom of their own pile. It is then that player's turn to choose a statistic from the next card. If two or more cards share the top value or data is unavailable for that statistic, then all the top cards are placed in the middle and the same player chooses from the next card. The winner of that hand takes all the cards from the middle as well. The person with all the cards at the end is the winner, easy.",105,15

The gators didnt seem to pay him much attention. Once in awhile, one would crawl up on his boat, and John would come out and talk to it in hushed tones until it wandered off.Folks found John strange, but it was clear he wasn't trouble. Just a kindly old coot who kept to himself. All sorts of stories were made up about the strange, swamp-dweller, but none came close to the truth. John Rhodes was, in fact, the worlds most talented alchemist, and wielder of the Philosophers Stone.John had always had an affinity for altering the very threads of existence. He could feel them as they stretched around him, connecting everything to everything else. So, when those lines drew him to a mysterious, glowing stone, he knew it was right and proper to take it with him. The stone allows him to twist the lines, rather than just perceive them, and he can now easily transmute objects into other materials.John, The Scholar, mostly keeps to himself, though hes always willing to share a bit of wisdom and a bite to eat with anyone who passes by. However, now and again, he feels the ley-lines pull and twang sharply, which shouldnt happen. Hell travel from one place to another, easing the tension on the lines by stopping the odd, extra-planar entity from entering this dimension, or keeping the crazed scientist from pulling the moon into the earth, or halting the nightmarish legions of a comatose little girl. Sometimes, hell work with other gentle souls to accomplish his goal - he doesnt mind a little company now and then. Mainly he just wants to keep things copacetic.",105,15

And its success is partly due to how easy and compelling it is to play: shuffle and deal all the cards face down. Each player takes their cards and holds them so that they can see the top card only. The player to the dealer's left starts by reading out a selected statistic (e.g. Weight or Speed). The other players then read out the same statistic from their own top cards. The player with the best or highest value wins and places all the top cards including their own to the bottom of their own pile. It is then that player's turn to choose a statistic from the next card. If two or more cards share the top value or data is unavailable for that statistic, then all the top cards are placed in the middle and the same player chooses from the next card.

Then it's time for Uno, the classic card game, which is quick to learn, easy to play and fun for all the family. The aim of the game is to be the first player to score 500 points, by getting rid of all the cards in your hand before your opponents. You score points for all the cards left in your opponents' hands. The rules of Uno are simple. Every player picks a card and the person who draws the highest number deals (Action Cards count as zero at this stage). Once the pack has been shuffled, each player is dealt 7 cards. The remainder of the deck is placed face down to form a DRAW pile. And the top card of the DRAW pile is turned over to start a DISCARD pile. The person to the left of the dealer starts play and has to match the card on the DISCARD pile, either by number or colour. So, if the card is a red 7, the player must put down a red card or any 7 card regardless of its colour. Alternatively, the player can put down a Wild Card. If the player doesn't have a card to match the one on the DISCARD pile, they must take a card from the DRAW pile. If this can be played, the player is free to put it down in the same turn. Otherwise, play moves on to the next person. Players may choose not to play a playable card from their hand. If so, they must draw a card from the DRAW pile. If playable, that card can be put down in the same turn, but the player may not use a card from the hand after the draw. Players race to get rid of their cards and the real fun starts when special Action Cards are used to foil opponents and gain an advantage. With the tension mounting, Uno becomes the fun family card game that's easy to pick up but impossible to put down. Box Contains 108 x Uno cards1 x Instruction guide",105,15

155,"Backspindle Games ""Luchador! Mexican Wrestling"" Dice Game",64,23.65,7,1,5,"Product Description The fast-rolling, hard-hitting, body-slamming, neck-crunching, chair-smashing, table-slapping dice game for 2 or 4 players... Luchador! Mexican Wrestling Dice is a two-player dice game (with optional rules for four-player tag-team play) based on the popular world of professional Mexican wrestling, or ""Lucha Libre"" (a.k.a. free fighting). Players start with 21 points of health (or 18 in a tag-team match) and roll custom dice to try to either reduce the opponent's strength points to zero to win by a knock-out (KO) or hold the opponent down on the mat for a ""count of three"" to win by a pin. The player sitting near the 'red' corner of the wrestling ring uses 4 'red' wrestling dice, the player near the 'blue' corner, the 4 blue wrestling dice. Each player also has a HIT die and a PIN die. Players begin by each rolling their own set of 'wrestling dice' at the same time, trying to ensure that they land in, or touching the wrestling ring. The results of HITs, BLOCKs, COUNTERs, and MISS rolled are played off against each other then the HIT dice can be rolled to see what damage they did. i.e Drop Kick, Forearm smash, Table slam etc. Damage is recorded on the Strength Score Card of the player being hit. If a player rolls two HITs in one round, instead of rolling the HIT dice twice, they can take a chance on the Luchador! die once which may result in their wrestler's trademark moves and inflict much more damage on their opponent. Any PINs rolled in a round may be re-rolled, once only. However once an opponent is reduced on their strength to where they are pinable, the PIN die is held until after the HITs have been inflicted then the PIN die is rolled. If PIN comes up, the 'three count' begins. The player being pinned has three attempts to save, using their wrestling dice or lose the match. In a tag-team match players have the choice of trying to tag-out to regain slight strength, but it can also cost them..., if they fail to tag and get dragged back into the ring by their eager opponent. Box Contains 16 Wrestling Dice in 4 Colours (4 Dice in Red, Blue, Purple and Pink) 4 Green Hit Dice 4 Yellow Pin Dice 2 Black Luchador Dice The Luchador Arena 9 Luchador Cut-outs 8 Plastic Stands 9 Luchador Superstar Cards 9 Advanced Luchador Cards 8 Strength Score Cards 8 Strength Score Markers 1 Three-Dimensional Luchador Ring The World Championship Title Belt The Tag-Team Championship Title Belt 8 Combat Order Disks",108,15

160,DICEWORDS GAME,66,11.69,6,13,5,"Family fun with strategy and learning Dicewords comes in a smart tube and is probably the most compact word game ever. But despite its size, this game certainly is substantial! There are 9 special alphabet dice, featuring letters on their faces and score values depending on how usuable they are. The aim of the games is to build the highest-scoring word you can. The key to this game is that the contents of the entire set are listed on what is called The Dice Table, each die being identifiable by a unique colour (and a special character for the colour blind). The Dice Table enables you to assess the chance of achieving particular letters when rerolling, making for a compelling game of luck, skill and judgement. And the Dicewords set offers over 10 million combinations, so it's a different game every time. ) An ideal game for travel and summer holidays, easy to pop into a pocket or handbag and an excellent game for Christmas and those long winter nights. An ideal aid for foreign students learning English too! ) ) ) ""Dicewords is an excellent, very well-realised game, not to mention a very portable one - the dice, rules and scoring sheets are all contained in a snug little plastic tube. Also, the packaging is designed in such a way that there are no superfluous bits of plastic wrapping or cardboard that will end up on a landfill somewhere. A small point, perhaps, but an example of the kind of thought and consideration that's gone into every aspect of the game. Dicewords is a class act through and through, and I'd recommend it to anyone."" Review by Ben Rainbird, the actor",108,15

204,University Games 32 Dice Strategy Game,84,6.19,9,9,4.6,"Product Description Object of the Game To move one of your dice onto your opponent’s back line without that die being immediately taken by your opponent on their very next turn. Set Up Each player takes either the red or black set of sixteen dice and prepares to set up at opposite ends of the board. Players then simultaneously roll each of their sixteen dice, one at a time. Once rolled, each die is placed immediately on the board. This commences of the left square on a player’s back row and continues across to the right. On completion of the back row, the dice are placed from the left again on the next row up. After each roll, each die must be placed onto the next available square. Players cannot select on which square they would like to place each die. Once both players have completed the set up, play commences. Rules The player with the most sixes starts (if the players have the same amount, then the player with the most fives starts and so on). Players take one turn each alternately. A player can move any one die the number of squares that corresponds to the number showing on that die. For example, if that number is a 3, the player can move that die forwards, backwards, sideways or diagonally up or down in a straight line over three squares. Within the movement the die cannot pass over any other die (either an opponent’s die or their own). If any move results in a die landing on a square occupied by an opponent’s die then the opponent’s die is ‘taken’ and removed from the board. Instead of moving a die on any turn a player can opt to rotate one of their dice 90 degrees. For example a die with a 3 showing can be turned over to a 1,2,5 or 6 whilst remaining on its current square. This movement constitutes a player’s turn. Winning the Game The first player to get one of their dice onto any square along their opponent’s back row, which their opponent cannot then take on their very next turn, wins the game.

1162,LEGO Harry Potter 4709: Hogwarts Castle,103,374.96,8,8,4.9,"Product Description LEGO Harry Potter 4709: Hogwarts Castle - Brand New, Please note Box has shelf wear, this does not effect the sealed item Gifttogadget - LEGO 4709. - HARRY POTTER & THE SORCERER'S STONE Amazon.co.uk Review The inspired combination of Harry Potter and LEGO certainly made an impression on our two young testers; shortly after the challenge of building the LEGO Hogwarts Castle was set, they had planned out the pieces, having identified the characters and the settings from the book. Building the stunning replica of Hogwarts Castle was challenging and exciting and resulted in several hours of silence and unprecedented concentration. The stunning, unexpected details were impressive: trap doors, secret stairways, moving portraits, treasure chests, a working magnifying glass, an impressive holographic sticker, a glow-in-the-dark Voldemort and a Hagrid who, in comparison to the other figures, was a perfectly proportioned giant. The basic instructions were easy to follow and the castle can be built in many different ways, allowing children to use their imaginations and recreate scenes from the books. This is a sure-fire winner for any Harry Potter fan, and indeed for any LEGO fan. The Gryffindor Dormitory set and the Chamber of the Winged Keys are less difficult to build and would make great presents, particularly for younger Harry Potter fans, but when combined with the Hogwarts Castle set they add new dimensions to the scene. For once it seems that movie merchandise has really hit the spot. Age 7 (and a half!) and over. Susan Harrison See all Product Description",65,6

It was known for its unconventional turretless design, with a fixed gun traversed by engaging the tracks and elevated by adjusting the hull suspension. Turretless armoured fighting vehicles are usually classified as assault guns or tank destroyers, but the Strv 103 is considered a tank because of its gun laying ability and its designated combat role matches those of other tanks. It is the only main battle tank and the only tank of any kind since the World War II era to dispense with a turret. The Strv 103 was designed and manufactured in Sweden. It was developed in the 1950s and was the first main battle tank to use a turbine engine. The result was a very low-profile design with an emphasis on defence and heightened crew protection level. Strv 103s formed a major portion of the Swedish armoured forces from the 1960s to part of the 1990s, but have since been removed from service in favour of the Stridsvagn 122.

The AS-90 was first deployed by the British Army in 1993.[1] 179 AS-90s were acquired to re-equip six of the eight self-propelled field artillery regiments (each 24 guns) in the 1 (BR) Corps, replacing the 105 mm FV433 Abbot SPG and older M109 155 mm Self Propelled Gun. It remains in UK service and will equip three field regiments supporting armoured infantry brigades for the foreseeable future. AS-90 was designed and built by the Armaments division of Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering (VSEL), whose parent company became BAE Systems in 1999. VSEL provided 179 vehicles between 1992 and 1995 at a cost of £300 million ($480 million USD). The AS-90 underwent a capability enhancement program in 2008 and 2009, primarily relating to upgrades of the AS-90's electronic system. In 1999, Marconi Electronic Systems was contracted to upgrade British Army AS-90s to include a 52 calibre gun in order to increase the range of the artillery. Critical to the program was a bi-modular charge system from Somchem of South Africa (selected after extensive trials of ammunition from many suppliers), which offered greatly reduced barrel wear.

The new tank, long-desired by the German soldiers who had hard-fought battles against the allies, became known as the Tiger I Ausf. E. Development of the Tiger I began at the end of May 1941. The German Army Weapons Branch ordered the Henschel firm to vie with Porsche in producing a prototype. The first prototypes underwent trials on April 1942. The result of these and subsequent trial showed the superiority of the Henschel vehicle to the Porsche's, and thus production orders were placed for it. The Henschel's prototype had thick armor of 100mm at the front and 80mm on both sides, and the main gun was the then most potent, the 8.8cm KwK 36 L/56. The powerplant was Maybach's HL 210 P45, yielding 650 horsepower. Mass production started already in August 1942 with little alteration from the prototype. Starting from November 1942, air pre-cleaners were added on the rear hull plate. The mantlet was partly strengthened and S"" mine dischargers were fitted on five mounting points around the hull roof beginning from December. Moreover, a loader's periscope was fitted from January 1943. The Tiger I produced from November 1942 to July 1943 featured these modifications, are referred to as the early production.

1792,Armourfast 1/72 German Panzer III Ausf J Model Kit - Contains 2 Tanks,661,9.49,4,4,4,"As early as 1934/35, General Heinz Guderian envisioned two basic types to act as the main equipment for the future German Panzer Divisions. The first vehicle was to be armed with anti-tank gun and two machine guns and second one was to be a support vehicle armed with a larger calibre gun. The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion. The second one became known as Panzerkampfwagen IV. With the appearance of the T-34, rearming the Panzer III with a more powerful L/60 50mm gun was prioritized. The Ausf J version had this longer gun, thicker armor, and some simplified features; in addition, the hull was lengthened.

Dismissing the option to fit a smaller gun, the other option was to set the turret further back on the tank. The downside of this design was a decrease in the crew's field of vision and problems with weight distribution. The latter design was used for the E-100, Maus, and Loewe.

It was known for its unconventional turretless design, with a fixed gun traversed by engaging the tracks and elevated by adjusting the hull suspension. Turretless armoured fighting vehicles are usually classified as assault guns or tank destroyers, but the Strv 103 is considered a tank because of its gun laying ability and its designated combat role matches those of other tanks. It is the only main battle tank and the only tank of any kind since the World War II era to dispense with a turret. The Strv 103 was designed and manufactured in Sweden. It was developed in the 1950s and was the first main battle tank to use a turbine engine. The result was a very low-profile design with an emphasis on defence and heightened crew protection level. Strv 103s formed a major portion of the Swedish armoured forces from the 1960s to part of the 1990s, but have since been removed from service in favour of the Stridsvagn 122.

Contains 2 Tanks - 1/72 ScaleManufacturers Description:The Panzerkampfwagen V Panther is one of the best-known German tanks of World War II. The Panther and the Soviet T-34 are considered by many to be the best tanks of World War II.When in June of 1941, Germany invaded Russia, many KV series and T-34/76 tanks were encountered, which were far superior in firepower and armour protection to any Panzer at the time. It was then decided, because of the constant reports from the Eastern Front to design a new more powerful medium tank, which could be quickly put into production. Two versions were put forward, one closely based on the T34 design, the other (which went into production) a more sophisticated design.The Panther was the first German-made tank with sloping armour. Although its design was in some ways similar to the T-34/76, the Panther was larger, heavier, and different in many technical aspects. The Panther had large overlapping road wheels and a state-of-the-art suspension system that enabled it to traverse rough terrain at high speed.The Panther was armed with a 75mm KwK 42 L/70 gun, which was capable of penetrating almost 150mm thick armour at a range of 1000 meter; the Panthers 75mm gun had penetration slightly better than the 88mm gun of the Tiger.Box contains 2 tanks.

The JS-2, which was put into production in December 1943 during the latter half of WWII, had a long powerful 122mm gun and superior armor. From August, 1944 the hatch on the front glacis was deleted, which greatly improved its frontal protection.

The acronym RSO stands for Raupenschlepper Ost, which translates as “Caterpillar Tractor East”. The terrible muddy and icy conditions experienced on the Eastern Front convinced Germany of the need for a highly mobile, tracked vehicle. Steyr proposed the RSO and it immediately became a popular vehicle thanks to its mobility and reliability. In all, about 23,000 RSO vehicles were produced by a range of manufacturers. The original version had a pressed-steel cab and a typical truck-style cargo bed at the rear. It was powered by a Steyr 85hp V8 engine that offered a top speed of 30km/h. Dragon’s new 1/35 scale model depicts the standard RSO/01, this type with rounded steel cab being the best known of all the versions used by Germany. Indeed, the complex shape of the cab was created by a Japanese model-maker, and it is easily the most accurate cab available on the market today. The cab is a sophisticated piece of molding in terms of detail and measurements, with all the curves accurately reproduced in miniature. Many modelers have been waiting a long time for Dragon to produce this iconic version of the RSO, and they won’t be disappointed with this new kit. For those wishing to create a dynamic Eastern Front diorama scene, this RSO tractor will prove irresistible!",121,18

It was the smallest of the 'Big Four' railway regions with most of it's revenue coming from passenger traffic rather than freight in the more densely populated region of southern England. A number of famous 'named' trains were operated by SR including the Brighton Belle, Bournemouth Belle, Golden Arrow, the Night Ferry (London - Paris and Brussels), Atlantic Coast Express and the Devon Belle. Both Richard Maunsell and Oliver Bulleid served as Chief Mechanical Engineers to the SR between 1923 and 1948 and both designed new locomotives and rolling stock to replace those inherited in 1923. The electrification of the region began in 1929 under the management of Sir Herbert Walker. On completion it was the world's largest electrified railway system. Southern Railway gave the designation 2-BIL to the DC third rail electric multiple units built during the 1930s. The formation was a 2-car set: MBTL-DTCL, and were called 2-BIL (2-car Bi-Lavatory stock) because each set had two lavatories, one in each car. They were built to work long distance semi-fast services on the newly electrified lines from London to Eastbourne, Portsmouth and Reading. Between 1935 and 1938, a total of 152 sets of the Class 2-BIL were built in 4 batches and were numbered 2001-2152. Numbers 2001-2010 in 1935 for service on the London to Eastbourne sector.

Completed in 2008, Tornado was the first such locomotive built in the United Kingdom since Evening Star, the last steam locomotive built by British Railways, in 1960. Designed to meet modern safety and certification standards, Tornado runs on the UK rail network and on mainline-connected heritage railways.The locomotive was built by the A1 Steam Locomotive Trust, a charitable trust founded in 1990 to build Tornado and possibly further locomotives. Tornado was conceived as an evolution of the LNER Peppercorn Class A1 class, incorporating improvements likely had steam continued, and changes for cost, safety, manufacturing and operational benefits, while replicating the original design's sound and appearance. Tornado, completely new-built, is considered the 50th Peppercorn A1, numbered next in the class after 60162, Saint Johnstoun, built in 1949.Tornado moved under her own power for the first time on 29 July 2008 at Darlington, and then spent two months at the preserved Great Central Railway double-track tourist railway in Loughborough, where she was tested up to 60 mph (97 km/h) and operated her first passenger train. Tornado then moved to the National Railway Museum (NRM) in York for three test runs on the main line up to 75 mph (121 km/h). After repainting into LNER Apple Green, Tornado was approved for main-line passenger operation. On 31 January 2009 she hauled her first passenger trip on the main line, The Peppercorn Pioneer, from York to Newcastle and back. By hauling various A1 Trust railtours, charters and other activities, Tornado will begin to recoup the estimated £800,000 debt from the project, which cost around £3 million.The new Hornby model is represented in the familiar Apple Green of the early British Railways colour scheme.Young or old, keen modeller or just a beginner, the Hornby RailRoad range answers the needs of many and is a perfect complement to the variety of locomotives, rolling stock, track, buildings, and accessories that can be found in the current Hornby catalogue.

20,Dapol Stanier 57ft Non Corridor Brake Coach - OO Gauge Plastic Kit,9,14.99,2,1,5,"Dapol OO Gauge Stanier 57ft non corridor brake coach in BR Carmine Red Livery, unlined. Plastic model kit. Manufacturers Description: William Stanier (1876-1965) was headhunted from the GWR to become Chief Mechanical Engineer of London, Midland and Scottish (LMS) Railways in 1932. With the support of the Chairman, Sir Josiah Stamp, Stanier is credited with modernising the LMS fleet of generally small steam locomotives with a larger, modern and more powerful array of designs. Soon after his appointment, Stanier also focused on refurbishing and standardising the Coach stock of the LMS and developed the Period III LMS coaches which later became known as Stanier Coaches. These designs were extremely popular and successful and many were still in service in the mid 1960's. There are many examples of Period III coaches operating on Heritage Railways throughout the UK today. The Dapol OO Model of the Stanier Coach is derived from refurbished Airfix/Mainline tooling originally purchased by Dapol in the 1980's. There are some compromises on detail accuracy due to the condition and usability of the 40+ year old tooling. However, we feel the model captures the essence of the Period III coach design well and offers an extremely affordable way of building up a fleet of pre or post nationalised fleet of LMS coaches. Dapol have strived to ensure livery and colour details have been captured and are comparable to the originals, including the roof level gold lines. The Kit comes complete with decorated body, all that is required is painting of the roof and other components and assembly.

Originally numbered as LNER 2595, Trigo was the eleventh of twenty-seven A3s to be built as an A3, the other fifty-one were A1s that were later converted to A3s. All the A1 and A3 Class locomotives were named after famous race horses. Trigo was an Irish born race horse who won the Epsom Derby in 1929 making the horse famous and inspiring the LNE R to name one of their new locomotives after him. Trigo is modelled here as British Rail (BR) 60084 in BR blue from the era of June 1949 to August 1952, during this period Trigo pulled a Streamline type tender and was based at the Neville Hill shed in Leeds.

The A4 Class carried a unique streamline design that was inspired by the German ‘Flying Hamburger’ diesel trains. The A4 Pacific’s were built to haul the ‘Silver Jubilee Train’ which was a high-speed streamline train designed to offer a fast service between London King’s Cross and Newcastle, it was named this to celebrate King George VI’s Silver Jubilee that took place in 1935. During its inaugural journey it reached speeds of 112mph, setting a new world record. Built at the LNE R’s Doncaster works, Silver Link was built in only eleven weeks and entered into full service on the 7th September 1935. Silver Link was one of only four of the A4s to carry the two tone silver grey paint scheme. The model here depicts the locomotive during its LNER period between the years of 1935 and 1937.

Originally numbered 4498, Sir Nigel Gresley was due to receive the name Bittern, before the realisation of its commemorative status. As with the earlier LNER A4 Pacifics, it was built with a single chimney and side valances covering the wheels which were later removed to improve maintenance access. Sir Nigel Gresley carries a commemorative plaque as the holder of the post-war steam speed record reaching 112mph in May 1959. As with the Mallard’s record this was achieved descending southward from Stoke Summit, but unlike the Mallard’s special attempt this was with a full train of passengers returning from an excursion. As with other A4s, Sir Nigel Gresley has worn many liveries throughout its career. When released to traffic in October 1937 it carried the standard LNER garter blue of the A4 Pacifics and has since carried various liveries. Sir Nigel Gresley, now bearing the British Railways number 60007 with a British Railways blue livery, was saved from scrapping in 1966 by a small group of men who set up the ‘A4 Preservation Society’, later known as ‘The A4 Locomotive Society Ltd’ and now ‘The Sir Nigel Gresley Locomotive Preservation Trust Ltd’. ‘The A4 Locomotive Society’ has since become the subsidiary company that operates the locomotive for the Trust. The Trust is committed to keeping the locomotive operating and running special excursions on both the main line and heritage railways such as the North Yorkshire Moors Railway where it is based.This is an accurate, detailed scale model in die cast presented in a perspex display case mounted on a plinth.

It was a two-seat grand touring car with instruments housed in the steering wheel, a push-button transmission, exterior microphones to pick up and transmit traffic sounds, and a host of other innovative devices. It was a 'rolling laboratory' from which Ford would learn about new technology to apply to their production automobiles. The car was built entirely by hand in Turin, Italy and, like many concept cars, was never put into production. In the mid 1960's, George Barris of Barris Kustom City acquired the car directly from Ford.The story goes that he was approached by producers from Fox who were going to be doing a BATMAN TV Series and needed an exotic car. George sketched out a version of the Futura with suitable ""Bat"" alterations and presented it to the producers. George felt it was the perfect answer, considering the bat-like qualities his Futura already had and the fact that the car had to be ready for action in a mere three weeks. Sometime later in October of 1965, the BATMOBILE was born. This die-cast model will impress even the biggest BATMAN fan with its accuracy and excellent detail",81,8

It will reach 60 mph in just 2.9 seconds, and will go on to achieve a top speed of 217 mph. There has certainly been no shortage of 1:43 Lamborghini Aventador replicas of late, with Fujimi and Mattel already releasing their versions.

It is made up of around four times the number of components used to make your standard Minichamps 1:43. Of course, the doors, bonnet and boot all open; the rear wing is moveable, the exhaust is chrome plated, and all the intricate metal grills are photo etched.

1666,Corgi ST97501 Rail Legends NRM LNER 4-6-2 Mallard A4 Class 1:120 Scale Die Cast Stream Locomotive,10,23.75,9,14,4.6,"Product Description During the 1930s the railway companies were starting to feel the increased competition from air and road travel as the demand for speed, efficiency and luxury grew. Despite the proved success of the A3s, Gresley and his engineers needed to take the next step to become quicker and more efficient. Whilst looking at ways to progress he travelled to Germany and America looking at their evolvement but because of size restrictions on the British railway network he discovered that their larger locomotives were not an option. It was then that chief designer Sir Nigel Gresley looked into aerodynamics, thus creating the ‘Silver Jubilee’ streamlined trains which were inspired by a Bugatti rail-car that he observed on a trip to France. After wind tunnel tests it was also discovered that not only could they achieve greater speeds whilst using less energy, the design also meant that an updraft off the locomotive pushed the steam upwards giving the driver improved driving vision. Over a three year period between 1935 and 1938 there were a total of thirty five A4s built at the LNER's Doncaster works. The first four A4s all had the word 'Silver' in the title, this was in relation to the King George V Silver Jubilee, five were named after Commonwealth countries but with Gresley being a keen bird watcher, the majority were named after fast flying birds. Arguably the most famous of all the class is the Mallard, carrying the distinctive streamline casing in Garter Blue, the appearance of this A4 depicts the 1930s real captivation with speed and luxury. The Mallard was the locomotive chosen to attempt breaking the world speed record, on the 3rd July 1938 heading south at Stoke Bank near Grantham, the Mallard broke the record measuring 125.88mph. To this day it still holds the record for being the fastest steam locomotive in the world. The Mallard is now part of the National Railway Collection on static display at Shildon.

1700,Oxford Diecast Austin 3 Way Van Wynns 76AK013,124,6.75,5,1,5,"WYNNS was established in Newport, Monmouthshire, in 1863. Its founder, Thomas Wynn was originally employed on the railways, but soon saw a need for an improved ""onward distribution"" system after goods were unloaded from the trains. Using a fleet of horses and carts, he transported goods that were delivered directly to Newport by rail and soon formed an association with a local flourmill, delivering flour to bakeries and shops in the local valleys. An association that carried on until well into the 1950s, when the mill had to close. After the death of Thomas Wynn in 1878, his 15 year-old son, Robert Wynn (who later gave his name to the company) took over the business with the help of his eldest sister, Emma. The business continued to grow and Robert saw the possibilities for heavy haulage as the steel works in Newport were developed. In 1890 he built a boiler wagon capable of carrying 40 tons of heavy machinery with the propulsion still provided by up to 48 horses. The K8 (3 Way) Van commenced production in 1947 and the van cost £535. It earned the name 3-Way due to the door configuration. To assist loading and unloading, it featured double doors on the near and offside, as well as opening near doors. With a payload of 25 cwt and a short wheelbase, it proved a very nippy vehicle for delivery purposes. The van was discontinued in 1954, by which time over 26,500 had been manufactured.

2203,Revell 1:72 Scale US Navy Skipjack Class Submarine,160,38.37,21,4,5,"Product Description The USS Skipjack (SSN-585) was the first US Navy nuclear attack submarine with ahydro-dynamically optimized tear-drop shape. The hull was a single pressure hullwith circular cross-section made of high strength HY-80 steel. A visual feature was that the forward diving planes were fin-mounted for the first time. The six torpedo tubes in the bow could fire a total of 24 torpedoes. The newly developedS5W nuclear reactor enabled her to remain submerged for a long period and her range was only limited by food stores. The shipyard test run confirmed sensational performance with a top speed of over 30 knots when dived. When the USS Skipjack was transferred to the fleet on 15th April 1959, the US Navy received its first true submersible that could operate submerged for months at atime to secure the safety of fast-moving fleet units.

2254,Matchbox Smokey The Fire Truck,757,49.97,5,29,4.5,"Product Description Smokey the Fire Truck reporting for duty Meet the newest rescue hero with the biggest personality around: Smokey the Fire Truck. Putting out fires and warming your heart, Smokey is not only a hero, he's a best friend that talks, sings and dances. Smokey is a freewheeling friend, with a huge cannon that kids can move around and shoot, launching balls that represent water to help Smokey put out the fire. With over 90 phrases, sounds and silly jokes, motion sensors in his wheels, LED lights on his head and motorised movement, Smokey provides hours of open-ended play. When Smokey is on all six wheels, he is in Truck Mode. Push Smokey forward or pull him backward to activate lights and sounds. Push the lighting buttons on top to activate even more, giving plenty of variety to your child's playtime. Smokey can be pulled halfway or completely upright using the lever on his right. Whether halfway or fully, he is then in Character Mode. Raise and lower Smokey repeatedly to make him sing and dance. Smokey knows four different songs, but to keep up the variety, he won't sing every time. Keep trying if you really want to hear him sing. When Smokey is pulled upright, he can also shoot his 'water' cannon balls. Load the three supplied balls into the chute, turn the cannon left, right, back or forward to aim and then pull the lever on the left to shoot. (Warning: Do not aim at eyes or face. Only use the projectiles supplied with this toy. Do not fire at point-blank range.) Smokey will also fall asleep if he is left alone for a while. He'll let you know that he's going to take a break and he'll even start snoring. To wake him up again, simply press his lights or push him around and Smokey will be back on the job. Packed with fun, laughter and action, Smokey the Fire Truck is set to become one of your child's favourite toys. Smokey the Fire Truck requires 4 x C batteries (demonstration batteries are included) and is suitable for ages 3 and up. It is not intended for outdoor use; sand, dirt and water may cause malfunction. Smokey is part of the Big Rig Buddies range from Matchbox, one of the most well-known and widely acclaimed brands in the world of toys and a manufacturer of quality diecast cars, trackets and other boys' toys for nearly 60 years. It is now owned by Mattel, a market leader in the industry. Pull the lever on Smokey's side to raise or lower him. Push the button on Smokey's roof to hear him talk. Pull the lever on the cannon to shoot 'water' balls. After putting out the fire, Smokey even sings and dances.",81,8

The Gran Turismo body shape was aerodynamically optimised and resulted in a perfect combination of suitability for purpose and beauty. The front of the 250 GTO was particularly attractive due to the three cooling vents for the 2953 cc engine. The 250 stood for the capacity of one of the 12 engine cylinders, the O for omologato (= type approved), the FIA approval for races in the GT class. The GTO was shown for the first time in 1962. Thanks to its 300 hp engine and good aerodynamics it achieved a speed of about 280 km/h with acceleration from 0 to 100 in just 5.6 seconds. For three whole years (1962, 1963 and 1964) the GTO dominated its racing class in inimitable style. Box Contains 1 x Revell 07077 - 1:24 Scale Ferrari 250 GTO1 x Instruction Manual",81,8

A nice little touch is the pair of Union Flags on the side of the engine cowling above the front wheels, as well as the Field Marshall logo which also features on the side in silver. The Lincolnshire based company of Marshall, Sons & Co started manufacturing tractors in 1930, the year which saw the launch of the single cylinder Marshall 15/30. Various upgrades were introduced during the 1930s, although production was reduced during the war years when the factory was engaged in war work. The Field Marshall - a much improved tractor - was introduced immediately after WWII with the Series 1 (1945-1947). Series 2 followed between 1947 and 1949, Series 3 (1949-1953) and finally Series 3A (1953-1957). Up to the time of Series 3, which had an optional electric starter, the starting mechanism was by present standards, quite antiquated. The method comprised a smouldering piece of paper containing saltpetre, which was inserted into the cylinder head by means of a special screw-in holder in the cylinder head. The driver then had to crank up the engine with a starting handle. The main uses for the Field Marshall Tractor included pulling agricultural machinery from place to place, such as threshing machines. Once in situ, they were a familiar sight in use as the power plant with a belt pulley coupled by a large flat drive belt to the pulley of the secondary machine.",81,8

The Ford Fordor sedan was ideal for this purpose. At 4.9m long it was powered by a 90 bhp 6-cylinder 3.7litre engine and was produced between February 1942 until June 1945. As a result of rationing, the military version of the model 1942 was produced without chrome trim although this was a feature of the civilian version.

The TKS was an improved model with a new hull and a more powerful engine. The armour of the TK was up to 8 mm thick (10 mm on the TKS). In 1939, re-arming of the tankettes with 38FK 20 mm machine guns began, but only about 24 were completed before the outbreak of World War II. The 575 TK/TKS tankettes formed the bulk of the Polish armoured forces before the outbreak of war. They suffered heavy losses during the Invasion of Poland, often being the only armoured fighting vehicles available. Due to their light armament of a single machine gun, they stood no chance in combat against German tanks, except the Panzer I, but their small size suited them for reconnaissance and infantry support. Only the handful of tankettes armed with 20 mm guns had a fighting chance against the enemy tanks; in one instance on 18 September 1939 a 20 mm gunned TKS with Nkm wz.38 FK commanded by Podchorazy or Officer Candidate in the rank of SFC Roman Orlik destroyed three German Panzerkampfwagen 35(t) tanks. After conquest of Poland, the tankettes were taken over and used by the Germans. In this role they saw various uses, mostly for training, security duties or artillery tractors.
